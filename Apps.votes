A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B00ANT8OF6 4 1360972800 69 My son plays this game all the time. He loves Umizoomi. He has all the badges and trophies for the first two levels on here, but the others will not unlock. I don't know how many times you have to replay the same two games, but now he's had it for months and is sick of it because it's just to long to wait for something else to happen.
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B00AMR1HZ8 4 1360972800 54 I love thus game and play it often, but it is not fair at all. It gives you way to long to answer the puzzle. It's like a minute for each player. If I can't get in soon I just press &#34;give up&#34; because I think it's a cheat to take so much time.
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B004WGGQPQ 5 1360972800 35 Backgrounds, shapes, colors, textures, stickers, this game has it all and it's simple enough for my two year old to play on his own. If I could only have one app, it'd be this one!
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B006C1ZSO4 5 1360972800 38 I think this is a fun, fast paced game. I'm 21 years old and play, I've passed it around the family and they all seemed to like it and laugh about it too. Teenagers, toddlers, and elderly alike!
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B008LY1B32 4 1360972800 25 This game is played just like the real game of dominos, unlike some digital copies that change things to make it easier. I like that.
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B007KPT2N4 1 1360972800 47 My toddler loves the look of the icon and always wants to play &#34;magic dog&#34;. Once he gets on he gets very frustrated. Nothing is straight forward and he has never been able to play a whole game. I can't even figure how to open some parts.
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B0080JJLBW 5 1360972800 35 My son is two years old and loves dora and diego. This game teaches him words that rhyme, inside sounds, letters, he plays for quite awhile and he's really learning as he goes further along.
A00100742Q4O8VH0YMUBZ B009P8EMCK 5 1384560000 21 My three year old can search through and watch shows on his own. He loves the ease and the great shows!
A001619027H9L9EG4UVRB B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392768000 22 So much easier than floppy bird so better so I live this game already so I decide u play this game k
A001619027H9L9EG4UVRB B00H0BGCJK 5 1386979200 24 I really like games with monsters but it just got me so happy when I saw Fire it takes skill to .fight love it
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00EDQ35D6 4 1397520000 32 The makers of these games always force adds for other games and reviews down your throat. It's an interesting game but they should give player more room to play without the pushing.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00CX9P6V4 4 1379894400 36 Within 5 minutes of play and after about as many pics they are willing to &quot;pay&quot; for a review....makes me wonder why. I like the concept of the game, I hope the product can meet expectations.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00FIW5BZE 5 1395878400 52 I have a lot of mahjong games...both free and paid for.  This one has just replace a couple of my others as one I will play regularly. It has a lot of boards in the free game and a lot more to unlock if I want to buy it...which I probably will.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B006JNH7YY 5 1381708800 171 I really like this type of game. The storyline was predictable though. Gave five stars  mainly because it is a good time waster. It is not one of my favorites and may not play again. Had plenty of hunt and find but I felt some were pointless. They didn't need all they put in and the story would've flowed better without some of them but I think they wanted to make sure purchaser had more game time. Which I am all for. But maybe they  could've put in more mini puzzles n place of the pointless hunt and finds. This sounds bad and you may be wondering why I gave it five stars, the game played well with no glitches and it can't be easy to try to make a game to please everyone. G5 has never failed in making games I enjoy. They deserve the stars because I just may be too critical you should definitely try the game yourself. You will get your money worth of time spent playing.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00BX42FLY 4 1397520000 31 I have played a lot of these games. I enjoy spending time with my kids trying to figure out the harder ones. Getting it as the faotd makes it even better.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00BPC23XO 5 1364947200 58 I have played several versions of this game and what sets this one apart from the others is that you choose how much help you need.  It starts showing you only one picture,  with other three hidden. You can get between 2 &amp; 5 points per set of pictures. I really like having the pictures revealed this way.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B009M6N37A 4 1402617600 76 I have played a lot of mahjong games over the years, this one isn't the worst I have played. The graphics are nice and the fact that I can turn the music and noises off is a big bonus. But the game is glitch. In the middle of play it will stop n boot me. That doesn't endear this version enough to buy the full version. If that gets fixed it will be one to buy.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00CJ77HU8 5 1377302400 36 Couldn't beat the price so I thought I'd give it a try. It's faster paced than some of the other games out there, which I like. Works well on my kindle. So far. Wonderful for relaxing.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00CRHF748 3 1378166400 98 So i picked out a few of the free puzzles, one of them was the sea shells pack. I was down to the last two pieces. I looked at the last two pieces, then went back and swiped my finger over the puzzle to see if I had messed up. Nope, the last two pieces didn't fit the two spaces I had left. I realize I am using a free puzzle but this doesn't induce to buy the app. Otherwise I love the game and enjoy playing. Except when I have left over pieces that don't fit puzzle.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00AR1AUAW 5 1375228800 22 I play this game to help me unwind while also working my brain.  I don't like the ads and constant pop ups
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B007A2IPF8 4 1383004800 134 I like games that aren't too easy. This one is definitely not too easy. It's also got a nice mix of games. My biggest problem with it is that it keeps wanting you to advertise for them in facebook. I don't go on Facebook and definitely don't want to let everyone know all my guilty pleasures. I wish that like sound effects there was a button so you could turn this off. Also, game lost the star because it asked me after every chapter to leave a review. If I like your game I won't need to be asked to review it. This should b knocked back to every fourth or fifth level. I didn't hit the don't ask again because I intended to leave one....so fix your game so it stops pestering people.
A002359833QJM7OQHCXWY B00BYG452I 3 1375142400 29 It is a fun game. Putting picture together myself to get answer would've been better. Not sure I trust an app that pays for ratings within first ten pics
A0037670NPLI11RBWYFA B00AA0TOG6 3 1359849600 88 This game is much more challenging than it appears to be at first. I love the use of tools to help get players from one level to another. The &#34;out-of-the-box&#34; thinking that is required is enjoyable and challenging. However, only one hint is provided at each level, and it is not always helpful. Since there is no other strategy guide, going online for help is a nuisance. It is also frustrating to have to begin each level from the start when you  repeatedly get burned or eaten, etc.
A003841815JTX0JFLR8B1 B00CKW6FVE 5 1370390400 27 When I am board I find myself drawn to this app I love piecing the puzzle together it is so much fun and it is definitely entertaining
A003841815JTX0JFLR8B1 B00E1GOGJK 5 1375660800 28 This app is fun I am mostly rating it that way it will give me better developed pictures cause it's hard to tell what some of them are
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B009GXHOW4 5 1362787200 39 IF YOU CURRENTLY HAVE MINECRAFT PE FOR ANY TABLET OR PHONE GET THIS. YOU CAN ADD ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT INTO YOUR INVENTORY IN SURVIVAL . NOW I DONT HAVE TO GO MINING ANYMORE I ALREADY HAVE 255 DIAMONDS
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B00846GKTW 4 1361664000 20 this game is pretty cool because it is realistic all the other dress ups have to do with animated figures
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B00AO2P3GA 3 1367712000 28 So I'm aloud to get any app I want and I don't wanna spend. 6.99 on ANYTHING. Pleease lower the price to. 99 so I can buy it
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B00GTCECVG 5 1390435200 28 This game. is very fun and blows clash of clans out of the water. long live castle clash and hopefully u will get it too Cu's its funAssassin67
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B00DYOOGYK 5 1374537600 21 This is so much cooler than gangster Rio thank your gameloft.This is so fun to play on road trips!!!!!!!!!! thanks again
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B00APKHA9Y 5 1367193600 32 really fun,best of its kind,but it needs to have updates,multiplayer would be cool to add and when I play my Huns are glithced and they look rainbowy.please fix this bit.Overall its awesome.
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B009NOQG9S 4 1362355200 43 This is really good for an app that was not made by mojang officially I used Honeydews skin and it worked perfectly the only downfall is that; honeydew maybe the only skin I have yet to find any others overall its good XD
A0038872349TB5N0JHQQW B008G0HTUU 5 1351555200 27 fun this is 1 of the best games I have ever played.  download it it is worth it I'm telling u it is very fun a awesome
A00455683H6M1GQZMPQPV B00702PZME 5 1387756800 22 This is a fun free app (although there is a paid version). It's not awe inspiring, does exactly what it promises. Recommended!
A00455683H6M1GQZMPQPV B004UBB1HQ 5 1398643200 46 I can't express how happy I am to have found this app to read and re-read the graphic novels I had already bundled up on my laptop. It's a real joy! And it organizes all the books in shelf like GUI. That's a nice touch too.
A00455683H6M1GQZMPQPV B00KWVZ750 5 1405641600 36 It was a brave attempt to take the angry birds franchise to a turn based RPG genre. And since the game doesn't take itself too seriously, it actually works! And a ton of fun to play.
A00455683H6M1GQZMPQPV B00CSR2J9I 5 1394668800 42 Is the driving realistic, no. Is the physics realistic, no. But it's a ton of fun trying to get the utterly undrivable vehicles over the steep bumps. And of course upgrade your favourite cars and chase the targets in various different surfaces.
A0047670XAAJD587LXS7 B00BHHIWQO 3 1370822400 53 I love diamond dash .! &lt;3 But the only problem i have with it is that the app takes pretty much about 5 minutes to load ! And sometimes it won't even load and this app keeps freezing! This is an OUTRAGE ! But still a good app / game ! {-: ^O^&lt;3
A0047670XAAJD587LXS7 B008Y7SMQU 4 1356134400 26 Good!! This game is a fun game for game nights. Which you can use to see just about how good you are at recognizing different brands.
A0047670XAAJD587LXS7 B00BS3UFCQ 5 1367625600 41 I downloaded this app yesterday, thinking that it'd be a not so fun game. but it's a great app !  My kids love it and they just can't get enough of guessing all the movies that they've seen ! *.* ^~^
A00501041JRAPWYLPQ4TE B00CUWWLWG 1 1392163200 22 I downloaded this App but uninstalled it because it hangs up my kindle fire. Would really love to play this game. :(
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B00AZOVLUO 4 1368921600 21 my computer would not load it as it said there was too much risk to have it put on my machine
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B0066T0BTO 5 1356566400 28 I really like playing this version of bejeweled. It is one of the better match 3 games I have found.The price is right and the graphics are good
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B0063GORYU 5 1356566400 43 Have always liked playing spider solitaire and its nice to know that you can still get it on the more modern machines. I like the way you can cjustomize it to fit you. aWould recommend this product to anyone who plays spider solitaire
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B005TB7TRC 2 1380067200 21 I chose this review because the game is kind of fun but is very simple and not much challenge to it
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B00H1L6L86 4 1388361600 66 Got the game for my kindle. Play it on my laptop all the time so thought I would download it to my kindle. It isn't quite as good as it is on the computer but it is still fun to play and I enjoy it a lot more than a lot of the games I have. I like that there are several different games in one
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B00CNT8KW6 3 1380067200 23 Game is fun and keeps you interested. Is a little slow compared to a lot of the slot games but is still fun.
A00507662MEMHI1YMGQ15 B009O2XY12 4 1356566400 33 This game is ok. Do not like the graphics quite as much as alot of these types of games but it is fun to play. The graphics are good and ot works well
A006458827ALF2J23JJTO B00HTYNMWS 5 1401926400 32 Good night and then then I can get a new one on the phone is the best way for you to go to bed now so I don't want you to me
A006458827ALF2J23JJTO B00K7C17QW 5 1402617600 23 Go ahead with a lot to be said about the same way to be in my life is good for you and I
A007209714VJJNG4NW2QV B00GY0HJ4K 5 1390262400 25 I enjoy this game more then Candy Crush and I don't feel I need to spend money to advance levels. It's an option not needed.
A007209714VJJNG4NW2QV B00COVCV50 3 1373587200 21 I found it short but fun. My kids love it. It's helping my 6 year old with groupings and common items.
A007209714VJJNG4NW2QV B00G4NUQYM 5 1394323200 36 Crossword puzzles get boring after a bit, over and over repeats. Nit to mention it never changes. Down, across. This gives a different level of difficulty. From my children to my parents mind boggling fun (4-68)
A008303317XYE4TYCHUN B00H59CTW6 4 1396656000 69 My only negative is that it moves so slow. The purchasing of the items and then having to wait so long for completion. I really like that it offers opportunity to earn the coins, so many games only offer the purchase of them, so that is a big plus. So if you make any improvements based on reviews I hope to see faster turn around on the game. :)
A008303317XYE4TYCHUN B00B4VI8MQ 3 1399939200 40 So far I'm liking it but if I have to pay for every new episode I know it will be a short lived game for me because it took 3 hours to load what seems to be just one episode.
A0090495K0FTJUG4CPSA B008JGSM6G 5 1350604800 34 This simple game is addictive fun and reminiscent of brain training games I have played in the past. While the concept is easy to grasp the game remains challenging and only grows more so.
A0090495K0FTJUG4CPSA B00ANGMT0U 5 1360195200 34 I keep being drawn back. It's fun to send ships on voyages and expand to find new people. Upgrading shops and ships brings in the funds quicker. Wish we could upgrade the houses too.
A0090495K0FTJUG4CPSA B007PT3QOQ 4 1353369600 30 While it's not the game I remember, it's still a bit of fun. If you've enjoyed games like frontier ville you'll probably enjoy this. Could use an easier energy refresh.
A01024593CWXRU608RV19 B00A42SC5E 1 1356912000 29 why did they make this game!? it realy stinks! it so boring. all u do is swipe your fingers until the little crapy ninja with a crapy face dies!!!
A01024593CWXRU608RV19 B00FAX6XQC 5 1392508800 26 I cant explain how amazing this game is its fun and scary but a good type of scary. its just al freaking fun!!! please play :)
A01024593CWXRU608RV19 B00AA0TJO8 5 1356912000 30 this game is the funest game in the universe you will get addicted to it after a minute and when you play different levels it will get fun and fun!
A01024593CWXRU608RV19 B00769WNK8 4 1357430400 35 it is very fun and I like it but its just that it gets harder and at one point it will suck more then American dad. WICH REALY SUCKS!!!!!!!????  :( :) :D :( its boring.
A01024593CWXRU608RV19 B009UX2YAC 5 1356912000 21 this game is so fun I enjoy it sooooooo much and it is so eddicting I can not stop playing it
A01024593CWXRU608RV19 B006PH7WBM 4 1391990400 32 I don't like the fact you need to use your own real money in this. it pisses me off. over all I think that its fun and my little sister likes it.
A01102333B05IISDI7UEA B007XFC648 1 1381708800 20 Not a fun game Disappointed is an understatement. ICK made many purchases not happy with any of them  at all.
A011523719HXWV9BRWPC0 B008CGZZHW 5 1358553600 20 this is just like the original game you get in the box.one or more people can play. I like it.
A011523719HXWV9BRWPC0 B00A2BJSE6 5 1358553600 21 this is a good game to play. simple and easy to use. make time go by. not to bad to play.
A01248892ZRML4IDQHQG1 B00G9EZ448 5 1394928000 30 Omg so glad I found skip-bo! This is our #1 game we play when friends are over. Now I can play it whenever I want to and it's a challenge.
A01248892ZRML4IDQHQG1 B00BGC5UAG 4 1363392000 20 Very very addicting hard to put it down some are super easy and some are very hard. I love it
A01341905GWNB6HMUPJF B00G5LQ5MU 5 1390176000 25 This game is so cool I wish I had more money so I could buy the full version so you should really get this game.
A01341905GWNB6HMUPJF B00CAK052Q 5 1378252800 28 When I played it I thought it was easy then I got to the end it got a little hard but I thought it was awesome and amazing
A01341905GWNB6HMUPJF B00CQ9U1PW 5 1384646400 21 IT IS REALLY FUNNY AND GOOD GAME YOU SHOULD REALLY GET IT YOU WILL LOVE IT SO MUCH SO  GET IT..
A01341905GWNB6HMUPJF B00E994GPI 5 1386892800 37 WHEN I downloaded it was awesome and it was a very good idea to have a game that was fun and it let me make my own name up you should get this game I recommend it.
A01837361LYNLJSD6GKE3 B00B9FNHOG 5 1402272000 25 It's amazing for being free, very cool and fun. It drains the battery like crazy thoughIf you like rts games then give it a go
A01837361LYNLJSD6GKE3 B00A3E2BVE 5 1358726400 51 Songpop is addicting and fun and it works really well on Kindle. While it's a little faster via a web browser, the app is everything that a game app should be, you just might want to bring along your headphones if you don't want to annoy everyone else in the room
A01837361LYNLJSD6GKE3 B006PJ3UKC 4 1358726400 90 I think that this app is a great free news app, however, some of the controls such as how to access specific news can be more than a little confusing. It is great that they organized everything but making you choose a category from the home page rather than simply scrolling through everything can be time consuming. On the other hand, if you simply want to look at one type of news such as sports or so, it is a lot more organized than if you had to scroll through.
A01837361LYNLJSD6GKE3 B0094BB4TW 4 1358726400 73 I like the app and it usually works how it should but I have noticed two very distinct problems1. I frequently get 'Facebook has Stopped' and the app restarts2. It sometimes does not connect to the internet despite my email and web browser working fine.I think this is a great app that could use  a bit more work to get rid of the glitches and then it's really just Facebook for your Kindle.
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B007AL48UK 5 1383782400 26 I love Mahjong so i loved this game. Just a simple relaxing majong game with summer symbols. It was a great way to spend spare time.
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B00BG3ID0Y 5 1363824000 35 It makes you think and its a great way to spend ur leisure or free time. It's fun top okay with friends and to ask them what it is. I highly recommend it! It's free!
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B00BNH1PF8 5 1364169600 32 It makes you think and have fun. You get confused from time to time, but that's what makes it challenging. It's fun to play with friends. I recommend it for all ages.
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B007PW1BRC 4 1383782400 54 I love phase ten. I just wish i could pay the whole game, but the free version is pretty nice. The phases don't go in order though and most of the time you will lose, however it's a fun way to spend spare time or if you're a new player, to learn  the game.
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B008PB2ZVI 5 1383782400 38 I love escape games, but i admit this one has me stumped a couple times. This cheat guide helped me a lot through ones that i did not understand. It was very thorough, step by step, and successful.
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B00B99KJR0 2 1383782400 67 I was disappointed because on the beginning of my purchase i thought there would be a plot similar to that of the movie or maybe some extra puzzles or outside the box thinking to be necessary but this game is just like bejeweled and it was a waste. It did however go back and forth from the movie but the game has nothing to do with it.
A019524626WJQ6Q3E8ZRY B00594XOZU 4 1359072000 23 Kik was a quick and popular way of instant messaging. it was easy and free! I absolutely loved it! I highly recommend it.
A01961902L18E0CEAXEJU B0091QS88K 5 1357603200 87 I played this a couple of times, but it was too easy for my age.  My little sisters LOVE this game and play it ALL the time.  They are 3 and 6.  It is easy to follow, fun making the shakes and you can use any flavor even tho it always shows blueberry.  Also you can wash the tables and dishes.  I would DEFINATELY recommend this to the younger ages.  As for the older kids...I would recommend Diner Dash it is much more fun and more challenging.
A01961902L18E0CEAXEJU B00A7ICO7C 4 1357603200 81 I hate having to change things up on my device every season, but i love the original. i would recomend this to older children...who can wait on things. Overall its fun, so if you like changing it up go ahead but if you dont let me give you some advice and space on your device. Either choose your favorate holiday and stick with it, or just stay with the original since they are all the the same. I love this game!!!
A01961902L18E0CEAXEJU B00A3HQX2Y 4 1357603200 68 I am not much on the holiday remakes.  Although I really like the original.  I do not have the patience to keep uploading, just to delete shortly after I upload it.  The original and the holidays are basically the same, so if you enjoy changing things up all the time you will probably really like this.  But if you are more like me, the original is the BEST!!
A01961902L18E0CEAXEJU B00A0YXZVW 5 1357603200 89 I LOVE this game.  It is so much fun...you get to buy, train and make your horses race.  Also you get to take care of them by washing, brushing, feeding and petting them.  It can keep you occupied for a long time.  You can upgrade your farm to allow more stables and more horses to take care of and race.  You can saddle and prepare it for races.  Also, you get to grow crops to help earn training points.If you LOVE horses...This is DEFINATELY the BEST Horse game ever!!!
A01961902L18E0CEAXEJU B005JT3YNC 2 1357603200 62 I would not recommend this to ANYONE...unless you appreciate floating frosting.  It is annoying to make cupcakes with frosting that is not actually attached to the cupcake and instead floats above it.  I only like the selection of toppings.  I will be removing this application and not waste the space.  You may want to save your space and not bother playing this.
A01961902L18E0CEAXEJU B005ZXWMUS 4 1357603200 43 I really LOVE the wide selection of FREE movies.  Although the picture is a bit blurry you can still enjoy the movie.  This is GREAT for ALL ages!!  I would recommend this for anyone that can appreciate a movie based on the sound.
A02049035W9C30B2NBJM B00DJFIMW6 5 1391558400 26 my daughter LOVES this game, it is probably her favorite game.  I will hear her in another room giggling at the game, she really loves it!
A02106571GXPKUGH1WTX9 B008IJTFYW 4 1382227200 31 As someone else pointed out in his review, sound selection is great however it is a potty it does not play as background. Whenever it does, it would 've a hit!
A02106571GXPKUGH1WTX9 B005AKD836 2 1376179200 32 I cannot figure out how to set it up with my Kindle. It takes too much input for getting any interesting suggestions. You need to schedule some time to make it work
A02106571GXPKUGH1WTX9 B0064X7FVE 5 1379808000 23 Great app. A must if u are on a busy business travel schedule. Would make packing easy and not time consuming.. well done
A02106571GXPKUGH1WTX9 B004SOR4H6 4 1376179200 23 An interesting tool to following trends and  latest developments in your field of interest. Easy to use if not familiar with social network.
A02177511W30G10OA67V9 B005EHQGTS 5 1405036800 3 i love it
A021888930M9DTEV5XH4J B004SOR4H6 4 1352246400 26 I FIND THAT THIS IS MORE THAN CAPABLE AS A TWITTER PRODUCTAND I RECOMMEND ITS USE FOR ANDROID PRODUCTSI HAVE A D2 AND DOWNLOAD WAS FLAWLESS
A021888930M9DTEV5XH4J B004K4RY9M 4 1353369600 26 HAVE A D2 AND WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD AND VERY SIMPLE GAMETO USE. I WOULD HAVE LIKED A FEW MORE WORDS PER GAMEBUT OTHERWISE IS GOOD
A021888930M9DTEV5XH4J B006HJKKCG 5 1352246400 34 I DIDNT THINK IT WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ADVERTISEDBUT WAS WRONG, I HAVE A D2 AND IT WAS EASY TODOWNLOAD & INSTALLI USED IT AND FOUND IT WAS ACCURATE SO FARTHANK YOU AMAZON
A021888930M9DTEV5XH4J B0062RM1VQ 5 1353369600 26 HAVE A D2 AND THE DOWNLOAD WAS EASY FROM THE AMAZON STORE.THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS AVAILABLE WAS WHAT SOLD ME ON THEAPP AND I JUST LOVE IT.
A021888930M9DTEV5XH4J B0064TVQ5E 5 1357257600 19 I enjoy playing this on my D2 and it is very addictive.I recommend this for any with a tablet.
A021888930M9DTEV5XH4J B0094BB4TW 4 1353369600 23 HAVE A D2 AND WAS VERY SIMPLE TO DOWNLOAD.IT WAS VERY EASY TO SIGN IN AND USE.COMPARED TO ONLINE VERSION IT WAS FAIR.
A0220159ZRNBTRKLG08H B004SJ3BCI 5 1356566400 26 This is a must have application.I thought the game was stupid at first, but after playing it for a few !HOURS! I realized its flipping amazing.
A0220159ZRNBTRKLG08H B00A757EFW 5 1394582400 29 How can you not like this game. It is a classic.If you don't know what pac-man is, I am sorry for you.This is a good game and it works.
A0220159ZRNBTRKLG08H B004GFN11A 3 1394668800 27 Nice to have and this app does work.But if you are concerned about security of your wordpress site, using XMLRPC would probably not be a good thing.
A02210112V2SJZXSWVHIT B006QCMPWM 3 1377388800 30 I liked breeding and taking care of the fish, but it would stop working if I breed a lot of fish quickly and didn't let the graphics run it's course.
A02210112V2SJZXSWVHIT B008TMA1LY 5 1358899200 65 The game has very cute graphics and has simple game play. The rewards button is very helpful in getting kitty points without paying and extra money. The Facebook button lets you get an instant cake maker which makes life way easier for your cafe and for you. I really liked this game, it is addictive and fun, just what I would expect from Hello Kitty.
A022410133YCDOZIC7OL2 B0063M22QO 4 1363996800 23 The many layouts and levels of play make this game both challenging  and fun.  I also like the opportunity to get a hint.
A022410133YCDOZIC7OL2 B009RLG7RI 5 1368144000 20 I just plain enjoy playing it!! It fun trying to beat the crazy bird and frustrating when you don't!!  Enjoy!!
A022410133YCDOZIC7OL2 B005ZXWMUS 5 1368144000 80 I chose to rate Netflix with 5 stars because I enjoy the varied options to choose between TV shows (especially those out of the UK and Austrailia), movies that build on faith and values which can be watched with any member of the family, and the ease of use.I recommend it to those who tend to those who prefer less sex and violence.  I also recommend it to those who enjoy a good movie/program with a message for the good.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B00FIP4SLO 5 1390348800 20 Really fun and thought provoking. Makes you think how some of the words really go together. Definitely try this game
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B009KS4XRO 4 1377561600 39 I love this game. It is so much fun to play. I just wish you could earn more bingo tokens daily. But if I skip a day or two than I get enough to play the games I want.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B0088Y7YHW 5 1361404800 27 This game is so much fun! I cannot find another slot game as much fun as this one. I completely recommend this game!!! Try it for yourself.

A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B00CMF27DE 5 1369440000 23 I love bingo and i love cats so this game is the best of both. Try it and i think you will agree.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B00D3ULE1I 5 1377734400 26 This game is so much fun to play. I am so glad I downloaded this game. I am sure any slots lover will agree with me.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B00CD6R17O 5 1376438400 23 This game is super fun! Easy to use and great for when i'm waiting for an appointment or just relaxing in the den.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B009WJNXAE 5 1377216000 23 I love this bingo game! It is so much fun and easy to use. I think all bingo lovers should try it out.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B00HRMNKWE 5 1390694400 24 I love this game, but it would be better if occasionally the words weren't missing the last letter which makes it a bit harder.
A02270292XRR4GL0CHNH6 B009WO7NQO 5 1352419200 27 Love Star Wars and Angry Birds, so this is the best of 2 things I love. Can't wait to show my daughters, they're gonna love it too.
A0234333Y79FWDA9ZQIU B00AK2RHR2 4 1359849600 40 This game is so much fun. I have it on my desktop computer too! But the free version is short loved. You gotta buy the full version to get the full effect of the game. I really like it though.
A0234333Y79FWDA9ZQIU B00AQF8CJ0 4 1370476800 21 This game is a great pass time. Easy to figure out and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy.
A0234333Y79FWDA9ZQIU B00A02220E 5 1359936000 60 This app is hilarious!! The cards are adorable and they make my day!! I get on here to send one person a card and end up looking at all of them and sending like 5 of them. Some of them have pretty mild humor but it don't bother me none! If I could rate it a billion stars I would.
A02348812LOACG43OG34R B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393113600 22 This game is easier than any related game to flappy bird!! Go and buy this game RIGHT NOW IF YOU DID NOT!!!!
A02348812LOACG43OG34R B007ZGO7EM 5 1384041600 36 I need to add up my amount of money I need for my school book fair and I immediately got on my kindle and opened this app.it only took me about a minute.this app I'd AWESOME!!!
A02348812LOACG43OG34R B00HBVON72 5 1389398400 25 I love it it can be hard but easy and fun at the same time.I hope they make more games like this.this game is AWESOME
A02348812LOACG43OG34R B00AA0TJO8 5 1388448000 35 The game is AWESOME!!!!!!!I love how you get to draw to people,one for the saver and the other as the trapped one.my person looks horrible but I just keep on playing.I TOTALLY recommend this game.
A0239841MAXD5RC4YPXU B00BJCLUXO 4 1365292800 40 Downloaded this beautiful app for my two small kids, along with the kids doodle apps and I have to say that they are inspiring, and encourages kids to be creative, I really want to encourage parents to download this app.
A02574211ZTWG21TA1NB9 B00BG3ID0Y 5 1366848000 36 This is a GREAT game for adults and kids to play. My grand daughter and I team up to play. I am amazed how quickly she can answer even before I can figure out the word.
A02574211ZTWG21TA1NB9 B00BGC5UAG 5 1361664000 22 This is really a good game to help you think about connecting pictures to produce one central thought.  It is almost addictive!!
A02574211ZTWG21TA1NB9 B00BGAZYLI 5 1363046400 53 I have had so much fun playing this game.  I have actually completed all levels and started over so my 6 year old grand daughter can play the game.  She has become quite an avid player with a little help from her GIGI!!Great for helping to kids to make connections and make predictions.
A02574211ZTWG21TA1NB9 B00B7ERH04 5 1382400000 29 My grand daughters use this to make their own photos when they play dress up with my hats and jewelry.  They really love it because it is to use.
A02574211ZTWG21TA1NB9 B004I744AS 5 1383177600 51 My husband and I use this app to build our vocabulary and to keep our minds Sharpe. We focus on two or three new words each day and use the words repeatedly during the day. We even quiz each other on the previous days' words. Great for couples and singles :-)
A02574211ZTWG21TA1NB9 B00F1RR3Y8 5 1382400000 43 My grand daughters love to take turns &#34;doing their nails&#34;.  I like this game because it allows them to be as creative as they want to be without having a BIG mess to clean up after they finish.  We all love this game.
A0262578SBA1F6LA5RHE B00DJFIMW6 5 1393459200 29 Awesome love this entertaining for the kids as well. Always a fun way to watch the kids play and laugh they live it. So much fun.. would highly recommended.
A02656821OAR4GDOSJA2M B00GY0HJ4K 1 1389484800 36 It is nice that Amazon Coins are offered for a game made too simple til lv 40..... but seriously, I have no coins and while playing....Dumb. i have hade other Wooga games on my device. Smdh
A02656821OAR4GDOSJA2M B00B2TET3C 3 1366416000 24 The game is fun, just wish it was easier to gain coins for power-ups. other than that it's a good game to pass time.
A02656821OAR4GDOSJA2M B00BFUUMO8 1 1381017600 40 The game seems fun at first but then it's money money money. When you finally open the aquatic side, you will not find DNA unless you spend money. I am so sorry that I wasted my time on this game.
A02656821OAR4GDOSJA2M B00IAQ3RJM 5 1397692800 26 As soon as i started playing i was instantly addicted. So much better than candy crush even though cc made improvements. I highly recommend this game.
A02656821OAR4GDOSJA2M B00E8KLWB4 5 1390435200 25 G5 never fails to deliver a great game. The graphics seem flawless and the gameplay is awesome. A must have for your hidden object collection.
A02658263UUAM9CGW5U4S B00D2XD5JU 4 1372377600 41 I just updated game, and now every level I'd previously played, except the first one, is gone! I've been playing for over a month, and now I have to start all over? The coins I had before are still there. Disappointed.
A02658263UUAM9CGW5U4S B00D0VZLVE 4 1370563200 22 Great game, a little hard though! Good graphics, but not easy to figure out answers. I would download more by this developer.
A02658263UUAM9CGW5U4S B00E1GOGJK 4 1383696000 39 Than I thought it would be, but I have a feeling I will be purchasing more coins because I really like this game so far. It's different than the normal guess the picture game. Which is a good thing!
A02874203N3WEYFKEYTTF B00DUGCLY4 3 1403913600 41 This is a fun way to kill a little time. I've only been playing for a couple days but I play maybe once a day. This game does get boring quick however. After about 5 puzzles I'm done for the day.
A02874203N3WEYFKEYTTF B004XQYBA2 1 1394841600 23 I love Sudoko. This game however wouldn't download properly on my Kindle Fire HD. I downloaded it 3 times before I gave up.
A02874203N3WEYFKEYTTF B00EBE8MUG 3 1380412800 25 Good way to waste time. I just started but the broad genre of tv shows featured seems like this will allow for good game play.
A02874203N3WEYFKEYTTF B00CW6DAKC 1 1386806400 50 I love this game...well I loved this game before a update was required on Kindle Fire HD now I can't play. To make matters worse I just spent 300 tokens on game RC the day before. Please fix this so I can update my game and get back to farming.
A03048481FV621E1W2HAT B00ELOOYZI 5 1393200000 43 This is an entertaining game. After you successfully navigate to where you want to go, you can always build crazy rockets or test your aim by trying to hit the moon. No glitches that I could detect, and it has very satisfying explosions.
A03048481FV621E1W2HAT B00B20CMJE 4 1362182400 44 Robo5 is the most entertaining android game I've played yet and has simple yet effective puzzle system that is immediately comprehensible and puts the touch screen to good use. I would highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for a quick but challenging game.
A031039837WA119VJ191B B004VGWOO4 4 1364083200 87 I grew up playing rummy with my grandmother, mother and sisters so when I found this rummy game on my Kindle I got it right away, and I do enjoy it. It is easy to play and offers various degrees of challenge. It is great for passing time and even to play when the TV is on. The game itself is easy to play and it moves right along. There are no pauses/delays in it. I would recommend this game for anyone that is a rummy fan.
A031039837WA119VJ191B B0094BB4TW 3 1353715200 21 The Facebook site is not really easy to navigate from my Kindle Fire....not as user friendly as from my computerVerna Sorensen
A031039837WA119VJ191B B00AVGGYNA 2 1390867200 75 This bingo game has no personality.  You don't play against anyone else.... there are a set number of numbers called....it is hard to get more chips to play with and almost impossible to get power ups...unless, of course, you spend real money on them.  I won't do that unless I am in a real Bingo hall and stand to win a real prize.  There are other Bingo games available that are a lot more fun.
A031039837WA119VJ191B B00CKW6FVE 2 1379808000 30 I am spoiled by the old, original version of Tetris and this is nothing like it.  I just don't like it so removed it from the device and ignore it.
A031039837WA119VJ191B B008FC58ES 4 1363478400 34 I'm new to gin rummy. My daughter got me interested. Right now it is my favorite game on my Kindle. I'm glad there is computer scoring. I haven't quite figured that part out yet.
A031039837WA119VJ191B B00BUR9KJE 4 1379808000 49 I have been a Yahtzee fan for years.  This is not by the original designer, but there isn't much you can do to mess up the game. I like the fact that it is easy to play against the computer... nice way to use up bits of free time.
A03166339FAICWH7X7WG B0076ANQQC 5 1354147200 24 my almost three year old nephew loves this game. he asks to play on my kindle almost everyday, and he plays barnyard games alot.
A03166339FAICWH7X7WG B00AEJPK0C 5 1367193600 23 I love this game it is fun and addictive...I play this game for hours on end until the battery dies on my kindle...
A03166339FAICWH7X7WG B0091REZMW 4 1386892800 20 This game is fun and addictive.. I could play for hours on end or until battery on my kindle dies.
A03271321M5A7N65UWYJU B00CF34B2I 5 1372550400 87 While browsing through the reviews I noticed a few angry costumers complaining about the following reasons:1. The game is too big, takes too much space NO S***!! it is supposed to take that much space otherwise the game would be crap!2. Does not work on the original Kfire, I downloaded it on my Kfire first and it worked like a charm.3. You have to spend money to get cards. Welcome to the real world ladies and gentlemen, this is what you get for downloading a free game.
A03271321M5A7N65UWYJU B00CBJMYKM 5 1369008000 26 Really fun! Overwhelmingly positive and great atmosphere. Cute, challenging, lengthy and overall great game.  My daughter loves it and I also find it very entertaining myself.
A03271321M5A7N65UWYJU B00C2VIA52 1 1372204800 72 I have been playing this game for a while and I loved it!! But just recently the servers have crashed on me. I am frustrated and angry at these shenanigans. Update the servers or else ill keep my one star review and never ever purchase anything at Gameloft ever again. Not only that But ill let my forum find out and have all of my 19000 followers to seize purchases at Gameloft.
A03271321M5A7N65UWYJU B0066T0EVE 5 1359072000 117 AMAZING GAME OVERALL. I WAS DISSAPOINTED TO FIND OUT THAT I ha  passed the game in about an hour. If your going to charge 7 bucks for a game at least make it last longer. Any who there  a glitch with the line gun primary fire, every time it shoots the game temporarily freezes its annoying also when entering zero g areas an  exiting the game occasionally crashes. But overall it's a very good game. And for those  of you whining about the controllers are complete incompetent retards if you can't handle  The  controllers then you shouldn't even be playing videogames in the first place. Please stfu about your incompetence  an  learn to use a modern device.
A03271321M5A7N65UWYJU B008TQ16OG 1 1360972800 67 The game is unable to play via facebook on kindle fire thus not being able to unlock some levels and bikes. Also the ability to send someone a game via sms does not work on kf also what kind of company goes by name topfreegames yet their games are not free? That`s retarded. I will happily change my review to 5 stars if the changes are made
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B004MC8CA2 5 1402876800 65 I don't kniow how many bibles I have downloaded trying to find the right one for me. This is it. It is so much easier to find what I am looking for than most bibles. Most of the time you have to start at the beginning and keep going until you find your answer. This one lets you look up a specific chapter and verse.
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B00CDV6WDS 5 1391558400 24 I LOVE IT I have always liked mahjong and this game is not a disappointment. I really enjoy it whenever I get a chance.
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B004NE3T8Y 4 1395878400 24 While I have only recently purchased this app I can tell already that it is a good app. Easy to use and very secure.
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B0063M22QO 5 1387584000 31 I think Mahjong is one of the best games ever invented and this game is one of the best. I can take it with me and play anytime. Isn't that great.
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B007BH7T90 5 1384646400 25 I love Mahjong but I found this one a very good game. The ease of play is great fun.  I can't get enough of it.
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B00AUXZJAS 5 1387584000 31 WOW How interesting to have a game that also exercises you brain at the same time. I thoroughly enjoy relaxing and playing Mind Games Pro. It never ceases to amaze me.
A0328927TA7ECTIKNP3G B00ET47USI 4 1391558400 20 If you like spider solitaire then you will like this one too. It is easy and fun to play. thanks
A03391331MFHD3H31AEN3 B00BHHIWQO 5 1364083200 37 I was dying for this game to come out for kindle as soon as i saw it i hit download when i started playing it worked perfectly had no problem loging in to Facebook best game ever!
A03391331MFHD3H31AEN3 B008K3OOJM 4 1351987200 18 its realy fun its like having your own fish tankyou get feed them and get fish eggsits great
A03391331MFHD3H31AEN3 B00AAIHGA4 5 1354579200 39 i played a lot of sonic games and this is prity good for a trial verson sure the controls is a litte hard but a lot better than episode 1 i put the full verson on my chrismas list
A03391331MFHD3H31AEN3 B008K8U13K 5 1360454400 57 For starters the kindle version has better graphics then the wii version sonic looks a lot better the controls is a little hard at first but you will get use to it and the gameplay is amazing only thing is it takes a little while to load beside that its an awesome game to download five stars!
A034597326Z83X79S50FI B00E5GJ7QS 3 1376179200 23 I dislike the way they push you connect to Facebook and how they sneakily put the connect button where the no usually is.
A034597326Z83X79S50FI B00F8L2VO4 5 1382572800 77 I've tried a lot of apps to learn French. This one is fun and simple. There are no in app purchase catches. It has a few different styles of questions and though maybe a bit repetitive sometimes it really does teach you.My favorite part is if you do not check in constantly you lose part of your progress. Encouraging you to keep up on your skills.I take it back my most favorite part is the it's free.
A03813301Y69Y742SGMRN B00CMF27DE 4 1369958400 23 If you like bingo you'll love this one. Whether you  like playing with friends or strangers, this is the bingo game for you.
A04023062NO3NP4XHY776 B004MNO0BQ 5 1356998400 20 It proved greater than expected when I bought the game, especially since waiting rooms turn into your cool new playground.
A04050202ZJFCFXE9GMZM B00632HWOG 1 1366848000 56 When  you have a working poduct leave it alone. Don't try tp &#34;improve&#34; it by making it more &#34;viewer friendly&#34;. If the end line consumer is really using the product they will take the time to sign in and use the product as it was originally intended. Shortcuts aren't always what they are advertised to be.
A04050202ZJFCFXE9GMZM B009LQ8X58 4 1387584000 45 Keeps apps defraged increasing access time. I recommend this app if you have multiple apps &amp; books you use a lot. Commends to kindle fire &amp; kindle fire hd. Not sure how it responds to kindle fire hd (maybe Santa Clause will help me out).
A04181383SUZ4PDKLK2RX B009HKL4B8 4 1390176000 24 not a game for someone who has poor eye site,I use a magnifying glass to play,works great. Found a great way to play ..
A04181383SUZ4PDKLK2RX B008B84O6Y 1 1390003200 21 I noticed it sucked my battery dry,even when not being played battery is drained,Had to delete all games from this company.
A04181383SUZ4PDKLK2RX B007PT3QOQ 1 1386547200 40 cause I have spent REAL cash on the game and was very high in level now it crashed and restarted I lost everything I worked to have done,Game stopped responding I am not happy they wont answer my countless e-mails
A042519411OV25M3KQO3L B00BPC23XO 4 1363996800 26 Some of them are hard and some are really easy. Some don't even make sense. But considering its free. It is a fun and addicting game.
A042519411OV25M3KQO3L B0094BB4TW 3 1371340800 44 Ok so it worked about the first few months but now it won't work and it keeps saying facebook has stopped while I'm trying to do things! It's so annoying! Don't get it! Just go on the web for Facebook! Trust me! It's better!!!!!!
A042519411OV25M3KQO3L B004UID2LC 4 1371340800 37 Everyone is saying that it is super bad but it's fine! I downloads my music and stuff and my videos from it and it's fine!!! I don't know what problems people are having but mine is fine!
A042519411OV25M3KQO3L B009UX2YAC 5 1362096000 27 Ok. I will only be honest. It is amazing and fun... I am addicted to it. But it does get glitchy sometimes.. otherwise it is sooo fun!!!!!!
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00FX6ZBXC 4 1405641600 25 Tune up your brain. Use words with high points. Use the Chumbot feature or you will be waiting a long time to play another word.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00CX9P6V4 4 1373932800 32 This game is fun for all. You do sometimes get stuck on a picture, but if you put the game down and go back later you will figure it out.  Have fun.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00DUOO4GE 2 1375747200 24 The game is just OK. Not exciting at all.  There are so many of these games and this one would be close to last.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00BNH1PF8 5 1384128000 24 This game is fun. Some you really have to think. A little brain exercise. After finishing one I look forward to the next one.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00I0WIUHK 5 1392422400 33 Bright quick winning game. It has side games too. So far it's been fun. A lot better then some of the other slot games. Not complicated where you don't even want to play.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00AF09O2A 3 1390262400 22 This game is fun but the red balls rarely come up and the money you start with goes quickly. Choose another game.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00HKF00UI 5 1392422400 34 You have so many ways to earn coins. I just started and already played three extra games in the original game. So far so good and I have tried alot of slot games. Goodluck.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00D5YT6IA 4 1372032000 26 game is quick and fun until you are temporarily stumped. Then you have to think a little harder. Or use your earned coins or buy some.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00975HIYU 4 1373587200 23 Good freebie. You win quickly instead of using most of the money given to you. Nice sound and graphics. Many levels to play.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00L3MNCNQ 5 1405296000 25 Keep your eyes open you don't want to miss anything. Eyeballs go back and forth between the pictures. Little things make it or break it.
A042567820YY2HZSZFJJZ B00COVCV50 5 1371168000 44 Love it. Some of them make you think. Others are a relief to get. Just one issue....can't skip any. You have to guess it or use coins for hints. If you run out of coins you have to buy some to use for hints.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00AJ1S1CY 4 1363046400 30 this game is great for the small kids.they love trying to beat their last score.when the adults get bored-turn it on a faster speed and try to beat your scores.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B006C4U9RW 5 1369872000 23 I haven't used this, but my tweens and teens are always stealing my tablet so they can use it... well worth the price
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B007BSPOG4 5 1388188800 33 I have two teen boys, and they are always talking to some young lady with this app. I don't use it too often,  but it's not like I ever have a chance wither
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00A04F8NU 4 1364428800 50 this game may get old quick for some of us old people-but it is just challenging enough for the tweens, and if they do start to remember where things are or they think it is too easy, there are more difficult settings like by shadow or work instead of picture.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00AEWUQG2 4 1364428800 21 game seems like it should be simple-but no. it is amazing how much I have forgotten over the last few decades.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B008Y7SMQU 3 1363046400 30 i thought i knew all of the logos out there-i don't know many at all. can get frustrating when you know the answer but can't think of it-that's the worst!
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B009UX2YAC 3 1363046400 30 my son downloaded this app-its not my favorite-but my two oldest boys seem to like it, and I'm guessing the makers had their age group in mind from the start.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00B5KHZA2 3 1363046400 26 not bad, but also not challenging.doesn't take long to know where every object is.I guess if you do not play often it will last a while.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00BG3ID0Y 3 1364428800 46 a pretty fun little time passer. some of them are simple and others can stump you for a little while. can be a little addictive-I often have to make myself put it away when I realize I have been playing 3x longer than I had planned.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00632HWOG 5 1369872000 36 this was nice, I was able to look at my email without this app, but once I downloaded this, I was able to import my contacts and folders so it was well worth the free download
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B005ZXWMUS 4 1364428800 57 I can watch whatever I want while my husband is watching Speedtv. There are not many new movies but there are plenty to choose from and once in a while you may be surprised by one. Plus the tv series are always there to choose from, so no matter what you are in the mood for-it's there
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00EBE8MUG 4 1380931200 42 Game is entertaining enough but it is surprising to see how many shows I recognize, a lot of them I have never even watched. I have only been playing a short time, but I think it will be fun for a while
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B0093BM38O 4 1363046400 20 apparently not very. all joking aside, this game is challenging but not so much that the fun is taken away
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B007U7BIO8 4 1363046400 26 i always have my tablet and with this app, i always have an alarm clock.i use it to wake me up, and for reminders-especially when baking
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B009VSW15Y 4 1371168000 58 it is easy to use if you are taking pictures of yourself, but can be difficult to use when you are trying to gt other things since you have to look at the screen to aim and the camera is on that side. However, this is not a reflection of the camera app, it is the device design.
A04307562LMGFZCANFC2P B00AB7HESI 5 1371859200 51 everyone loves it, including all three of my sons who range from age 9 to 15, and I have even found myself playing this game (for hours). It is easy enough for the kids but occasionally makes them think...which they need to do once in a while especially over the summer.
A0432510YRIX4CPKHM10 B008JGSM6G 4 1358640000 40 At first I thought this would be easy but,as I leveled up I found it a challengeto cover the whole board or to link the colors without isolating another. I keepcoming back to this game more and more thank you.
A043656019VIUYGQQ1CX B00CJ77HU8 5 1370131200 31 Just started playing for a few minutes and found myself still at it hours later.Love the sounds and the pace .This is a great game for everyone .and it was free
A043656019VIUYGQQ1CX B0064X7B4A 5 1385596800 20 I am an old woman and I love this and it is so enjoy it .  The nicest people play.
A043656019VIUYGQQ1CX B0052832G4 1 1359504000 26 If you have problems using your hands this is not for you would have been better if I would have thought it thru before purchasing this
A043656019VIUYGQQ1CX B00IAQ3RJM 4 1398384000 28 Lots of fun for adults and children . Graphics are great and you can  play for hours if not careful. Will keep this app for all my devices.
A046006938AM5SST8SS4D B0065AFQSU 4 1361491200 24 keeps me up on scores, great way not to miss anything in the sports world that's going on. great at work for quick updates.
A046006938AM5SST8SS4D B004MC0FO8 4 1361491200 20 great way to get that song you like when you like a song and have no idea who sings it.
A046006938AM5SST8SS4D B00AQ398AY 3 1361491200 28 only had it a short while, but it looks like it check my kindle goodmakes you feel safe a little bit with all the hackers messing things up.
A046006938AM5SST8SS4D B0087FMUCQ 4 1361491200 21 really really fun hard to stop but would be a 5 if you could play a whole 9 or 18 holes.
A04633732DVT5HKT74K1A B00BPC23XO 5 1363996800 22 This is the best 4 pics 1 word game I've played yet its challenging but fun and also easy at some points
A04633732DVT5HKT74K1A B00ANUMR1W 5 1357344000 22 I personally like all glu games, but that's just my opinion I love this game I think it's cool to kill dragons
A04657478EKD8INNW11U B008I43DYU 4 1366761600 31 Being  a sub means being mobile and the less I have to carry the better.  This is a great calculator for my kindle and I use it as much as possible.
A04657478EKD8INNW11U B0064X7FVE 4 1378339200 22 Easy to use.  All you need to know about the weather can be easily accessed.  Easy to swipe from screen to screen.

A0467645A9WB7QX7MFUC B00AIQP9DE 4 1374278400 29 Do not get me wrong the game is great. It is just not long enough. I paid $5 for this game do not think it was worth the money.

A0467645A9WB7QX7MFUC B00998UF9U 3 1380240000 35 It is an ok game I guess. It takes too long for more energy. If you want spend money it will be a great game for you. I enjoy the concept of the meaning free.

A047539528XG24DN3GO6Z B00ELMHHAE 4 1391817600 31 This is so much fun to play  , the only thing is you have to wait and get coins every day. I don't want to buy coins ,when they are from.
A04816858XKO02H7BRNX B00BX736EG 5 1366329600 22 Downloaded this game for free after hearing about it and can't put it down now! Super addicting, great game. Good time waster

A04816858XKO02H7BRNX B00BPC23XO 4 1366156800 25 Good free game, fun time killer with some tricky puzzles. Good for all ages. Not super hard but it gets your brain going a bit!

A04816858XKO02H7BRNX B00DJK2TO8 4 1376265600 42 I just got going on this game after a friend got me curious... I've already beat all the 4 pics 1 word games so I decided to try the 4 pics 1 song. Already loving it!! Not too easy, not too hard.
A04816858XKO02H7BRNX B0097HSS4M 5 1368921600 90 I am having so much fun with the photo editor+ app. I downloaded it right before my little sisters wedding and used it to take pics while we were getting ready, have been using it all morning on the pics I took and having a blast! This app has so many different options and editing tools to choose from and it's completely simple to use! I love being able to do any editing I want then being able to immediately share my pictures! 5 stars for sure on this app!
A04816858XKO02H7BRNX B00B6PO6AI 5 1366502400 23 Absolutely addicting game, fantastic price, and its helping my 14 yr old son with his spelling. Recommend this game for teens and adults!
A049499332VKQ31EB7MV5 B00CWY76CC 3 1384646400 26 A little too easy in the beginning but a few of the rooms were tougher. Requires thinking in a few rooms. Good game for younger folks.
A049499332VKQ31EB7MV5 B00AZZGOWI 5 1377734400 39 Awesome little game. Easily becomes addicting. I find myself looking at things such as flowers in real life and thinking that would look good in my park. I have to play everyday. I highly recommend it for all ages.
A049499332VKQ31EB7MV5 B00IINPXLW 4 1402531200 72 This is a fun game for even adults. Some levels require a little thinking to complete. Some of them I haven't completed yet. I like that you can buy helps/boosters with coins you earn in game. The only thing I don't care for is that I can't find a place in the game to turn down the volume just for the game. I like to listen to music while I play games.
A049499332VKQ31EB7MV5 B009NTJRQM 3 1392249600 29 This is an ok game for children. The step by step tutorial takes a while to complete.I would recommend it to those who have kids 6- 10 yr old.

A05026511FQMVPVJH3KP8 B009L9Z6G4 4 1372118400 21 it's nice to have when wwe isn't on and you can get news you can't get on wwe.com which is nice
A05028313EN3IAX2DFEW3 B00B2W1RSY 3 1395532800 21 Almost sorry paid for this game. I have played it before in the computer and don't remember having this much trouble.
A05028313EN3IAX2DFEW3 B0084DYNGC 3 1396224000 35 I have played this before  on the computer. Not a bad game some story line. But you can't tell if you have found all the beetles or not. Wish they would have thought of that
A05028313EN3IAX2DFEW3 B00IAQ3RJM 5 1401667200 24 Not a bad game. Kind of like candy crush. Increases in difficulty easy enough to do if they give you the items you need.
A050400913ZMMUH4DEFUQ B007L3M1W4 5 1382918400 27 I like it but it freezes a lot and sometimes the makeup doesn't show on the bottom but other than that it is awesome. I recommend it
A050400913ZMMUH4DEFUQ B009ZXT4BY 4 1383436800 25 I like it but like the other people it does need more time to play and should let u play until u don't want to
A050400913ZMMUH4DEFUQ B00GUY712U 5 1394236800 32 I love this game its wonderful you get to care for eggs and hatch them :then they turn into cute animals I love this game L O V E LOVE LOVE LOVE
A050400913ZMMUH4DEFUQ B00998UF9U 5 1397779200 36 this game is awesome you get a boyfriend and you can go shopping you have to get this yams the only downside is it takes forever to download just for a heads up get this game
A050400913ZMMUH4DEFUQ B00H59CTW6 5 1393804800 81 ok I don't know how to start this might not make sense this game is awesome its addicting I got it last night and played till 12 o clock I had to charge kindle this morning because I ran it out of battery playing it you so need this game if you get it you wont be able to get rid of it so unless you don't want to spend hours of your day on this then you should get it
A050410525NGVLSLG72NO B00CO6TOBY 1 1390867200 47 I like the game and enjoy playing ,but I have to wait until I get to work to play . Can't play at work except on lunch break. I can't play at home because of limited exposure to the internet. Maybe I missed something, I don't know.
A050410525NGVLSLG72NO B004SJ3BCI 5 1365033600 22 This is another game that will keep a child entertained for hours if you let them.  especially good for waiting rooms .
A050410525NGVLSLG72NO B0088Y7YHW 2 1365033600 26 Careful about colledting more coins for a free game. I like a game that I can play , put down and then play again. without paying
A050410525NGVLSLG72NO B007TO3JW6 2 1365033600 21 You have to be careful or you'll spend money that you don't know  your spending. A little to risky for me.
A050410525NGVLSLG72NO B004SBS8LA 5 1365033600 24 My grandchildren like this so much I have to limit their time with it. I don't want them to do this and nothing else.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B008KYOCA2 1 1396656000 21 Like CalDAV-sync. Too much setting it up just to use it. All I wanted was a simple calendar not THIS headache.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B004MC8CA2 1 1359331200 34 Got it wasn't what I hoped for, you can't even start reading the bible until you run thru the junk that's on it. not what I expected, still can't even get to my reading.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B008KMAJQU 4 1359331200 20 Sort of difficult to operate on the kindle, gory and very detailed. Fast paced keeps you on your toes. Wild
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00632HWOG 4 1386806400 28 This application work's great got it on my kindle Fire and on my smart phone. Will download it on my laptop. Thanks Yahoo your awesome.Lol Charles and gizmo.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00CB4ET0K 4 1388620800 86 This game is all that and more, love the graphics. If you like to be in the front lines of battle this is your game. I really love to kick ass against the enemy and here you get the chance. Allot of different weapons to use I especially love using the sniper rifle and the anti aircraft gun. Check this game out, if you don't like it just delete it. Simple as that. I don't think you're going to hit the delete button on this game.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00C149WAM 1 1386806400 21 Watch out this application has spyware at least to my kindles security system. Had to remove it. Lol Charles and gizmo.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00INJ2P0S 3 1393804800 41 This is the first game I checked out in this kind of vener. In other words I never played a game like this one. It fun and keeps your attention. Plus it's free. Try it out you might just like it.
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00HY9UK28 4 1392249600 44 This here is something that everyone would enjoy, I made it through the first two songs(my era) but got stuck on the third, I think for those who listen to music no matter what the age will enjoy this application. Lol Charles and Gizmo
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B007VUA7VO 5 1371081600 23 I love it had no problems with it it's a really good application to have. Will recommend this so to all my friends.

A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B008JK6W5K 5 1360627200 65 This game is so awesome, it keeps me going, when I get up in the morning I'm already thinking about the symbol I was stuck on the night before. This application is so addicting and fun to use. Only problem is that I try not to cheat by breaking out my laptop and Googleling for the answer, thanks for this application it's crazy fun. Bestpittbull
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00CH26TL8 4 1373068800 31 But dam when are they going to get candy crush available for Kindle fire? Tired of waiting come on people get your s together. You have something here don't blow it!
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B00701L6TQ 5 1397952000 50 Graphics are amazing, NEVER boreing keeps you on the edge of your seat. I'll recommend this application to all my friends and family. The person or person's who created this application should be proud and also a reward. Please try it out you won't regret it. Lol Charles and Gizmo
A05059033JWCACJUK57F2 B009C7ZQM4 4 1389830400 42 This application is interesting it takes a little time to get used to but it's worth the$, just kidding it's free and probably the best cleaner you could have for the Kindle fire. I'll give it a four and a half rating.
A05066151I27RW7S6YLCS B00B2V66VS 5 1362182400 28 Temple Run 2 is WAY BETTER than the first one. Better graphics and more upgrades and some much new stuff. And FREE!!! You GOT to get this game!!
A05066151I27RW7S6YLCS B00B7AIZOA 5 1369267200 28 The app is really to fun to draw. And it is making me a better digital artist. Highly recommended for all artists, wheather professional or just a hobby.
A0509331D028ORDMIVI6 B009EEFTMC 5 1362009600 78 There is nothing to dislike about this game other than I spend too much time playing.  As my heading says, the pretty colors of the block got me to look at it and then.......all was lost, I purchased it and have been playing ever since.  Also hooked my son-in-law on the game.  Buy it, if you have the time to be lost in the colors and all the many ways to move the block around to find matches!!!
A0509331D028ORDMIVI6 B0064TVQ5E 5 1356480000 38 This is the first time I have played this game and.....I am addicted to it!  This edition seems to be well done and easy to use for a beginner.  I am now looking for more challenging versions.  :-)
A0509331D028ORDMIVI6 B005KC664W 5 1355875200 31 This, too, is a huge favorite of mine and the mechanics of the game on my Kindle are great.  Looking forward to many more happy games trying to beat the numbers....
A05314842GO6XH1MTNJDE B005ZXWMUS 5 1353888000 62 I recommend Netflix often to my friends and coworkers. The only downside to Netflix is having to wait so long on new movies and shows. If you're like me though, and don't have a problem waiting a year to watch a movie then get Netflix. I know that since getting a Netflix account we watch it about 80% of our T.V. time.
A05314842GO6XH1MTNJDE B0094BB4TW 4 1353888000 74 This app starts up quickly, connects to my facebook account simply and works great. I've not used it many times and I'm sure once I'm used to the app I won't have any issues with it. On initial use though I'm not crazy about how it's laid out. Seems like there should be short tutorial on the app itself to show where the buttons and all are located. Other than that it works good.
A05314842GO6XH1MTNJDE B0091REZMW 3 1367798400 29 The game play is fun and the visuals are good but without spending money you run out of energy faster than I would like even for a free game.
A05314842GO6XH1MTNJDE B00FB13Y74 1 1389657600 30 I've uninstalled and reinstalled this app 3 times on my Kindle Fire and can't get passed the title screen. It stops and exits or says can't connect to app store.
A05314842GO6XH1MTNJDE B004MC8CA2 5 1353888000 86 I love love LOVE YouVersion!! If you like to dive into and research God's Word then you will too. One can read the Word in King James Version then compare it in the Amplified or New Living Translations. I also absolutely love the reading plans. The only problem I've come across is that I tend to sign up for too many reading plans on my days off work then can't keep up once I go back to work. This is the best app I've come across.
A05314842GO6XH1MTNJDE B008RA3X5E 5 1359763200 38 This app is much cheaper than a desk clock and works better. I selected my loudest song and use it to wake up every morning. That plus the nightstand feature make this app perfect for what I needed.
A05329602W4LW2X80XGRV B0064DBE9I 2 1371254400 26 It's really boring. All you do is hit the tiny stupid pianoIt's not fun at all. Hate it very much. Little kids might like it more.
A05329602W4LW2X80XGRV B00BFWY2KG 1 1375747200 23 I love it when it actually works. But it crashes so many times I have to're download the game about a million times.
A05329602W4LW2X80XGRV B00D3MWW44 5 1377129600 55 I just love this so much that  I can't stop playing it. First I was playing this on the computer until I realized that it was on my kindle fire. I got it and I just couldn't stop playing it. It was so fun. My advice is that you should get it. It's even free
A0538914FQN6P0ZYCV1U B00ANT4OHS 5 1359331200 38 I love this app it is so fun! I play it everyday. I also like the new car selection  because the first one's car selection wasn't that good. My favorite cars were the muscle and the spy car.
A0538914FQN6P0ZYCV1U B009JNXK88 5 1357344000 23 This is a great game I love to play it and also passes the time when you are in a boring car ride
A05425443IEXN9KJLOCIQ B00BXPQN2K 2 1392854400 56 Love this game only gave it a two because it will only play off the Internet all of a sudden. Read a few reviews on here that say when you get to a higher lvl it stops working properly gets to 100% loaded then goes back to the carousel on my kindel fire. Please fix. Thanks
A05425443IEXN9KJLOCIQ B00BNH1PF8 5 1364083200 25 Fun game I am already stuck but my friends enjoy helping me out. The last few games I played like this were way to easy
A05425443IEXN9KJLOCIQ B00EBQRSTK 5 1380672000 25 I like the bubbly graphics some of the puzzles are repeats of other guess four games I have played. But over all I like it.
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B004LOMB2Q 5 1357948800 33 I use it for college, my medical information, and even use it to save recipes and craft instructions. I have it synced with my pc, my browsers, and  my kindle. I love it
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B00A4O6NMG 3 1385164800 30 Its a cute game but didn't keep my attention long enough to play it very far pass the tutorial. Doesn't mean its not a good game just not for me
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B00AMEFZ72 5 1376870400 40 This game has a really good feel to it. The callers voice does not grate at my nerves at all. Which is the main reasons that I will just dump a bingo game no matter how fun the app is.
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B00FAPF5U0 3 1385164800 36 has limited lives, relays on having to have friends. Got boring before I even got to level 30. I have found other types of games like this one which require nothing but for you to play
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B007KPOZK4 5 1388793600 28 I love the fact that you can play guys or girls. I know a ton of guys that love fashion type games and are always stuck playing females.
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B008XME36E 5 1391817600 34 Thanks to kindle pioglitazone am a free book junkie ! More of the best books I have ever read have been the books I have found threw  newsletters.  This app has way more selections.
A0562528MOJ1AHA7M2ZR B007SYWFRM 5 1385164800 24 Really a fun concept for Ice Age. Whether you watched the movies or not its a good game building your own ice age zoo
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B00B3WD78Q 3 1362873600 46 I was really looking forward to playing this game.  I think it would be a very good game,. but I don't like waiting 60 seconds before the game starts after I elect to play.  Change the wait time and it will be really a great game.
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B009V1E8EI 3 1355097600 24 I find this game a little sluggish.  I will probably remove it from my Kindle Fire.  The objects are a little hard to see.
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B00AF09O2A 3 1365638400 25 If you like to play Keno this is a very good game.  I personally don't care for Keno.  The computer does most of the playing.
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B009KS4XRO 5 1355097600 22 Here again, I love bingo games.  This is a very pleasant game to pass the time.  I usually play it every day.
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B00CZCX2S8 5 1385424000 21 Very enjoyable game.  The bingo part is good even without the monopoly  part.Just a nice comfortable way to pass the time.
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B00ATSAVQG 4 1358208000 38 I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS TYPE OF GAME BEFORE.  I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A SNAP.  WAS I  WRONG.  I HAVEN'T  PLAYED FOR VERY LONG, BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT IS A CHALLENGE.  I REALLY LIKE IT.
A05645781CK8V6Y1DOBE6 B009EEFTMC 5 1361577600 43 This is a good time passer.  It is played by  matching up two like tiles as you would in Mahjong.  The difference being that the cube can be turned any way you want.  It is not a stationary board like Mahjong.  Very interesting.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00AUB8GA0 5 1379376000 25 Great game for children and adults who just want to relax and enjoy the lovely music that accompanies the game.  Easy to use, pleasant pictures/backgrounds.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00631HASU 1 1387670400 20 Just did not like it.  I personally would not recommend this game...it is not for someone who is easily bored.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00AEJM6H2 5 1388707200 23 Fun, fun, fun.  Pleasant music.  Easy to play.  Relaxing and challenging.  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the gem/jewels games.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00EKTCQCC 1 1387670400 32 Not very descriptive.  The front cover is eye candy but goes no further beyond that.  I would not recommend this to anyone...especially if you already nkow your anatomy and physiology.  It's inept.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B008JGSM6G 1 1379462400 35 Not a game to the adult or intellectually minded.  I thought it would be more challenging than it is, it appears to be more designed for small children who are working on their spatial skills.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00768WTXA 4 1380672000 39 Excellent game for children and for adults who just want to relax and not really use their brain.  Music is relaxing and it is fun to locate the objects.  Most pleasant backgrounds as well.  I highly recommend this product.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B007NZV2HK 1 1379376000 36 Not a game for adults...way too easy.  Children may find it a challenge and it would be good for teaching them to spell.  Would not really recommend it for adults who enjoy this type of puzzle.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00EDEMLTW 5 1388880000 23 Pleasantly relaxing.  Has challenges.  Easy to learn to play for all ages.  Highly recommend this game especially to those who like gem games.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B0052OSTOS 4 1387670400 23 Good download.  Music is very nice and relaxation happens.  I would recommend this for anyone who just wants to kick back and &#34;relax.&#34;
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00GH6HTEG 4 1387670400 35 It is okay .. it was a free download so I tried it.  I have been subjected to much better relaxation/hypnosis examples.  I would recommend it for someone who simply wants to relax...it is soothing.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B0097HSS4M 1 1380672000 41 I personally did not care for this product and would not recommend it to anyone.  It's looks are decieving.  It's a good thing it was free, I would have been upset had I paid for it.  I deleted it almost immediately.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B00BF9TU1A 5 1379376000 30 Fun, pleasant backgrounds and music.  Very relaxing game for coming home from a hard day at work.  Kids like it and I would highly recommend it for children.  Most enjoyable.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B007XMV9XK 1 1379376000 20 Not worth the time or money.  Games are ok but I lost interest almost immediately.  Deleted it from my kindle.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B0094BB4TW 5 1382227200 24 The app makes it quite easy yo access your facebook account.  I recommend it, it's extremely nice to have this available on you Kindle.
A057920325KXNAURFLH1F B007EC27QM 5 1382227200 22 This is superb...it makes using a calculator so very easy for those of us who are low-vision.  I highly recommend this purchase.
A06027411RTB0C36Q5KUP B006M4F67A 5 1397088000 25 Graphics are beautiful, love this game.......it is well worth the price....FREE!It appears a lot of work went into this game.I can play this for hours.
A06027411RTB0C36Q5KUP B00HFTHXMC 5 1402012800 20 I am enjoying this game.The graphics are beautiful and the game interesting.It is not difficult to play.Well worth the download.
A06027411RTB0C36Q5KUP B00AEC8UVU 5 1396569600 31 Love this game......beautiful graphics.This game is fun and very easy to play.If you want take your time along with beautiful graphics.This might be the game for you.I highly recommend this game.
A06027411RTB0C36Q5KUP B0067Q4DPE 5 1397865600 21 This game has beautiful graphics.I have found it to be relaxing, love this particular game..... for a freebie it is outstanding.
A06027411RTB0C36Q5KUP B0097GVJWQ 1 1404000000 37 Got pretty far not certain what level but needed to click the boomerang in a HIS and it froze.Could not go any further.Could not find a forum for help.Sorry cannot rate this lower.......I purchased this for nothing.
A06040392DD4RUEKFX1IQ B008YOBYNG 4 1370217600 22 This is a fun game for slots enthusiasts. The pay outs are ok but more levels are needed. Overall good time waster.
A06040392DD4RUEKFX1IQ B008YW5RH2 5 1374710400 38 This by far is the best FREE tennis game. I tried another one some years ago and it doesn't compare. The graphics are cool and so is the play. I can play this all day long. Very fun.
A06040392DD4RUEKFX1IQ B00529IOXO 4 1374019200 46 This app is right on time for me. Now I can keep in touch w/all my relatives and friends. They want me to say more, but what more can I say. If you want to txt from your Kindle get the app. So far so good.
A06040392DD4RUEKFX1IQ B00CK8W77Y 4 1374451200 58 I really love slot games and this one in particular but why does it take so long to get to the next level? Developers if you're reading this shorten the level up time to every 2 instead of 5. I would play this slot game alot more because I'd feel like I'm getting somewhere. Just a suggestion. Thanks.
A06040392DD4RUEKFX1IQ B00BN6K97Y 5 1374796800 29 What can I say, this game is very interesting but fun as well. What do I mean? Download it for yourself and you'll see what I mean. Have fun.
A06040392DD4RUEKFX1IQ B00B5DLSMU 1 1369526400 50 I really tried to hang with this game but I found it to be a bit lame. Why I can't do practice mode on kindle makes no sense, and when I do get a chance play against someone it's always in waiting. Uninstalled. This app could be so much better.
A06074591BRSHTSHU5EMR B00AZKXNPY 3 1386115200 22 This is a fun game but the quality of the picture is lacking.It is a fun game to play, but not compelling.
A06074591BRSHTSHU5EMR B005ZXWMUS 5 1386115200 33 Hey I just watched a movie on my Kendal.  It never glitched out once.  It also used very little battery to watch a 2 hr film.It is easy to set up and use.
A06074591BRSHTSHU5EMR B00BYJ6BUO 3 1391990400 28 We winter in Mexico and wanted this ap to be able to watch ABC news and keep up with the current events,However it is blocked in Mexico.Oh well?
A06074591BRSHTSHU5EMR B004XDYJRU 5 1360022400 39 We are really enjoying the endless choices of music on our Kindle!  We are living out of the country for the winter and this is the perfect way to hear the music that you like anywhere in the world.

A06312072UHJNVM44YUVZ B0094BB4TW 5 1353974400 22 I have a lot of down time at work , it keeps me from being bored. I love using my nexflix also.
A06312072UHJNVM44YUVZ B005ZXWMUS 5 1352073600 21 Love it when I am at work.  I have a lot of down time and I get to watch my shows.
A06312072UHJNVM44YUVZ B008N3TLNI 5 1360281600 28 I love it cause when you have a short time to play you can continue playing it and it can be done in a short amount of time.
A06312072UHJNVM44YUVZ B007BUETY0 3 1360368000 23 It is a cute game when nothing else will load. just wish there were other games for hidden items that are on facebook.
A06312072UHJNVM44YUVZ B00A04F8NU 1 1360368000 25 it is a very boring game, it is more for little kids.  I can see why it is free. I wouldn't recomend it to adults.
A063522339EWTKQNO3P3M B007CK1MEY 5 1380758400 23 I love this game, and it has beautiful graphics too..a must for kindle fire, you wont be let down if you get this
A063522339EWTKQNO3P3M B00FCYEZOQ 5 1388707200 29 I really enjoyed playing this game. I loved guessing the names,and the ease of playing it. It was also so nice to play it on my kindle fire HD.
A063522339EWTKQNO3P3M B007FJFDXS 5 1380758400 43 I haven't found an app this good in a while, and I have to say its very very fun, great graphics and keeps you on edge! I cannot put it down its addicting too! I love it and 5 stars is well deserved
A064321025DSGTER7QDIX B00529IOXO 5 1351382400 97 I enjoy using this to talk to my friends and family and it works great, but it doesn't show notifications on the kindle fire HD, which usually makes me ignore who ever I was talking to. Itd be great if the person who made the app fixed that.**edit.The app had an update which changed the layout and such. They also added pop up notifications for each text. You'll never miss a text. Even if you're in another app. It will let you either reply quickly  with the popup or go to the app and reply from there.
A064321025DSGTER7QDIX B004H6WTJI 5 1352160000 29 I use this pretty much every day. I never forget to use it, (i have trouble remembering to do things) its quick, and its easy to use. Very helpful.
A064321025DSGTER7QDIX B006U0Y07I 3 1350950400 27 it's quite fun, but it's way too easy to beat. i completed both the classic version and relaxed version within the first five minutes of downloading it.
A064321025DSGTER7QDIX B00AA0TJO8 5 1356998400 48 I got this while it was free for the day and it was a very great choice. And if you're thinking about buying it, you should.It's very fun, very challenging and its very creative. And if you get stuck, you can ask the creators and they'll help you.
A06434888C0UUYMRCGY8 B00998UF9U 4 1364601600 20 I, personally, find this game enjoyable. I have, really, nothing to say against the game. You should play this game.
A06434888C0UUYMRCGY8 B00D9SC4TA 5 1378512000 23 This game is way better than other games like this. I'd say this game comes out at the top. I suggest getting it.
A06434888C0UUYMRCGY8 B00AJ8SRFI 5 1356220800 20 I like this fun app. It is enjoyable and fun. I enjoy playing fashion games. You should get this game
A06434888C0UUYMRCGY8 B008MM9630 4 1372896000 32 This game is pretty fun. I find it enjoyable. The only problem i have, is that gems are hard to get, then you have to buy them if you want a lot.
A06434888C0UUYMRCGY8 B008CG839O 5 1356220800 21 This game is fun. Perfect for any fashion loving girls. I think you should get it if you like fashion games.
A06434888C0UUYMRCGY8 B00AK0DFDY 5 1356220800 19 Think its good i like it can get locked items if you post a reviewI like it a lot
A0651747TFRIVA6RJNCP B00AHUEUGS 5 1360368000 21 it is a very good game for a mystery and it is also free and that makes the game even better
A0651747TFRIVA6RJNCP B0094J0J18 5 1363996800 20 one of the best gladiator fighting game ever because it has alot of blood and good gameplay and graphics to

A0658272NY9NHHJBSGN0 B00ANGMT0U 4 1360800000 22 This game is entertaining and fun. It doesn't take up allot of time so it fits into my spar we time well.
A0658272NY9NHHJBSGN0 B008K6SYX6 4 1392508800 29 The game was engaging.  It kept my interest. It moved quickly and I enjoyed playing it. Hope to find simular games and am looking forward to the second one.
A0658272NY9NHHJBSGN0 B00CAW96DI 5 1373414400 22 This game makes you think. It is not so hard that you can not play it, but challenging enough to be fun.
A0665108GVKV4UECE4LI B00IYOACQ6 5 1396396800 24 This game makes you think. Keeps you wanting to play more and move onto the next level. Great Game.. Will play more like this
A0665108GVKV4UECE4LI B009WJNXAE 4 1387497600 38 I tried to do an update on my kindle fire but it won't update. I notice the rooms are different from my kindle to my phone. Kindle is slower to get updates but I still love playing it..
A0665108GVKV4UECE4LI B00AEC8UVU 5 1364688000 31 I am hooked on this game. You can play different ways which makes the game a lot of fun.. I have created different names so I can play a different way.
A0665108GVKV4UECE4LI B007BUETY0 3 1364688000 21 This was a okay for me. It will be perfect for kids.. I solved the puzzles quickly.. Great pictures of flowers..
A0665108GVKV4UECE4LI B00KQHVWWC 5 1403827200 28 I like that there is different casinos that you can visit and getting the extra spins when you come back everyday. Will be playing this game a lot.
A06771161RYAIST7GMX28 B00E994GPI 5 1381276800 27 People don't rate this app badly because Amazon isn't updating this app! It a great app and it deserves 500 stars! Please listen to me! Thanks, NMS
A06771161RYAIST7GMX28 B007C8DXQQ 3 1362787200 25 It's like wheel of fortune but it's cheesy.It is sort of fun. This app is average, but they coppied wheel of fortune.They should be sued.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B0063IH60K 5 1392854400 38 I got this game soon after getting my Kindle fire 15 mon. ago and I am very happy with it. Because it was free I have to deal with pop-ups and adds.  I play this game every day.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B0093QQCGI 2 1392854400 37 I did not use this app very much and eventually deleted it from my kindle. The app worked well but I gave it only 2 stars because I felt the network leans too far left.  Piers Morgan
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B007OX6DIY 1 1386892800 21 Could not get the game to behave.  Controls hard to manage.  Could not even get started past first part.  Deleted out
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00CAM8YL8 4 1391558400 27 This is very relaxing to listen to.  I don't know if it will hypnotize me or not. Used it once so far and it sure relaxes me.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00EOUGFNS 3 1394323200 28 I am looking for an app that provides me with fast and easy scores to the teams that I follow. This Has to much stuff, I don't need.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B009C7JS14 3 1364947200 24 I found a better one.  After examining this program did not suit my needs.  Found a different program that had features I liked more
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B004TBM4VY 4 1366243200 21 I do not do crosswords normally, but i wanted something to exercise a few brain cells.  I like this crossword game.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00AF6MF9I 2 1392854400 33 I was looking for something different than how this game plays. It was free for my kindle fire so I tried it with no real regrets. I deleted it after playing it twice.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B004TI2ZXY 4 1361145600 34 I have this in my Kindle and works very well.  Simple to use and is what I wanted.  I have a TOMTOM but I wanted something like an atlas and this works for me.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B0065AFQSU 4 1386892800 21 When I need some scores from games I cannot watch. this helps me.esentation is good and not too hard to use.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00BXPQN2K 2 1395705600 22 Tried this game for a while. This is more for younger people or children. It takes time to remember all the options.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00FS0VUWO 4 1392768000 28 Very simple to use on my kindle fire. Since it was free I did not expect much, but it is entertaining.  Not many options unless you buy them.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B0094BB4TW 3 1395705600 20 I really like Facebook better on a computer. This app condenses everything. But it works well  to check on messaging.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B004SBQGHS 5 1392854400 22 this game is one of the first games I down loaded to my Kindle fire. I play this game all the time.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B009VSW15Y 5 1366502400 62 I have a kindle 7&#34; fire HD, and it does come with a camera.  But this app allows me to use a timer feature.  By using this feature I set the kindle in it's folding case/stand and compose the picture I want. I then click the timed shutter and get out of the way, or pose myself in the picture I want.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B006DJ2JSI 2 1392249600 28 This program was too hard for me to use.  I mostly want correct spelling for words and this was to hard to locate my words fast and easy.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B004GMT14Y 4 1392249600 20 I wanted a program to locate misspelled words for correct spellings easy for me. This works better than the Webster.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00GH4YC34 3 1392854400 33 I put the head phones on and enjoyed the very relaxing audio program. I have my doubts wether this can actually hypnotize someone. I did doze off the first time I used it.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B008DYK0I2 2 1394323200 28 I am looking for an app that provides fast and easy access to scores. I only follow a few teams. This app is all about video, playback, etc.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B008D29K7G 5 1384300800 24 Even with the small screen and format it lets me choose several different news items on different pages. Scrolling through seems quick and easy.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B0061S5NNO 3 1381536000 24 Tried using this app for acouple days and canceled it.  I found there was not enough help in determining caleries in home made foods
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B004H6WTJI 5 1367539200 116 I like this diet helper. The guide for finding foods and their calorie content is really helpful. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because it is less than easy to add foods to meals.  After every food you list you have to go back to the page where the meals are, lunch, dinner,etc.  So if I have 3 different things for breakfast, I have to return to the Breakfast listing 3 times to add foods.  Otherwise a great tool for me. June 23. As I use this it has become more friendly, and there is multiple food listings for meals.  I have lost 15 lbs. so far and I am Changing to 5 stars.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B004TTY694 4 1381536000 30 I like using this on my Kindle fire hd my trips and reminders for the many images I take with my camera. Where and what.  Also I keep trip info.
A0698182HBSA2D2MEX40 B00CGPPMKU 4 1381536000 32 Makes interesting shapes and colors.  On my kindle fire I doodle away some minutes while waiting or traveling.  And if you're good at it, the image can be saved for use elsewhere
A071355228O3RUFFKDK4A B007U7IKVM 5 1359158400 20 This is a great gun app. It simulate s how guns can work and it is fun to play with.
A071355228O3RUFFKDK4A B00ATDOVNK 5 1359504000 20 This is a great hidden objects game. The puzzles provide a challenge and the story is thrilling as it unfolds.
A071355228O3RUFFKDK4A B008DGDK64 5 1372291200 27 This is a great gun simulator. It's fun just to load up the gun and fire it. The realistic sounds and graphics make the guns life like.
A0726851LE6YEJK0LM9L B00DR91028 5 1378166400 20 Best game ever!! Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Will play this again. Any more games like this?

A07305593IWIWUBQUZ288 B004H6WTJI 5 1387670400 46 I love this app. Tracking is easy and there's tons of already listed convenience foods and brand name foods etc.One of the best sections is the recipe builder where you can put in your own recipe and it figures the calories and other nutrients for you.
A07305593IWIWUBQUZ288 B00CZCX2S8 4 1391385600 34 Reading some of the other reviews I was pleasantly surprised with the game. I did have a slow start at first but has worked fine since. If you like Monopoly you'll enjoy this one.
A07309331N0PGRTUBL55P B00BOW41P8 5 1397088000 20 I like to read the NY Times periodically and on my Kindle Fire HD, it is a pleasure.  Great newspaper.
A07309331N0PGRTUBL55P B00C5J4MO4 3 1378166400 25 My husband like the challenge of this game.  I think he has some fun with it but becomes agitated when he can't make the putt.
A07309331N0PGRTUBL55P B00BHHIWQO 5 1378166400 47 I absolutely love Diamond Dash.  I play on facebook everyday.  This game is a challenge to see how many gems you can destroy in 60 seconds.  I play with a few friends and we send each other &#34;lives&#34; as you need a supply of &#34;lives&#34; to play.
A07343812QLONJZ8QB5N7 B00BGDEK9C 5 1367020800 64 I almost didn't get this game cause most bowling games are so fake but this one is awesome I loved it immediately I don't Evan bowl in real life id rather play basket ball or base ball but this bowling game is better than them any day get it it's free and if you ask me it should be 12 * not a 5*
A07343812QLONJZ8QB5N7 B00BQPEIT2 5 1385510400 23 Ok I might have exaggerated a little bit but it is truly amazing I love it if you ask me it's worth 5$

A07347751OS3V85PQ4PGK B008JK6W5K 5 1373241600 22 I found logo quiz to be a very entertaining yet challenging way to pass the time, and would recommend this to anyone
A07347751OS3V85PQ4PGK B004HXHVZ8 2 1397779200 20 This app is okay the movies are very expensive and are not very cheap. I do not recommend this app.
A07347751OS3V85PQ4PGK B00EBFKPAA 5 1376697600 24 This game is a game that challenges you against your musical knowledge. You see how many songs you know with 4 pics 1song quiz
A07348714K5XNTY4W1Q5 B0063IH60K 5 1396742400 78 I like this game. It passes time and you start to get addicted. I like to listen to music while playing this. Its a good combination. This game also opens your eyes to spot key things from your earlier mistake. You are not timed but it shows how much time you took to show your score. Its is a good game. Plus its FREE! You should get it. You can always delete it if its not for you.
A07348714K5XNTY4W1Q5 B00ED4TX2A 5 1380067200 24 its soo fun and u really can get skulls for free! :) and its like the game never ends.  you should totally get it!

A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B008N3TLNI 4 1353196800 40 I had this on my phone so when I got my kindle fire I had to try it.... I absolutly love this game. So far no issues at all BONUS!!!!! Get this and play it, you will be addicted too.
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00FZK2S5U 1 1391040000 28 Maybe good for kids but not for anybody above a beginner. I don't enjoy lessons from only one angle as is but this is is barely a lesson.
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B007PT3QOQ 3 1356739200 33 This game reminds me a lot of the farming type games on facebook. It is a nice to pass some time. I have had no problems with it though.No complaints it was free
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00ATDOVNK 5 1357948800 41 Ok so this is a very interesting game. The graphics are nice and I have had no problems so far. I enjoy the puzzles after I played ten minutes I knew I would buy it. I did and I am glad!!
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00G9EZ448 4 1384473600 62 I Have been waiting impatiently for this app. I got it on my KFHD it downloaded fine no problems at all so far! It needs to be able to play other players randomly online. Other then that I have now found my new FAVORITE app! I will give it 5 stars as soon as that is fixed.Thanks for finally getting us SKIP-BO!!!!
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00BHEUT0E 4 1365465600 63 I love skip bo so until they can get that going I play this :) it is a good game worth 1.99 it would be so much better if I could play against another human. The computer doesn't always make the best moves for itself. However it is competitive so there is some challenges. If you like skip-bo you should like this game.
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00ET0PZDO 4 1389657600 27 Very addicting, fun I would recommend this game to puzzle lovers. some levels are harder then others but that is what makes it great. Have fun :)
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B0054JZC6E 3 1353283200 47 I have had no real issues with this app. Some of the games are kinda silly but all in all I am still wasting my spare time playing on it. As long as it is free go for it. I would not pay for this one though.
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00B2TET3C 5 1361836800 45 I have this on my kindle fire hd and I love it. I have been a Blitzer for years now and I can finally play another bingo game that is better.this is an awesome game. I highly recommended this game. 5 stars all the way
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00CZDSK7K 3 1373500800 46 I am on my second generation and my adults died my kids are at college. All I can do now is feed the pets. Been almost 2 weeks and I am growing bored now. How can I bring the kids home?  I already skipped 4 years.
A07432233RGSKVLKZTDUU B00CMF27DE 5 1402272000 68 I am a huge lover of bingo and tried most games. Only a few do I keep. Bingo cats was one of them.  Pretty basic as far as bingo games go. It makes you wait  for more bingo credits to play. But generous enough to not be annoying.I have been playing it on my kindle fire HD for about a year with no issues. Overall I love it.
A07468031TEPSU4NVXE90 B00HDRTGDK 4 1393459200 21 This has been loads of FUN and has broughtBack many memories. Hope you have as much fun playing as I have.

A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B00HCU7OCI 5 1404864000 56 Great game to play! Grand Theft Auto is the one of the best games around. The Kindle version is not as good as the PS2 version.

A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B008D29K7G 5 1386374400 21 Great Network! Always trustful news to read from. Easy to navigate website. Use this app almost every day. A must download!
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B008TY8PKG 5 1386720000 30 Phineas and Ferb game that will have you going Where's Perry? Great for kids to play and enjoy other some other games that teach nothing at all. Good for learning!
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B004S3MB2U 5 1396656000 30 It is a calculator. Has several special buttons that most calculators do not have. Good for any math classes no matter what the subject. Cheaper option over most advanced calculators.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B00B2V66VS 5 1386720000 31 Keeps you focused. Many new twist that Temple Run does not have. This game will have on the edge of your chair and keeping you entrained for hours at a time!

A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B008MEM24S 5 1388188800 27 Got this as free app of the game. What a game. Really makes you think. Some levels have some real twist and makes you work really hard.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B00AQ5A88S 5 1388966400 29 Great way to waste time and learn simple methods to get the most points and prizes while losing very little. Just like the other Coin Dozer but with seasons.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B008Y2FRFO 5 1386633600 38 Fun and helps pass the time! Prizes pop up frequently and challenge you to try to get them down the slot at the end and not let it fall off the sides! Great game to test your mind!

A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B006P4FBUE 5 1397520000 71 Its no Big Piano but it is a great step to learning if you do not have a piano in the house. There are several songs you can watch be played and try to play along with it. Good app for training or keeping your skills tuned. You can have the piano sound like other instruments like violin, cello, choir and much more. Great way to make the time pass quickly.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B0064X7FVE 5 1386374400 32 Ever since I was 6 I have watched this channel every morning and night. Great to know what the weather will be like for the morning and knowing how to get dressed.

A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B008K6G8CK 5 1386633600 34 Several games to play when you run out of coins in one game. The bingo game is realistic, you don't always win. With the amount of games to play you will never get bored.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B004SOR4H6 5 1386374400 33 Love to use this app. 140 characters or less to state your option. Good to talk about many issues from Breakfast to Immigration. Can even use it ti share pictures of your food.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B008NCUFYS 3 1386633600 63 I know you need ads to make money but almost every other ball I drop 1,2 sometimes 3 ads in a row! This game is fun. The game needs a way to buy something to get rid of the green and purple slime that comes around way to often and reduces your scores and multiplier. But like the other reviews say SO ADDICTING!
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B0094BB4TW 5 1386374400 34 It is Facebook. I use it to see whats going on and what people post and what companies post to. Great way to share many things like food, politics and mutual likes and dislikes.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B005ZFOOE8 5 1386720000 29 Listen to almost any station you want or make your own radio station to listen to. I use it when my radio doesn't work or if I'm at school.
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B00AESN8XY 5 1404864000 67 Great Strategy Game to play! So many ways to play and win. Start off low key and infectious to spread to other areas. Game is a great way to kill time and have fun at the same time. I would recommended this game to everyone to play! Downside, even with full immunity, the plague can still be killed by a cure. Even with that 5 star game!
A0759107CA9MPWVRF6VN B004EFYZ1C 5 1397520000 44 Great app for someone who wants to learn about the moon phases. You can move the shadow of the moon to see when the full moon or new moon will happen. It is a great app to teach kids about something educational in life.
A07706491MTIOA2AT7P8N B00E8KLWB4 4 1401062400 20 I'm just doing this for the qust. This is not a bad game. Don't know what else to put here
A07706491MTIOA2AT7P8N B009C7ZQM4 5 1393632000 25 This is the best way I have found to close out my running apps on my kindle. So that's why I gave it 5 stars.
A07706491MTIOA2AT7P8N B00B116U0G 4 1360972800 28 This little game is fun to kill time with. My two kids like to play it they have fun with it and fight to see who playing next.
A07706491MTIOA2AT7P8N B00A3NQNUU 5 1356652800 22 This is a fun little game. It's good to pass time with. You don't really have to spend any money on it
A07708413PNNF6PZTY09T B008Y2FRFO 4 1354320000 25 Good game but sometimes it just goes too too slow!  But 4 the most part very additive. Just wish there were more coins n prizes.....
A07708413PNNF6PZTY09T B008K6G8CK 5 1381363200 47 These are some of the best games that I have played. My favorite one is Video Bingo, but I don't have one that I can say that I dislike either. I can play them for hours at a time and not get bored.  I think I'm addicted!!!!!
A07708413PNNF6PZTY09T B007TO3JW6 4 1352419200 70 This game is lots of fun, seems like u just get started n then u look at the clock n poof....its an hour or two later!!!!Can get a bit boring at times too, but not enough to make u want to stop playing for good. Its more the sound that gets to ya, so I just turn it off n pop in my own n I'm ready for round 2.......
A07708413PNNF6PZTY09T B00CLVQ8GG 5 1373155200 24 GREAT game. Very addictive. I lose track of time playing. But the best thing about the game is it doesn't require money to play.
A07713732CU094H5SNMAO B00CKW6FVE 4 1370908800 84 A plus side to this version of Tetris is that each game is only two minutes long which is good if you only have a few minutes to waste.  It's also a downside because you think &#34;oh, I'll only play a game or two&#34; then the next thing you know 30 minutes have gone by.  I also really liked the tutorial at the beginning.  It helped explain the game much quicker than I would have been able to figure it out on my own.
A07713732CU094H5SNMAO B00A4EZ3QS 2 1365638400 23 I'm not sure what I was expecting with this game, but it got very boring to me very soon after I downloaded it.
A077261335SQT33J2BURO B00DYY92MG 5 1377820800 21 This game has me and my family entertained through family trip or just when we are hanging out.We love this game.
A077261335SQT33J2BURO B008GU42KK 5 1389484800 21 I can't stop playing. Love the story and the adventure along with it. My kids wants to see the next scene.

A07726653LG70P6FGTGTM B009ZKSPDK 3 1364688000 42 The stupid upgrade deleted all my world's. I demand a refund and I was happy with the game but when the upgrade for my kindle came it deleted all my games and deleted all of my world's on both this and Minecraft
A077305333KJQU269HMGG B00785P2QC 5 1381276800 29 I can't put it down just have to make my town bigger larger the way I want it, about to go play it now since I talked about it!!!
A077305333KJQU269HMGG B00CKW6FVE 4 1403136000 39 Its a great game to kill time with but just wish I could earn more money off my bonus instead of $400 or 800 take all day just trying to come up with $3k or 4,500 to buy perks...

A0786784PVVJBSV7Q8FG B00FAX6XQC 5 1381363200 32 THIS GAME SHOULD COME WITH A WARNING LABEL __&quot;VERY HARD TO STOP PLAYING&quot;! I HAVE 2 OTHER HUNTING GAMES AND THIS GAME IS BY FAR  BEST. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S  FREE!
A0786784PVVJBSV7Q8FG B00ATPVA78 5 1402876800 20 GREAT and fun&iexcl;!&iexcl; A little hard but that's what makes it interesting game to play. Now back to the game.
A07881463JOISQ3PFQJOL B00AZPAI6Q 3 1387497600 33 It would be better if the computer could play you in case you don't have any players I invited people and a stranger played twice but a game could take forever that way
A07881463JOISQ3PFQJOL B00BMK357W 4 1384819200 21 Need a chance to buy dollars with coinsThank you game is fun I will play it daily, and tell others too
A0800650K9E0OG0LGH1C B00COVCV50 5 1371427200 20 it seems like this would be really easy but it gets quite hard. but it is fun and time consuming.
A0800650K9E0OG0LGH1C B008Y7SMQU 5 1371427200 20 it's pretty hard but really fun I like it because it's symbols that you have to name I love it
A0800650K9E0OG0LGH1C B00AFCEIB0 5 1369785600 22 I love google so so much it's a very good app to ever have I love to do games a hole lot
A0800650K9E0OG0LGH1C B006OCM0G0 5 1383350400 33 I LOVE IT! because its like my nana's cafe world game witch i wanted to play.Its awesome.You'll want this app because if you had the money for it you would wantto spend it.
A0808318VZBJCYSIAFL5 B009ZXT4BY 1 1363910400 27 This app stinks who would buy an app that you can only play for less than ten minutes I mean it's just a waste of your time
A0808318VZBJCYSIAFL5 B00AXKPWSM 1 1375660800 34 When I got this it came with 3 disturbing inappropriate videos.Also you can't upload videos to you tube.And the videos could have viruses and it tried to save it into my files.Do not get.
A0808318VZBJCYSIAFL5 B00B2V66VS 5 1360454400 56 Me I love the original temple run. Once this came out I got it. I think it's a lot better then the first. I like how you can go through the mines and the ziplineing at the begginng .The graphics are just like Wow. So if you like the first one I highly recommend this app.
A0808318VZBJCYSIAFL5 B00AEORXR0 3 1360454400 49 This app is great and all just it could be a lot better. Personally I play the website.YouTube does not always work. I doesn't even have art books movies or chat room.The only things that I mostly like about it is the game and chatting with friends. It's Ok.
A0808318VZBJCYSIAFL5 B00AB7HESI 1 1373414400 28 It doesn't let me literally do anything but stare at it and I can't type I something and have it show up like this app says it can
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B00A8SPNYW 5 1366761600 24 This game can be rather addicting!  I enjoyed it and played it quite a bit.  Really good at keeping the kids occupied as well.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B0094BB4TW 4 1390176000 31 It's not an overall bad program for the Kindle fire.  I wish it had a little more but it at least gets you on Facebook and able to navigate through it.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B008IBIJTM 2 1369526400 21 I'm just not impressed with this program.  I just feel that there are better programs out there that can be used.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B00529IOXO 4 1358208000 67 Like it has said, it's a free texting program.  Excellent to use I just wish it would chime or something on the Kindle fire when you receive a text.  Although I thought I had it set it still doesn't chime for me so when my Kindle is off and someone texts me I have no idea that I have that text till I turn on the program.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B006R8C4U8 5 1377993600 39 This program is great for us new Catholics. Being new to Catholicism I have had difficulties following Mass. This program helps me learn it and has a list of some Saints and prayers as well as updated Catholic news.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B008BJQCCM 5 1366761600 26 This game is very addictive!!!  I spent quite a while playing it and once I beat it I erased it so I can play it again.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B00632HWOG 5 1358208000 22 I really like this email program and use it all the time.  I prefer using this program instead of using a computer.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B007KQ6XYY 5 1373241600 20 Seems to work well on the Kindle and me and my youngest daughter seem to have fun while playing it.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B0051UP5NQ 5 1358208000 55 I utilize this program a LOT.  Easily to transfer from your computer to your Kindle and use the files you have.  I use the excel program of this especially.  It doesn't have as many features as an Excel program on a computer but it's got a few that are helpful.  Great for us novice users.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B004SRPXWQ 5 1366761600 26 My youngest daughter absolutely loves this!!!  Keeps her occupied for a really long time.  It's funny listening to this and the kids will certainly be entertained.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B004TTY694 5 1358208000 36 I really like this program.  Gives you the ability to use an email program on your kindle if you have one to email whatever you have written.  I use this program a lot to keep stuff.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B008M721MS 3 1373241600 39 This program goes in spurts where it works like a champ with absolutely no problems then all of a sudden it's like the bottom fell out and I have nothing but problems and it wont work on my kindle.
A08334882RHZ3H81NOFS B00D0BTAY8 4 1376956800 24 I can't really complain about this program.  It does like it's suppose to and doesn't seem to have any problems running with Kindle Fire.
A083480223IW4FMZ5PIV9 B004UNX1LS 5 1394064000 26 I am so happy to find a station with videos in it. and Free is my cup of tea....Thanx y'all for the good things you do.
A083480223IW4FMZ5PIV9 B00B7Y0206 1 1394064000 50 I would love to understand my multi-media Kindle and I did try a few times to download music videos. It played well for about 15 minutes then it quit. I just don't comprehend electronics well so if you can please help me because I love to watch videos?  Thank you
A0836388JVJMVZDNTU48 B009WJNXAE 1 1397174400 25 The app won't delete please get off my device! To many adds even for a free app. I do have that right so please leave
A0836388JVJMVZDNTU48 B00BM8UNUQ 5 1370649600 29 I love that it makes servicing a hotel look fun and challenging. Keeps me busy when I'm bored. Also Also it's not complicated with a while lot of steps.
A0836388JVJMVZDNTU48 B009PSV1HE 5 1373328000 24 If Flo can handle the stress of a diner by her self always with a smile lol why can't I she is too cute.
A0836388JVJMVZDNTU48 B00HX49SM2 5 1403654400 21 I love anything Emily! hope you keep inventing Emily situations, life and story lines! I find myself only playing Emily games
A084701058SY9BLR0L6P B00DG8N78A 5 1388188800 20 My husband loves playing this slot game. super fun!! Highly reccomended!!! Pay out is really good and never boring. :)
A084701058SY9BLR0L6P B008XG1X18 5 1397347200 48 I love Pinterest, I have had my account for two years and look forward to getting every day. My daughter even has an account now. I have tried a lot of tips, tricks and recipes off of pinterest. I don't know what I would do without it! &#9829;
A084701058SY9BLR0L6P B00GTXFOIA 5 1389398400 29 Love this game! Nice pay outs and lots of extra bonus's and games. I can tell this is going to be an easy game to get addicted too. :)
A085413315558ASW12KIG B007PT3QOQ 3 1359158400 25 I am just getting into it...I like it but don't like to put real money into it..trying to figure out how not to do that...
A085413315558ASW12KIG B004SUWR2C 5 1359158400 24 another good game, however, have to figure out how I can use it without being connected to internet..I think you have to download it...
A085413315558ASW12KIG B0066T8OH0 5 1359158400 22 I have always loved tetris...have never had the game but now have it at my fingertips...I have even play without being online!
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B00AF09O2A 4 1358467200 21 Cool game I like it. Not spectacular but good basic fun. I like the casino keno Bette  but this will do
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B004VMY62Q 4 1358899200 215 I like this app a lot I just wish that it had a way to lock in specific tabs of my own. it automatically resets back to default tabs everyone you close it so each time you have to go through multiple folders to get to something like when uploading a pic Ihave  to go through multiple folders to get to my shared folder I tried  adding my shared folder to my favorites to make it easier but when I tried to click on it to open it from my favorites to upload a pic it tried to upload the whole shared folder and so to access the individual photos from that point I have to press and hold on the shared folder click more options and then click open in New tab to view  content. wouldn't be so bad if that tab could remain openbecause  when uploading several its very frustrating to have to do so many steps just to upload one pic at a time. I had the file explorer app before this one and I like this one better except with file explorer it allowed me to set anything as my main page so if this asp would allow me to set my own tabs it would be 5stars all the way
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B008K6G8CK 3 1358899200 111 I absolutely love this app, so much in fact that it's the only app I actuallyBUY more coins in and that's the only problem. everytime I buy more coins in shows me an error that says I need  to download the app again from the Amazon app store and I HAVE  done that but when the coins don't show up I'll click to buy coins an  it for  through fine the second time but I get charge  for both the second one AN  the first one that errored which I'm not happy about. please fix. I love  this app but it's very irritating to get charged for coins I don't receive.
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B00AEWUQG2 5 1358899200 36 love this game it's .  lot of fun when bored or stuck in a waiting room. my boyfriend and I love to play it together it's a blast I'd give it ten stars if I coukd
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B006YC74E8 5 1358899200 70 I use this app ALL THE TIME to edit photos. it's the best one to use for the kindle fire hd that I've come across so far an  trust me I've tried  TOO MANY of the Photoshop apps lol this one is hands down the best app it's incredible that it's free!  I've paid  for quite a few  of the cheaper photoshop apps and they don't compare  to this one.
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B006ID7U4C 4 1358899200 47 I like this app quit  bit. just wish it has one area where each card is easily explained for beginners instead of having to switch to different  tabs per car  to figure out position an  meaning and  sometimes the  meaning is confusing but overall I like it
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B008ZOHCKE 5 1358899200 38 No complaints with this app it works really well on my kindle fire hd just wish there were more designs for covers and I wish the lock feature had a way to recover password if you forget it.
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B008BTX2CA 4 1358899200 75 it's the one app that you can really tell the difference it makes. it really boosts the volume when I'm watching a movie or listening to music. if I'm using the speakers for anything on my kindle I make sure to use this to boost sound each and every time. LOVE IT just wish there was a way to have it be open an  controlled in my dropdown menu like my music player  can be.
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B004UBH4S6 5 1358899200 73 so far this is my favorite horoscope app I've found for my kindle fire hd. I love love love how you can see your horoscope for multiple days(like yesterday & tomorrow, etc). Just wish I was  able to customize it more and be able to set my name and birth date so it would automatically go directly to my personal horoscope each time I open the app but other than that it's great!
A0855975204O8N178RKHV B008XAKC98 3 1358899200 77 Works alright on my kindle fire hd but I wish it had a better way to search titles and the movie selection is extremely limited. Advertisers to have big daddy and pineapple express but it has neither which is the whole reason I got this app so Wish there were more comedy titles like that. grandma's boy would be a great addition to add a  well. should not falsely advertise that they have movies that they don't.
A085914913DHJ6QM7Y00S B008IXP8IU 5 1365033600 21 A lot of fun and challenging to me. Very original. Stumbled across it while browsing and I am glad I did.
A085914913DHJ6QM7Y00S B00K7WGUKA 5 1403395200 23 My kids are so much better than this but me. They always beat my high scores. But it is very fun and challenging.
A085914913DHJ6QM7Y00S B008194C74 5 1369612800 31 Excellent game. A lot of levels instead of just a few. 99cents is a good deal. I don't know if there is a sequel to this game but I hope so.
A085914913DHJ6QM7Y00S B00AUXZJAS 5 1362009600 25 What a great way to wind down at the end of the day. Very challenging. I hope there is or will be a second edition.
A085914913DHJ6QM7Y00S B00F24OV8G 4 1382745600 36 I've played logo games before and they are all pretty much the same. This is definitely a different way to do it. It is a lot of fun. I will be looking for the next one.
A08719732Z95548FRM2M3 B00E6Z0THE 4 1396569600 100 This game was great! I was so addictited. I only have one prob with this game. It kept kicking me back to the main menu. Some times I was one step away from solving a puzzle and then I had to do it all over again. Besides that the game was fun addicting and HUGE! Like seriously sometimes it took a minute just to travel from one place to another to finish a puzzle. I love it as a FAOTD and would get the second  game. Also all the hints are free so don't worry about that. LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
A08761257GP04TJ0ROBS B00E5NH46Q 5 1392163200 28 I love this app it keeps me posted about my other favorite channel, I am always on the go so I use to miss a lot not anymore.

A08761257GP04TJ0ROBS B008ZOHCKE 5 1391472000 20 i love this app it allows me to put my unpublished manuscript into form, and review it at my lesure.
A08761257GP04TJ0ROBS B005ZXWMUS 4 1394409600 20 So far this app has done as advertise, but i have yet to view for a prolonged period. thank you.
A08761257GP04TJ0ROBS B00IZQOZB6 5 1396483200 23 I am very, very pleased with this app. i love the graphics,the shooting,the overall performance is excellent.thank you.I recommend this game to all.
A08791213RS423QMHKMG0 B00ASSF19Y 5 1358640000 20 This is the best app ever!!!! It keeps me occupied for hours!!! Get this app because you wont be sorry!!!
A08791213RS423QMHKMG0 B00AMRIZYY 5 1358640000 20 Wow!! I can't  belive this app was free!! It's so cool I would have thought it was a million dollars!!!!
A08791213RS423QMHKMG0 B009UX2YAC 5 1359849600 20 subway surfers is very fun and addictive. I love how they have the world tour. new york rio whats next.
A08791213RS423QMHKMG0 B00B2V66VS 5 1359676800 20 Temple Run Two is the best game ever. It is so addictive.  You should totally get the game.Really fun. Yay!
A08791213RS423QMHKMG0 B00E78QIDE 5 1376956800 20 it was really fun. some of it was hard. but then I figured it out and then felt really dumb.
A08791955FSE3WLZ9JEC B008MEM24S 5 1356480000 46 Fell in love with this game on my parents cell phone. Was so happy to find it on here. Fun to play. My 3yr old daughter can't get enough of this game always wants to play it. And does play s it well. She learns fast.
A08834052D64NUL662V3R B00D4EBQ3E 5 1398038400 30 This app is so much fun! Positively habit forming. Gives your brain a workout without being too difficult. A great stress reducer. Also good for kids to learn word association.
A08834052D64NUL662V3R B00AR1AUAW 5 1399161600 36 This game is so habit forming. I hate to leave a puzzle unsolved once I start it. There are sometimes more than one way to associate the words, but only one correct way. So much fun.
A08834052D64NUL662V3R B0064X7FVE 5 1373760000 47 The Weather Channel has always been great, but with this new format, it is AWESOME. The updated look is cool and easy to follow and to find different info. Only now, a person can earn points every time they log in towards meaningful rewards. Gotta love that.
A08834052D64NUL662V3R B0091REZMW 3 1400112000 76 So many games claim to be free. Technically, they are. But in order to complete them, to win and accomplish all levels, a person pretty much ends up spending some money. I play until I get stuck or it costs too much to continue. Then, I delete, and find another. They are fun, easy to play. I just started this one. Interesting storyline but I 've yet to see how far I get before &#34;free&#34; ends.

A08880513V0KPDJZRHPVG B004HXHVZ8 4 1357171200 77 It' s a product that performs the services it' s created for with adequate ease. It' s comparable to the Moviefone program in performing the duties they were both created for. They both could be even more of a one stop source if they carried the trivia and background information that the Imdb program makes available to the  public that may have an interest in those areas as well as the information the two programs I'm critiquing.
A08880513V0KPDJZRHPVG B0063IH60K 5 1357430400 51 This app is great in it's ease of downloading, simplicity of use, and the price is definitely right since it's free!!! I would certainly suggest it to everyone and anyone who enjoys the game! It's a good way to keep your mind active during those moments when you've got idle time.
A091518933EOKW410GSA9 B006OBWGHO 5 1353715200 30 everybody stop lying about the permissions I love this game and your making it unpopular and that is rude and dis respectful they should ban upu from downloading this game
A091518933EOKW410GSA9 B007TBHAOC 5 1355270400 25 I'm trying to get the. high score Ive got it like four times already but I highly recommend this game for your kids GREAT APP
A091518933EOKW410GSA9 B008JK6W5K 5 1355443200 29 this app is so fun if u think this is hard u r don't pay attention to any think at all so stop being a baby and grow up
A0926538LGZ1P4CJAQO2 B00DHQHQCE 4 1396483200 120 Finally,  a Kindle Fire Edition!!!  Plays great on my kindle fire.  I, WAS VERY SURPRISED, by being notified by this app IT was time to collect my mining goods and to go fight a battle!!!  With a smile, I know some are shaking their heads by that statement since that is what the game should do!!  But not, off the carousel !  You could play, clash of clans, castle clash, and others which are all from same cookie cutter mold.  Battle Beach, is different. Yet similar if you like those games;  yet  Not cookie cutter to the point you might just like this game, even if you don't like the others!  Just give it a try, cause it is awesome!!!!!!!!
A0926538LGZ1P4CJAQO2 B0071PARPA 5 1352851200 24 Kids  love  it!  Very  proud &amp;  eager  to  show  thier  work!  Adults,  can  use  if  bored!  It  is what you  have  in  your  mind!!!
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00GRVV29E 5 1394928000 77 This app is the best ever. The first time I opened the app, the amazing sight my eyes beheld was surprisingly delightful.  So hypnotic and relaxing, the best after a day full of chaos and stress, it's better than anything else to help you relax and let go.  Thank You to the developers who made the app and thank you Amazon.com for offering this app. You will be amazed at the beautiful artistic designs made by you!
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00BJA2VFW 4 1363392000 45 A gamer I am not so this game is for me. It is fun, the graphics are great/beautiful. It is great for kids on a long trip or in a long wait, love it, keeps them busy, when I play it helps pass the time.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B004EFYZ1C 5 1353110400 39 As with the Sun app, this is amazing and informative.  I recommend this app for anyone who is interested in astronomy and our moon. It also is good for young people to learn about the moon and it's phases.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B009ZZDNT6 5 1358380800 60 I have searched for an alarm clock app forever it seems, this app is the best!  It has all kinds of selections, you can even wake up to your favorite songs. My personal favorite is from ELO's "All over the world". Try it, guarantee you will love it! For the Kindle Fire H.D. 8.9 it is awesome. Thank you amazon.com!!!
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B006VW94HQ 5 1354492800 22 As with other word games, this game excerizes the brain. I recommend this app for anyone who needs to take a break.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B008PPGFZG 3 1354492800 42 The app did not want to open for me.  It may have been the user (me), but the reviews really did not sound that great.  I just wanted to give it a try, it's probably ok, but it may need some work.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00E8KLWB4 4 1401235200 69 G5 is awesome, this game is fun, challenging, and keeps me so interested that I have lost time while playing. The one thing that kept me from giving 5+ rating, the images are really small for my 8.9 kindle. Other than that, the quality in this game is awesome, the graphic art gets a 5+++ in my opinion.I highly recommend this game.Thank You Amazon.com and the creators of G5.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00AUXZJAS 5 1364774400 72 This game is awesome and complete exercise for the brain, spirit and the body. Mind Games Pro allows you to test reflexes,  attention span, memory, and math skills and more.  You can store your scores and watch your abilities grow.  The more you play the better your scores. For me, it feels like I exercised my mind and body.  Thanks to the people who made this product available and thank you Amazon.com.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B0067R8JNK 5 1370131200 87 Dabble, so much fun but more than that, it is exercise for your brain.  I love this game because it is challenging, so many levels and it can be easy, hard, or very difficult, but no matter, it still is highly addictive.Being disabled, this game is a good distraction from pain, boredom, or if you just want to pass the time.  It is also a good trainer for kids.I highly recommend this game because it is fun, but because it really does help keep the brain focused.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B0096YJDNQ 5 1370131200 155 If you are an astronomy buff like I am, own a telescope and just love looking up at the constellations, this app is for you.  It is easy to use and has every location (known) in the universe.  Try this and think of all the possible life there is, &#34;out there&#34;!I highly recommend this app.  This app works great if you can hook up your telescope to your Kindle Fire HD, just access the app and it can actually take your computer right to the constellation, star, planet or just &#34;somewhere out there&#34; (William Shatner).If you cannot use your Kindle Fire HD with your telescope the app is still extremely helpful.  Just life your Kindle Fire HD up to the sky and the app shows the night sky where you stand.  I highly recommend this app to amateurs as it is a great beginning to an awesome universe.Thank you Amazon.com again for offering this app.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B009LGKCS4 5 1353542400 39 I love word games. Never played this before, a lot of fun! I highly recommend this app to anyone who loves word games. There are a lot of levels, you think you know a lot? I thought I did.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B0097HSS4M 5 1398470400 27 Photo Editor+ is easy to use and makes your photos glamorous, funny, or what ever you want, useful scrap booking.  Thank you Amazon.com for offering this app.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00HFTHXMC 5 1400112000 79 At first I thought this game would be too easy, it is at first, but it does get better as you progress in the levels. When others say this game is addictive, they are right.  I started playing for what I thought was 10 minutes, not, more like an hour.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who needs some relaxation and excitement at the same time.Thank You Amazon.com and the seller of this game.  Look forward to more!!!
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00BUR9KJE 5 1369958400 131 When I was younger my Grandmother, brother, and cousins, and myself would sit around the kitchen table and play this game, sometimes all day.  55 years later, most of my family is gone; so when I saw this game in Kindle Fire edition, I jumped on it. It is soooo much fun and it reminds me of the old days.  You can play with up to four people or the computer bot's. Try this game, you will play this game and before you know it an hour or more has passed and you have had fun with this game.  Trust me when I say, it still is a challenge to get the score to be number one!!!I highly recommend this game.  Thank you amazon.com, you are just getting better and better.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00910Y1OQ 5 1369958400 135 This game has beautiful art, however, it does not take away from the game itself.  The game has three challenge levels.  The further you go in the game the harder it gets, you have to complete your tasks and collect all of the pieces of the artifacts or you lose a life. This game is great when you are trying to relax or you need a diversion to boredom.  I especially love the music and the art. In the game it also has a good story line, (if you want to read it, if not just skip).  But I recommend reading the story line, it just adds to the game.I highly recommend this game, it does help when I have a headache, thank you amazon.com, you have provided me with great pleasure with this game.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B00DREKMPO 5 1391212800 24 Mobile Security Antivirus (ESET), is fast and it keeps my Kindle Fire HD running smoothly and securely. I highly recommend this app from Amazon.com.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B0058EBNAO 5 1401840000 56 The first time I used this app, I was really impressed. With these new updates this app is awesome and easy to use.  Thank You Amazon.com for offering this app, and thank you to the creators of eWeather for offering your service to us through Amazon.com.  I look forward to all new updates in the future.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B0087SGWI6 5 1355443200 40 Since I have played &quot;Mind Games&quot; I have energy and feel happier.  It is recommended you play at least twice a day, I play 4 - 5 times a day, not just for brain exercise but it is fun too!
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B0067R0APK 4 1370390400 40 We love this app. It is easy to use and is 98&middot;9% accurate. It offers so much information about every type  often weather and then some. This app includes radar (Doppler, satellite, and street/storm watchers), all are easy to use.
A09272162BT4907RW59NJ B008194C74 5 1363910400 69 Another great game from amazon.com. This game is very good to get your brain up and moving. I like this game because you have to put words together, at first it is a piece of cake and then once you start to feel you are pretty smart, you are beginning to know the difference. This game is for all ages and will keep your attention for hours of fun.
A09394522L14OTBPZ39HJ B00C2KWKIG 1 1378684800 25 You should really review the games that you agree to put on-line before you release them! This is just one many that are really bad!
A09394522L14OTBPZ39HJ B00D6VP410 1 1378684800 57 Its a carbon copy of Bingo Run, which shares similarities to Bingo Vegas! Where's the originality? If you're going to make a new game come up with...(wait for it!!!) new rooms that make it a new game! Sheesh, do I really need to say anything about this? Overpaid programmers couldn't figure this out? 'nuf said I think?
A0940656302Z7FL0Z4SFF B008JGSM6G 5 1352246400 26 this game is very nice. many fun and challenging levels. i would tell anyone who likes puzzle or games that gets you thinking to download this.
A0940656302Z7FL0Z4SFF B009HKL4B8 5 1352592000 35 i love this game. its also addictive. you create your own characters, decide what to do with them and everything. your also able to buy houses and get married. fun for all ages and gender.
A0940656302Z7FL0Z4SFF B0097M6WDG 4 1351468800 27 Great game, very fun. I think they have updated it now everytime I open it, it says beta expired. I really hope that they fix it quickly.
A09411802MW8S2EUFLEYH B00CTQ6SIG 5 1391990400 32 This game is awesome... it is very fun to play. I love that the app give me notifications when something is done. I also like that I can add my friends city.
A09411802MW8S2EUFLEYH B008PPGFZG 3 1378771200 22 This app is just bad...it's annoying, you can't share pic...Well yea I really needs an update and such so yep that's all
A09411802MW8S2EUFLEYH B009ZXRC9A 3 1378598400 23 This game I decent... I mean like all ur doing is squishing ants and u could squish son of it own picture too
A09411802MW8S2EUFLEYH B00EHM0CVE 1 1378598400 23 This app is just really bad. It's very boring, and gets on my last nerves, I really don't decrement it to any one.
A094182421MQPOGPC3LC1 B00BGDEK9C 5 1366761600 21 This is a great game. The game play is very realistic. The quality of the graphics is outstanding. Download and play.
A094182421MQPOGPC3LC1 B00AOA9BL0 5 1365206400 27 This is a great app. Easy to use . Video quality is excellent . Whatever you have available on your  home service is available on the app.
A094182421MQPOGPC3LC1 B0089BPEZS 2 1365206400 22 Only gave it a 2 star review because the infinity app was more appropriate for my viewing needs.  It did work well.
A09424002A8OIM5OIFFNB B009LFGG76 2 1396656000 32 I just don't like the way the words appear instead of having a list to use. Ive always enjoyed word search but this app is just not a fun game to play!
A09424002A8OIM5OIFFNB B00J05XSGY 2 1398124800 30 You have to accept the fact that this game is unbeatable. But if you want something that will pass time and drive ya a little crazy then this is it!!
A09424002A8OIM5OIFFNB B00D948SS0 1 1396656000 41 I usually enjoy word search games and starting out I thought I was going to enjoy this one. I completed all the little middle boxes but have not been able to access the other ones around the center.I truly don't understand!!!
A09424002A8OIM5OIFFNB B00DJ075FQ 4 1396656000 22 I've always loved Mahjong! So far no major complaints. Only played it once so far but &#34;It's Mahjong&#34;!!!!!!!We'll see as time goes!
A09424002A8OIM5OIFFNB B005ZFOOE8 5 1397433600 42 I use iHeart radio on each of my devices. I have channels set for artists I enjoy listening to. I can go to bed at night, set the sleep timer and fall asleep listening to my music!! I highly recommend this app!!
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B008FC58ES 5 1403308800 21 I forgot how much I enjoyed playing cards. This game gives me the opportunity to enjoy playing cards again. Thank you
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B00CKOYVG8 3 1368835200 23 Lots of  fun, both my great niece and I enjoyed playing it today. She played while I was taking her to run errands.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B0064X7B4A 5 1368835200 21 Enjoy playing this game on my Kindle. I can keep up with my friends and still be able to watch television.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B00HCMG6LG 4 1390780800 22 I enjoy playing this kind of game. I wish there were more levels available for free and it didn't end so quickly.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B00A37XD90 5 1387152000 21 So much fun, easy to maneuver. Great animation. Fun for adults and children alike. I have recommended it to my niece.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B0094BB4TW 5 1368835200 20 So glad to have it on my Kindle. It is very cool to be able to check facebook from anywhere.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B0064X7FVE 5 1374192000 23 I really love being able to see the weather on my Kindle. It is cool to be able to see the weather anywhere.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1389744000 20 I enjoyed this game. It was so much fun to play. The levels are increasingly difficult, which keeps it interesting.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B0085VR7WU 3 1368835200 20 So glad I was able to find this game. I used to play all the time. Happy to have it.
A09525862Q8BG99HBIEY9 B00D1P685C 5 1403395200 24 This app helps keep my Kindle running smoothly. It is very important to clean up your Kindle daily, and this app does just that.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00CX5IXFY 5 1390867200 30 This solitaire game has variety of settings to play, not just one setting.It let's you play with the options you should have available on all solitaire games. Quick and easy.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00ELV0WF2 3 1404518400 26 I only rated this low because I couldn't read the game without getting a headache. It's my eyes, not the games problem. I like the game.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B008UXIDYE 5 1388275200 39 I like the many versions available and the different ways to set up this program. It's handy, easy to use and I find myself reading more Scripture than usual. I like the ability to add notes to the study.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B0063GORYU 5 1387843200 52 I don't get bored playing this fun card game. I don't have to be tied to a timer or competing with someone while playing this game. That's important and necessary during my work schedule. It helps me be patient as I wait for people to get done and are ready for me.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B007NZV2HK 5 1388275200 21 Easy and  fun in one game.The colors make it nice for my poor eyes to see without giving me a headache.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00DWZ3S90 5 1403827200 25 Lots of with many different puzzles and situations happening at each level. My children are into this game (ages 15-3) and enjoying the game too.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00JFYY2OC 2 1404864000 56 I am not sure yet. I read the other reviews, but decided to try it myself. I am having the same problems other players have had. I can't tell if it's my game filled with glitches or not. I looked on youtube, and tried those examples. I still have problems getting the game to do something
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B008JGSM6G 5 1387756800 33 This is a fun puzzle to figure out. You work it like electricity lines. I got it for my &amp;#34;engineer&amp;#34; in training. He (9) thinks these kind of games are loads of fun.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00AV8YANY 2 1403654400 32 It's fun to do and easy, but I don't want to play the game. I play other word games I like better. It's okay for some, just nothing I am interested in.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00GRTPZ3A 5 1403654400 25 Entertaining and I liked the variations of the game and played several of them. The hard part was I ran out of puzzles to do.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00AZKXNPY 2 1403654400 48 I prefer another program set up. They are easy to follow and play. Variations are good choices. I had a hard time playing this version because I kept getting a card I didn't want to play. I am not sure why. I have another game without that problem.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00702PZME 5 1404518400 26 Keeps me thinking with an open mind because you have to consider several possible answers. I like challenges that keep me thinking and this one does.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00DGEB2XG 5 1388275200 21 These are fun and challenging puzzle games that manage to not bore me. I like doing them with the grand children.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B0063IH60K 5 1404518400 15 I like the flexibility and simple playability this version offers. Clear and easy to play.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B008QMMEOE 5 1388275200 46 The first preschool learning game this guy enjoys doing. It's easy do this puzzle game and helps him to think about the shapes. I like how it allows him to make mistakes and corrections. These are important reading skills to help identify letter shapes and differences.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B006RXD2I6 3 1404518400 31 My eyesight made it difficult for me to play the game. This gave me a headache. I liked all the different card games, just couldn't read the screen without the pain.
A09529383LS1F1DOJV46O B00JV858HM 5 1404518400 42 Refreshing word play game. Keeps me figuring and thinking about common connections with these words. I also like being able to play the game at which ever level I want to play without having to begin at the beginning of the game.
A09533821SFZV7237XJHH B0064X7FVE 4 1371945600 26 I spect that it is difficult to know exactly what is going to happen and when.  Our condition is not always the same as the airport
A09533821SFZV7237XJHH B00D2K40WY 3 1371945600 20 My granddaughter loves this.  I don't get the fascination that she does.  Since it is free, I can't complain. OK
A09533821SFZV7237XJHH B009LGKCS4 4 1371945600 21 Would like to have an answer review.  I think a corrective device would be helpful.  After so many tires I tire.
A09533821SFZV7237XJHH B00H2TEG7U 5 1400371200 24 Played solitaire as a kid and did spend hours to entertain myself.I found playing one color verses several was easier when using my ipad.
A09768021CXERSKV95X9D B00EBE8MUG 5 1392076800 22 If you watch a lot of tv  then you will enjoy this game. A broad range of current shows to older shows
A09768021CXERSKV95X9D B00BGAZYLI 4 1371945600 23 If you like games that are challenging, this is one to try.  The pics are great.  a great puzzle game unlike the others
A09768021CXERSKV95X9D B004YXE438 5 1371945600 20 If you enjoy puzzle, this is truly a fun set.  I love the different levels and the pics are pretty
A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI B009MCRHH6 5 1358035200 115 I currently purchased a kindle fire hd7 and got a few apps and games and this was one. I have to say this game is great. Starts out easy as expected but towards the end it gets more complicated. The game looks beautiful and sounds great. The puzzles are so much fun to figure out and give you great satisfaction when completed. If you love to play games that will challenge your thinking and are fun to play then this is a must have for your collection.PROS:Beautifully done.Sounds are great.Extremely fun and addicting.Fun challenges that challenge you.Plenty of levels to complete.Works and looks great on kindle fire hd7.Good price.CONS:Hummmm let me think about it =)
A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI B00DDN6PB4 2 1380153600 160 The game itself is good. I enjoy the battleship style gameplay. I enjoy playing it and have been playing it almost everyday since i got it. I gave it 2 stars because to me its a good game but lost with its flaws.PROS:Fun gameplay.Addictive gameplay.Graphics are ok for what the game is.CONS:After you win or lose the game does nothing. You can keep shooting at nothing and getting shot by nothing on the board. You have to go back to main menu and start all over to play again.There are no level or different stages. You just keep playing the same stage over and over again. Would be nice to have different levels or stages after you complete one.There are no upgrades or ships to choose from. Would we be nice to have different ship styles or weapon upgrade options.All in all for free its a good game but i would not recommend it if you are gonna purchase it.
A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI B00AKL1XPU 2 1361750400 193 Ok so i am playing this game on the kindle fire HD 8.9. I did not have the game crash as other have but its is extremely frustrating that i cannot continue to play the game.I am in level 43 and cant continue to expand because all the animals i need i am force to buy with peanuts which cost real money. It is impossible to earn peanuts in the game so they force the player to want to spend real money on animals. Right now i cant do nothing since all the animals needed cost peanuts. So the game had become worthless.I HATE GAMES THAT TRY TO FORCE YOU TO MAKE IN GAME PURCHASES WITH REAL MONEY. EITHER MAKE THE APP FREE OR CHARGE A PRICE FOR IT BUT THIS IN GAME PURCHASES IS BULL.PROS:Fun gameNice graphicsAddicting.CONS:Needing in game purchases killed the game dead on. Cannot continue past a certain level unless you spend real money.Cannot earn peanuts in game to purchase animals.Game forces player to have to buy items in game to make the game playable.Dont recommend since you cannot complete the game without spending real money on in game junk.
A098370928I0YSRRQV0YI B009WYCDZU 5 1357171200 45 Been looking for some good games for my kindle fire hd and this one is one of the best ones I found. The cars control smoothly, the nitro is easy n fun to hit, graphics look good, nice variety of cars and races. Love it.
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B00CMF27DE 3 1391040000 51 A most furstrating game.  You can hardly earn enough points to play with a dauber.  Almost impossible to earn points for boosts and difficult to earn extra bingo games.I enjoy Beach Bingo by the same company and wish there were a way to use the points jointly on the 2 games.
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B00975HIYU 5 1384473600 76 I really enjoy playiung ths game.  It wprks well on the kindle fire.  My only problem has not to do with the game or its working for me I hate all programs which want me to hook up to or link with Facebook.  It is my choice not to do Facebook and I should not have the program shoved constantly down my throat or be penalised for not wanting to be connected with the program Facebook.
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B00B2TET3C 5 1391040000 38 I do really enjoy playing this bingo.  I like the fact if it hangs or something happens mostly you get  your points back.  I like the fact that earning bonus points is reasonablely available.  Well thought out program.
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B00FPISXPQ 5 1384473600 47 There is great challeng and quality pictures available to this program.  I like especially the variety of pictures to choose from.  A quality program which does not have any drawbacks I have come across.I would highly reccommend this program.  Works well on Kindle fire also my tablet
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B007TBAQCK 3 1391040000 43 I like playing Slotomania when it is working.  I get frustrated when it goes into long spins.  I find most games which require Facebook frustrating.  I choose not to do Facebook and do not see why I should be penalized for my choice.
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B00FYHXMQS 4 1391040000 54 It is both of the above and also very frustrating as you get close to finsihing the puzzle and time runs out.  Draws you back again and again to see how well you can do.  A wonderful time waster.  It simply slips past unnoticed and before you know it another day has slipped past.
A099280716ZEH5UPWAN4A B00CH26TL8 3 1391040000 26 This program does not make a lot of sense or purpose.  It is difficult to earn points and lives to continue.  So I play it seldom.
A09928591YYJUR492WKJA B004EBZX6W 5 1354147200 46 Nice App.  Lets me scan WLANs in the area, assess their signal strength, security type, and determine what channel's might be best for any WLAN I happen to be working with.  I think this is going to be a go-to app for me from now one.
A09928591YYJUR492WKJA B004DLNC4I 5 1354147200 36 I have this app on every Android device and computer in the house.  This app lets me scan public safety calls in my home town even though I live 1600 miles away.  Definitely a must have.
A1000413HXJGC8 B00IEBE7GK 5 1394755200 34 Hard to believe this sequel could be even better than the first game, but it is!  Thank you, Fireproof Games. I am looking forward to your next offering. I absolutely recommend this challenging game!
A10030KC6GYK89 B00CZCX2S8 3 1392681600 22 It would not work on my tablet, kept crashing and freezing up. I hope a better one will come along very soon.
A10030KC6GYK89 B00CDV6WDS 4 1379376000 22 I  love Mahjong, I can while away the hours on this game, and not get bored. I recommend it to any one.
A10030KC6GYK89 B005OQJG0K 4 1398643200 52 It worked great once I figured out how to use it. But not what I wanted. If you have wifi and have to shut it off when not in use, then this is great as you don't have to get up and turn the modem off. It saves your battery as well.
A1008B8GB8LA4L B00FAX6XQC 5 1385596800 22 I really love this game. I go it because I love hunting, it's fun and challenging. I'm really impressed with the graphics.
A1008B8GB8LA4L B00DJFIMW6 5 1387584000 20 I really enjoy playing this game. It's really fun and its easy to lose track oh time when I play.
A1008B8GB8LA4L B004UCO0FA 5 1396742400 32 I love how simple this is to navigate. Finding books and verses is fast and easy. Its nice to be able to quickly find what I need or make notes during church.
A10096011L0LW5NMIFP6A B006VW94HQ 5 1359504000 26 I just downloaded this game and I love it.  Very addictive plays well on my kindle file fire hd.  Keep the puzzles n word games coming...thanks!
A10096011L0LW5NMIFP6A B00DLJ31HQ 5 1392508800 22 Very stimulating game. I love all maribou games.  I like that there is also no time limit to guess the words.  Thanks!
A100B397ICZ9GO B00DLJ31HQ 5 1373500800 26 Love all your games they are fun to play with my kids they love trying to guess first before I get the answer. Fun fun fun!
A100B397ICZ9GO B00CAW96DI 5 1373500800 21 I LIKE GAMES THAT TEND TO STIMULATE YOUR BRAIN AND THAT I CAN PLAY WITH MY NIECES AND NEPHEWS...GREAT DOWNLOADTHANK YOU
A100B397ICZ9GO B00FX6ZBXC 5 1383264000 42 I love this game! It's easy and fun for any age! I like that it shows you if you have actually spelt a word correctly..the game is very easy and if you like word games you will like this one very much!!
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B007VUCAVO 5 1388534400 65 Battery HD Pro is a very valuable application, which installed and performed flawlessly on both our Kindle Fire 8.9 and 8.9 HDX.  The charging and discharging graphs can be utilized in a variety of ways to determine battery life, compare the energy efficiencies of different devices, as well as compare the energy utilization/efficiencies of various applications.The application has a very clean, functional, and uncluttered interface.
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B008M87GJK 3 1403568000 64 This app worked perfectly in the test drive mode, but when we downloaded and installed it, the app opens normally, but we can only swipe and view 2 of the news items pictured in thumbnails. We are unable to expand or view anything else. This appears to be a great application, but it does not seem to function well on our Kindle Fire HDX.
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B007U8JRWW 5 1391558400 293 iSpy Cameras installed flawlessly, and generally performed well on our Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. When one first starts the application, one is able to swipe through approximately 125 pages (groups) of 16 webcams worldwide. We found it best to examine each group, select the ones we were interested in (By selecting the particular thumbnail, then selecting the heart symbol (making sure it is blue)), which saves the selection to one's favorites.  There are some fascinating and beautiful views worldwide, of widely varying topics and locations. It is important to check the total selection at varying times of day, as some webcams will be dark or very poorly rendered at night.  Also, it is valuable to check some areas at their local twilight times, particularly those of beaches, bays, or other areas where sunrise and sunset really enhance the video display. Display quality varies widely. Some were too grainy or low resolution for our tastes, while others stood out as having surprising video quality, considering the limitations imposed by camera quality and bandwidth limitations.  Many of the webcams have been placed to provide truly artistic views, and it is very relaxing to view them. We really appreciated the variety of the selection. Utilization of this application can become very addictive, and you will find yourself gradually spending greater and greater lengths of time viewing the various sites at different times of the day.  In summary, we doubt you will ever find a program which yields a higher value for the very modest cost of purchase.  The only problems we experienced was the program occasionally would close without warning. Highly recommending for relaxing and viewing scenes worldwide! Just don't forget to peruse your "favorites" at various times throughout the day, particularly during their twilight times.
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B00H51RUZK 5 1390867200 58 Video Tube installed perfectly and performed flawlessly on our Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  We paid to remove the advertisements, as they were distracting.  The video quality is surprisingly good in HD,  the interface is uncluttered and functional. This application allows Kindle Fire owners to enjoy You Tube in true high definition, and is well worth the moderate cost.
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B004HX4RT6 4 1388188800 68 This application installed and performed flawlessly on our Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. There are many levels to select from, with a wide range of playing strengths. At the easiest levels, the program responds almost instantaneously. At the most challenging level, the thinking time increases. The interface is clean, uncluttered, and attractive. Very reasonably priced.!  We have been very pleased with all the applications we have purchased from A.I.
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B00CDV6WDS 5 1390521600 69 All-in-One Mahjong installed and performed flawlessly on our Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. The application features an exceptionally clean, attractive, and functional interface; with a beautiful selection of both tiles and backgrounds. The background music is very soothing and relaxing. The tiles are very well rendered, and are exceptionally legible. The only suggestion we would have for improvement would be the ability to save and reload a partially completed puzzle.
A100C5ZMTIVJQC B0096YJDNQ 5 1388188800 83 Distant Suns (max) installed and ran flawlessly on our Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. Probably the most attractive and comprehensive display of any of the astronomy applications available.  There are an incredible array of menu options for display and operation of the program. The only thing missing is a &#34;night viewing&#34; mode, with a dim red appearance for use outside. Hopefully the author and programmers will consider this in a future update. Nevertheless, this is an extremely useful application for anyone intererested in astronomy.
A100FH6KO19IJP B00964BWFS 4 1382745600 20 Easy to play. Very colorful graphics. Fun and a bit addictive. It's a great game for passing time and relaxing.
A100FH6KO19IJP B00BYJ6BUO 2 1381622400 24 It crashes way too often. It even froze my Kindle Fire HD. It would be a great app if it would worm without crashing.
A100FH6KO19IJP B00E8KLWB4 4 1395446400 45 The game is very easy to understand. And very user friendly yet it is challenging but not so that you get frustrated. Appart for the fact that it took more than usual to install...that may have been my connection... I like this game very much.
A100FH6KO19IJP B005ZXWMUS 4 1376438400 41 Pretty nice app! I like the app it offers a good variety of categories for all types of viewing preferences however I believe they are missing a lot of great movies and tv shows that they should add ro their library.
A100FILCOAJXE8 B00ANH526W 5 1369440000 22 I love this game, though it could be a lot more exciting then it is now, It is a pretty good game.
A100FILCOAJXE8 B00GK5Z7LQ 5 1391299200 23 It was amazing. And exciting I can't wait to play the next games. I'm sure they'll be just as good as this one
A100FILCOAJXE8 B00785P2QC 5 1371945600 24 Love This Game it's so cool! I'm so addicted to it I just love it.I just love the scenery and graphics and the goals

A100HERXR9KF6F B009ZZDNT6 5 1404259200 8 great app. I use it a lot .
A100IEPRBXZT98 B00AEWUQG2 5 1358640000 35 I love the variety within each levelled category.  I enjoy challenging my brain as I play.  It will be fun to play with my kids.  I wish there was a pass and play version too.
A100IEPRBXZT98 B008Y7SMQU 4 1350086400 28 good game for multiple people.  still a challenge. could use more hints especially for the foreign symbols or companies.  maybe have an American version and an international version.
A100IEPRBXZT98 B008IXP8IU 5 1362441600 43 If you are looking for a word game that is quick fun and challenging--7 Little Words is it.  Some games can be quick and easy while the next one really makes me think.  Having optional hints can help when you are truly stuck.
A100KNKZ1AO4ZI B005XQLBU4 5 1326585600 38 the first missle command clone that got it right and added to the concept by adding upgrades and the ability to rebuild/fix damaged buildings... awesome on my kindle fire..not so great on my droid...  good job epic pixel.
A100KNKZ1AO4ZI B0073XT3GY 3 1339459200 50 this game is a angry birds clone with a twist...not bad..except I dislike games that marry the music to the sound effects...the music in this game is pure torture ... turn off the music..sound effects go with it...very poor design..its common sense..fix this and ill change review to 5 stars
A100KNKZ1AO4ZI B008HSOT18 4 1344470400 28 I like the game..nice for a FAOTD..just a simple fun version of battleship...if you are expecting battleship 3d with Michael bay explosions...this is not the app for you.
A100KNKZ1AO4ZI B0089ZM1GY 5 1341446400 24 nice game for a free app of the day ..u do not need to pay extra money to enjoy this game.... good time killer
A100KNKZ1AO4ZI B00657H8XO 4 1325376000 28 great game for kindle fire..but, game is way too short for a paid for app..needs difficultly settings as well..too easy. but very addictive and a great time killer..
A100PN7UCWKTQG B006QMNQ6Q 4 1349827200 21 I like it because I can walk away from it when life calls, not lose anything and jump right back in.
A100PN7UCWKTQG B006C4U9RW 5 1349654400 83 I can never remember the names of songs or musians (sorry folks).  This app is so great because I don't have to.  Right off the bat I can choose a genre to match an activity I'm doing.  That's it.  I'm just learning this but have be much more successful than with Pandora or iheart.etc... because this app does all the collecting for me.  I still have the option to not likea song, but it's easy to from one genre to another.I love this
A100PN7UCWKTQG B008UXIDYE 5 1347148800 25 I've been looking for a Bible app and this is much easier to use.  Like the built-in audio so I can listen anywhere I am.
A100PN7UCWKTQG B007FFZSE6 5 1364256000 27 I have no experience using photo editing software and this was very simple with great results.  This  feature is turning out to be a lot of fun.
A100PN7UCWKTQG B009YOX6XQ 1 1360195200 42 Finally figured out why I no longer have the categories I had set up.  A new version is out.  Of course this is no longer free.  This is really disappointing.  I will be looking for other free apps that do similar things.
A100UDEB7H4QF5 B006C1ZSO4 1 1331510400 19 creepy...dude I feel like I'm in a haunted houseand I don't get the gameI think kids would get scared
A100UDEB7H4QF5 B0066T8M1I 4 1339372800 39 I love this game and I play it every day.  although it seems to me that whoever goes first wins.p.s.  try to own as many properties as you can and try to at least have one in every color
A100UDEB7H4QF5 B00766HXAQ 1 1332374400 23 please don't get this game. it sucks. I deleted it right after I tried it and it takes forever to join a room.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B008FETAQS 5 1345766400 46 Wow really this game isn't that bad. Its like a lot of other face book games that are out there but what's not to like? You do missions you get coins, weapons, cars and you get to wipe the earth from the scum of the universe.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00BFUUMO8 1 1362355200 100 have done everything to try to get this to load but sadly it wont. I will try again at a later date maybe even change my one star rating. I have several friends with Ipads that rave about this game. I saw it available for my Kindle Fire and was super excited. It shows that downloads 121.5 Mb and then it crashes and I go back in it does it again it loads crashes and keeps doing the same thing. Please fix this issue I am a huge fan of Jurassic Park franchise and have been waiting for this game.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B008D2QRAO 4 1343433600 33 not a bad slot game. it would be nice to be able to make higher bets right away. and the minigames are fun to play when you get the chance to play them.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00H51RUZK 2 1395360000 39 This was a five star app until I updated it yesterday. Now every time I try to do a search, it force closes every time. you can now only view what is popular on main screen. please fix this!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B008G0K9OS 4 1342310400 73 Not a badlittle FPS game your character does not move just the gun. If it was a rail shooter like Umbrella Chronicals it would really rock. This game takes me back to the days of the arcade style shooters like house of the damned. All in all not a bad game a great way to waste some zombies and some time. A solid four stars from me. Keep up the great work PNIX!!!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B007PT3QOQ 5 1333065600 39 Fun and very entertaining love how the game just throws in the random disasters and stuff, you never know what's going to be next to either help you or destroy stuff. Fur fun fun way to waste some time.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B007PTJOV0 5 1338422400 59 Wow this takes me back I grew up playing all the gaming stations Atari ,NES, Sega 16 bit, super NES, Nintendo 64 and forward this is just like Super Mario Bros. and works well but I wish you could go down the tree trunks like the tubes in Mario Bros. All in all its been very fun to play.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B0085N9I84 4 1337904000 72 This looked like it be fun so I thought I would try it out. Yes it is fun to play I do find myself checking in on my little monsters 3-4 times a day. My only problem is the quests that pop up should reward you more than they do, but hey its a neat little game. The little hippie monster is my favorite with it's head banging and Willie Nelson bandanna.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00C2VIA52 4 1366329600 114 Its just like MTG so if you enjoy playing that you will like this. I did just start playing this and Magic the Gathering and I'm enjoying both. So far. I just wish this was maybe a few bucks to buy and you get a really good deck to start and then have option to buy better cards later while earning/winning others then this would be a five star game in my eyes. Also I have had a few glitches where it closed game out once and yes you have to click spells a few times to get them to work. But still not a bad game I say it is worth the download.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00ELMHHAE 5 1388102400 33 nice graphics fun animations you cant go wrong with that. I would say if you are a fan of slot machine games you will like this one. well, atleast give it a try.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B009S98W3Q 5 1351555200 69 This has to be the best shoot and run game I've played in a long time. The controls are so simple my three year old can play this AWESOME game. The storyline is unique, great music and fun graphics. What more can you ask for. Play save up coin for the lasergun it totally rocks! If you have a kindle fire this is a must to have on it.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B0066T0EVE 5 1331856000 68 I bought this game the other day when it was only. 49 cents! All I can say is this runs great on my kindle fire and looks fantastic. Yes this game is well worth the money, however I do wish there was a multiplayer mode that would make this game just that much more awesome. Don't hesitate get this game and have some fun destroying some space monsters.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B008M2WGRI 5 1352073600 70 I have to say this is THE game to own for shooter gamers. Seriously. what's not to like? zombie killing mayhem, co-op survival, player vs. player team matches. This game ROCKS!!!! Well worth the dollar. Get it now play some co-op games (4-5) and you are up 200K coins. Upgrade the chainsaw 200 damage! and get the doctor dude and you can really rack up the dough!!! Get this game!!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B0080IOHLW 4 1344038400 63 not a bad little game amusing but slow moving. I feel it costs way to much to build a new floor/ level. I mean by the time you need to build the fourth floor you have to pay 4500 coins. However, my little girl loves to watch the characters walk around so for it being a free game it okay. Solid four stars.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B009AUS7U6 4 1349827200 50 All in all not a bad game sometimes it feels as though the Pc/AI cheats a little. I have not tried the multiplayer yet but this is a good way to waste some time. What's not to like about monkey on monkey violence. The expression's of their faces are priceless.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B008VBYN80 4 1354320000 63 this has been entertaining so far. my biggest complaint is my son accidentally uninstalled my game and after spending all day on it, I couldn't get it back and had to start over. I was even logged in with a gameloft Acct. and facebook. I like that you actually get to battle people in this game makes it unique. a solid 4 stars.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00CHSPB8Y 4 1367625600 63 I was expecting this to be a mission type game but its more of a runner type game which is still AWESOME! What's not like you get to be IRON MAN. And build other suits? Yes you get to do that. Controls are tough to start with but once you get the hang of it your good to go. Great game get it!!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00B2V66VS 5 1359158400 36 The graphics and new abilities of TR2 are unbelievable!! This is a most own for all Temple Run players/fans. What's not to like, running on cliffs, sliding down ropes, riding in mine cart's! LOVE THIS GAME!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00A3NQNUU 5 1357948800 86 I am so glad that this is out for the Kindle Fire now. I had this game on my Ipod and loved it but even though I logged in with my facebook account my game sadly didn't transfer. Well I guess I will start over but that's cool sad but cool. This really is a neat game especially when you get to start letting your dragons compete in the stadium for gems and coins. My kids love watching my dragons and feeding them until they grow.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00AF6MF9I 5 1379980800 47 I have been playing this game now for a few months straight. When it first came out there some issues and I stopped playing it. Now those things are fixed and this is a must play game. The storyline rocks and the player vs player is great.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00EUCL6R0 5 1380585600 93 This is a great turn style RPG. Its storyline and quests are fun and uniquely different. All the characters are cool and all have neat backgrounds to follow. You get to pick and choose which quest's to take all making the storyline fun and changing. After level four you get the option to join or create faction. Leveling up does take some time after level five but that's what make this a great game things aren't just handed to you, you have to earn them. This game is very much worth the download.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B007V2UGPE 4 1337040000 34 This is a very fun game very addicting. Its got great background music and graphics. The only thing is you cant pick a difficultly setting so by stage 12 it's HARD! but still fun.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00GOZQ2E8 4 1386720000 45 I must say this game isn't too bad. you get up and running quickly enough. However, I don't like that you have to pay to have your people attack monsters and do missions.  Other than that its been fun so far. I would recommend it.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00876UUN6 4 1340841600 27 Fun game so far and the graphics are really good on the kindle fire. Its a pokemon game what more can you say just as fun too.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B009DRL9YM 5 1348790400 30 Not to bad. You should be able to increase character stats as you level up though and have a Max level for each character. Still a good game very entertaining.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B007JPG04E 4 1331856000 50 This is a great game or I should say awesome game!!! Best of all this is a free game right now so get it before they change their minds. Yes you do have to pay for some stuff but it's still an awesome game yes even on my kindle fire!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00AW3FDIO 4 1369353600 53 So far so good I have experienced a couple glitches but that's okay. I have just started playing but am enjoying the graphics and sounds. Thought it was going to have more of a story line, it is more of a arena type game. But I say so far worth the. 99 cents.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00AO2P3GA 5 1363478400 125 I haven't played MC since the first one came out a couple years ago. I thought I would like to try this one and I am so glad I did. The graphics are just as good as a console can offer in my opinion. With headphones on the sound is incredible and trust me if you have little kids around you'll want them. There is a lot language. I just started playing and there seems to be a good story plot behind the game. The best thing is this game was on sale .99 cents. But even at the seven dollar range its well worth the giant download (almost 2gb) but my KindleFire handles it just fine. Gameloft knocked this one out of the park.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00CKW6FVE 4 1369785600 39 great version of Tetris very addictive. my only complaint is the special abilities cost just a bit to much coins. that's the only thing I would change make them less or permanent and only cost to upgrade the abilities.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00ANUMR1W 5 1356480000 90 I have been waiting for this game since thanksgiving to come out for kindle fire. This game rocks!! If you liked Blood and Glory then you will love this game. It is a huge download but well worth the wait. I will say this health potions need to be available to get with coins not the glu coins. I can understand the other things epic items and such. Or make the game a few bucks and let us play. Other than that this is a hit out of the park.
A100VWQDTPCP7K B00DJFIMW6 5 1391558400 50 This is an amazing game! If you love the DM movies and of course the MINIONS you will love this game. This has great graphics the original DM soundtrack cute animations its the whole package. This is a have to own game for the whole family to enjoy! 5+++++ stars!!
A100VWQDTPCP7K B0099WWKTO 4 1348876800 116 Awesome graphics my kids love to watch my dragon do tricks. However, why aren't there any foods that cost the gems to buy? I mean I understand people have to get paid for making these awesome games. But I would rather have paid a couple bucks and been able to do more in the game and pay for the REALLY good stuff if I so choose. Again a great game but come on GLU at least let us have access to the basic things that make games well games. Then if we want to fork over an arm or leg for the epic items we can again choose to do it not have to do it.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B005ET78TS 5 1373328000 59 I recently tracked my spouses trip to New England and back to Arizona with FlightBoard, and it is so easy to use without having to go to the individual airlines flight status page to get departure and arrival info. on your flights.  And it provides excellent alerts to flight delays and how they will affect the total flight time.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B008R5RGAC 5 1373328000 22 I have my other computers armed with security software and it is important for every media device.  Glad to have Norton's protection.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B009WO7NQO 5 1374624000 52 Anything that can capture my attention like these birds and pigs and make time disappear is wonderful.  My hat is off to the Finnish gents who created this entertaining app.  Try it, you may regret it if your time is more valuable than &#34;getting those pigs&#34;!  Especially in a Star Wars environment.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B00BMR5HOO 1 1370649600 21 This app never could find my location (large city) so worthless to me.  I have enough weather sources as it is.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B0059WTMLW 5 1373328000 30 I'm not a natural with Sudoku, which makes it that much more challenging for me.  Good wholesome pastime, especially when I'm waiting to be seen by the doctor, dentist, etc.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B00850NK6I 5 1373328000 31 This app is essential to borrow e-books from my local library.  It works wonderfully.  Very easy to get library e-books loaded on my Kindle Fire HD.  Absolutely, a must have app.
A1010TKT1JLMVM B004GMJKTK 3 1386806400 28 The game has frozen on me from time to time therefore it is unpredictable as to when you can finish a game.  Has some bugs that need attention,
A1014OI3FDQJJI B00CRLSN4U 4 1392249600 25 This game is fun my little cousin knows more movies then I do. It is so much fun. And most movies I have never seen.
A1014OI3FDQJJI B00HDRTGDK 5 1392249600 21 This game brings back some great memories from when I was a kid half of these things you can't find anymore!
A1015TBT7K9CQ6 B00EW3STPY 2 1386547200 34 There are a lot of puzzles it seems but only three come with the free version. Very disappointing from the description.  It seems like it may be fun but not as a free app.
A1015TBT7K9CQ6 B00DJFIMW6 5 1379980800 33 This game is addicting do not play it or you will lose all your friends. I think I am still married now but I am not putting the game down to find out.
A1016653VSOFHA3LYKU6 B00FS0VUWO 5 1386374400 27 IT IS A GOOD GAME BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY EVERY PLANE.You start out with 3planes and buy the rest.OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A GOOD GAME
A1016653VSOFHA3LYKU6 B00E994GPI 1 1376697600 34 I tried to open it and it says that I need to update. My little bro got this and was disappointed because he liked the beat your boss original and couldn't play this one.
A10175AMUHOQC4 B00FDUH4WY 5 1390867200 28 just alot of fun and saves money that's the best part no losing at the real casino's. we need money for more important things so save and behave
A10175AMUHOQC4 B00BZ17Q8M 5 1396828800 27 Just Had A Great Time Glad That I Can Play For Free And Not Wasting Money At The Casino And Mad At All The Lines There Are
A10175AMUHOQC4 B00EC5ZFL8 5 1396828800 35 had fun with slots really helps pass time when you are bored with nothing to do. how ever was just that not great in my opion but I don't like gambling so that's just me
A1018D502E27E6 B004J1DBJI 4 1398297600 144 After hearing that iApple linked SIRI to this web site ( I hope they pay) I put the app on my Nexus 7, thanks iApple for the free ad time. I was in Mexico and kept seeing different things in the sky at night. Well this I.D.ed about 700+ things in the sky with position etc. So I was able to find a moving satellite that provided a low orbit and tv signals to ships.. seems that one was colorful enough to spot and track. From that simple search to advanced math, was a easy move, however as other reviewers stated, you have to learn how to request complex calculations, ie I wanted to know how many gallons per minute a 1/2 inch pipe delivered at different pressures for various liquids.. it took me a little bit to get it off the gasses calculation..
A1018D502E27E6 B00DX65ORM 3 1389571200 109 This game is a love hate relationship. They beg you to buy some game credits with the carrot that if you do, the annoying ads will stop. So I tried, google immediately issued a warning that it would not be secure and did not recommend the purchase. So I did not. Game play is good, you can get extra credits over time, but it seems the better you get the more credits you lose, even betting the same amount per spin. So there is not any way to really have fun BECAUSE they want you to spend money on them.. It is a group from China so be warned.
A1018D502E27E6 B00E616R5Q 4 1379721600 55 My wife got me into playing this game, her favorite on long plane rides. There are many aspects of the options to win as well as betting too many credits to lose. They keep it interesting with spins, high res graphics, and sounds.  Do not pass this one up as an effective time waster lol.
A1018D502E27E6 B00F9ZO3Z4 1 1389571200 20 Another game from China, that is annoying in play and use. Skip it and save your self the download time.
A101A5HL70JTM6 B005UQ9FNC 5 1324252800 20 its an ok time filler but cant see the info of the birds anymore its just a blank white square
A101A5HL70JTM6 B00AKL1XPU 4 1381017600 28 its an ok game but I got to level 17 an then opened my game to collect from my animals an it restarted the whole game on me.
A101AHLTLNXF7V B004JOSUMI 5 1361923200 22 This apps works pretty good on my kindle, I can download my favorite songs and videos, this is a must have app
A101AHLTLNXF7V B00529IOXO 4 1359331200 25 The reason I'm giving y'all four stars is because when I get a text on my kindle it doesn't go off,but everything else is great
A101AHLTLNXF7V B00AO2P3GA 5 1358208000 20 This game is pretty awesome, good graphics, very good campaign, and good multiplayer, so gameloft I give you five stars
A101AHLTLNXF7V B00AESN8XY 5 1356739200 23 Very good game,must have and its so cool to be a virus or plague that destroys the world and cause chaos and anarchy
A101AHLTLNXF7V B00FAX6XQC 5 1384819200 31 It's got a lot of weapons and places and its fun and the customizable weapons are cool very good game and I recommend this game if you have a kindle fire
A101AHLTLNXF7V B00B2V66VS 5 1359072000 28 This game is awesome and its FREE and I recommend people getting this game. This game is better than the first temple run. It's fun and more challenging.
A101AHLTLNXF7V B007TNQ7EY 5 1359158400 27 It's pretty much like gta and its got good graphics but the controls are a little hard at first but this app is great for kindle fire
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B00B2TET3C 4 1365379200 20 Bingo beach is a fun bingo game. It helps me kill time during the day. It's a very enjoyable game.
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B009ZS2B28 3 1363392000 40 I LOVE THIS GAME! BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE BINGO CALLER CALLS THE SAME # MULTIPLE TIMES IN ONE GAME. EVERY TIME IVE PLAYED BINGO THE #'S WOULD ONLY BE CALLED ONCE PER GAME. FIX THIS PLEASE YOU CHEATERS
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B0088Y7YHW 3 1362960000 20 SLOTS NEEDS TO GIVE MORE TOKENS TO PLAY WITH. ALSO I'M PRETTY SURE ALL OTHER PLAYERS WOULDN'T MIND MORE PAYOUTS.
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B00DWJBOI8 4 1375833600 22 I liked the game, but the trial game was not long enough. If the trial were longer, I would 've loved it.
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B0091REZMW 4 1359331200 20 I like this game. It is very addicting. Hidden object games are fun to play. Can't get enough of them.
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B00A9JG6RS 5 1362355200 20 This game is great. I thought it was going to be a dull game but I was way wrong. GREAT!
A101DZDEZJ7E9U B008JJS6D2 4 1359590400 20 you should get this game if you love bingo.  I definitely recommend it. so what are you waiting for? hurry!
A101K1EH8VRTMP B0054JZC6E 5 1327276800 22 wow. so amazing. if you did not download it, you should. it rocks. hope you like it. I liked it a lot.
A101K1EH8VRTMP B00AEWUQG2 4 1356220800 27 it iws pretty good but it would be way much better if they let us spin a second time if we were smarter than a 5th grader
A101K1EH8VRTMP B00CB2837W 2 1369180800 31 wannts you get In the game you really cant play.when you are done and you Wanna x out on something it wont let you because there is no x button. :(
A101KI6HJUPHM0 B006OIK6JC 4 1371686400 21 Easy to use interface and good result.  But i was hoping for more categories, like anniversary.  But I still recommend it.
A101KI6HJUPHM0 B004SJ3204 5 1371686400 21 A very good cribbage program that is so fast and good it become addictive.  But that's not really a negative ;-)
A101KI6HJUPHM0 B00A02220E 2 1371686400 22 I was hoping for something more like a greeting card application I remember from my PC days.  This was much more limited.
A101Q7PGHKL3QF B0064DBE9I 4 1325808000 26 Works well on the kindle fire. My grandson will get a kick out of it I'm sure. It's a cute app anynow. Can't argue with free.
A101Q7PGHKL3QF B00514DIE0 5 1325808000 52 I love my kindle fire &amp; I love this game. Great graphics the tiles fit perfect on the screen. I like that you can change the background &amp; tiles to fit your mood quite a selection to choose from. Quite additive be careful. So worth the download &amp; better yet it's FREE!!!!!
A101TJAE8S4553 B00824BM76 1 1383609600 42 This app has put crashes on my KINDLE FIRE HD. It wouldn't turn on so I took it to Best Buy and they said it was one of rose GLITCH apps. So do not get the app. I hope this helped you.
A101TJAE8S4553 B00AZL3PBK 5 1371427200 32 Lep's world is an awesome game to teach kids physics. It may not seem like it but your child is actually learning by games. I rate Lep's world five stars. Do you?
A101UO5QILLGHM B004VMTI42 4 1336348800 28 have program for about 2 weeks. works well. runs videos pretty well. only thing negetive I can say is that it bothers you to comment on the product
A101VEXG12GL29 B00ET0PZDO 2 1389657600 33 The game concept is great, but it takes forever to load and sometimes never does.  It closes unexpectedly and freezes frequently.  This would be a fun and challenging game if it worked properly.
A101VEXG12GL29 B00CSR2J9I 4 1388534400 20 Fun to play but also more difficult than expected. Just about the time you think &#34;I got this&#34;, you flip!
A101VEXG12GL29 B00FN811SY 5 1388534400 21 This puts the new Bible at your finger tips.  A great & easy way to carry a Bible when you travel.
A101VEXG12GL29 B0064TVQ5E 1 1375056000 20 Not anything like the games on the computer.  Found it difficult to use. Good thing it was free. Deleted it!
A101VEXG12GL29 B00514DIE0 3 1387238400 21 It is what it is titled, Random.  Game lacks ability to go back to easier puzzles or select and/or changes options.
A101WFMYQUKLQN B008XG1X18 5 1347580800 20 It makes browsing  and pinning soo much eadier than trying to go through the web on my kindle! So happy.
A101WFMYQUKLQN B00CLVW82O 5 1383868800 44 This is one of my favorites by far. It has a few seines with finding hidden objects but alot of sences where you have to figure out what and where you items go which I love more than finding hidden objects all the time.
A101WFMYQUKLQN B00AA87JGU 4 1355184000 30 I'm not too far into the game yt but it looks promising. I am excited to see what the higher levels will hold. Seems like it will only get better.
A101WM8VOCVKSN B004KU5LHS 5 1371081600 40 I tried the free version first but quickly updated. has all the features I wanted. totally worth the money. not sure if it totally right on my ovulation days...but it comes within 2 days of guessing when I will start.
A101X0JLT10IXG B00I5UHKPA 5 1395273600 53 Loved this game, it had beautiful graphics, fun puzzles and an easy hints option you could turn on if you got too confused what to do next. A pretty long game, took me more than a week to complete it, and the mystery/detective aspect was fun. Highly recommend! (PS. Works great on Kindle!)
A101X0JLT10IXG B00FGFVMGA 5 1395273600 48 Loved this game! One of the first puzzle games I played on my Kindle. Beautiful graphics, just the right amount of hints to get you through a tough spot and a wide variety of different puzzles to figure out. Wish there were more games like this out there!
A101X0JLT10IXG B00F0U8SAO 5 1395273600 72 Stunning graphics, unique game design, unique storyline, interesting puzzles. I just wish it was longer! Honestly the ending had me a little baffled (I won't give away what it is) but it didn't subtract from the fun of the game. Highly recommend! Also worked great on my Kindle, only one glitch later in the game at a big cinematic moment, but after I closed the game and reopened it, it worked fine.
A101X0JLT10IXG B00I3D27CU 3 1395273600 41 Fun game but glitchy on my Kindle, I have to &#34;poke&#34; something several times before the game registers that it's an item I can grab, or a puzzle piece I can fit in place. Frustrating! Otherwise fun. Wish it worked better!
A101X0JLT10IXG B00E6Z0THE 5 1392854400 22 A fun variety of puzzles and lots of different areas. Kept me busy for several days. Highly recommend! Works great on kindle.
A101XB9AJZLCX7 B0087TUZII 5 1344124800 28 good game if u don't want to think what I'm saying it is easy after a while I get boraed I would rather it be a little harder
A101XB9AJZLCX7 B007OXASB2 5 1337731200 20 it was cute but better for younger childeren I am not young any more but I still enjoyed playing it
A101XB9AJZLCX7 B0099WWKTO 5 1352246400 40 it is too cute who wouldn't want to have little dragons they can create and play. I give me something to do when I'm borad and I think any. one with finger could play this game it is soooo cute
A101YG9NPBR593 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1391990400 21 This game is just like flappy bird but the bird feels heavy it does not fly as good.I love this game
A101YG9NPBR593 B00AIUUXHC 5 1379721600 33 I love this game you always play it all the time .if this game was on the wii that would be very cool. thank you for creating it . loveing this amazing app.
A1026DPL2DHAVK B0069G5Z9K 4 1348790400 35 this app is pretty fun but gets really boring after a while. I played it and at first I loved it but then it just seemed to get old its the same thing every time
A1026DPL2DHAVK B004SJ3BCI 1 1338595200 24 Angry birds is so boring all you do is knock down the pigs and then the birds are doing flops and stuff it's stupid.
A1026DPL2DHAVK B0086700CM 5 1338595200 25 This game is fun and intense you get so addicted to this game you never want to put it down.  Temple Run is so fun.
A10299KLOWWYV3 B009MO89Y4 5 1365897600 25 My 3 and 6 year old grandsons love to play this game.  They like the sounds and keep them amused for a little while anyway.
A10299KLOWWYV3 B00DJFIMW6 5 1384819200 25 I personally have not played this but my grandsons love it and so do their parents. It has now become the game of first choice
A10299KLOWWYV3 B00FAPF5U0 5 1386288000 25 Very addictive and fun.  Like the fact that it makes you wait a time to continue game.  That way it doesn't seem quite so addictive.
A1029ESOR657OQ B00E8KLWB4 5 1405987200 34 One of the best search games that I have tried .  Lots of interesting things to do and try. Still trying to figure out how to earn more crystals.  I really like this game.
A1029ESOR657OQ B0066T8SDU 5 1358467200 40 Pretty much the same as the board game, except that you can also play on line. If you love playing and someone's around you can also pass and play. I'd much rather play this than shoot birds from a slingshot.
A1029ESOR657OQ B007VUCAVO 5 1365897600 24 Great app, nicely done. Well thought out and nicely implemented.Tried the free one, worked so well I gave them my money. So should you.
A1029ESOR657OQ B009XAJI8S 5 1357257600 41 Tried the free app and was pleasingly surprised. I live in Mexico and use Netflix which is an order of magnitude WORSE than the US service. This isn't perfect, ad sometimes a channel just won't work, but it is not bad.
A1029ESOR657OQ B0085VR7WU 4 1344124800 19 fun game but needs some worktoo many restrictions put on play. Can not bet as much as on desktop
A1029ESOR657OQ B0067R8JNK 5 1374710400 40 Challenging, to say the least.I love word games: Scrabble, BookWorm, etc., and this one is just as much fun, and a bit harder, because it's different. In comparison, it's sort of Sudoku, but with letters, if you can imagine that.
A1029ESOR657OQ B00EEDJHXA 5 1401753600 30 Nice easy-going game. One of those simple pleasures of life. Lots of levels.  I like the snipping sound of the scissors and the buttons falling. Like I said, simple pleasures.
A1029ESOR657OQ B00DGMVC4C 5 1374710400 73 I had the first Sparkle game and enjoyed it, so when I saw this available, and read the reviews, I picked it up also.My wife and I both love the game, immensely I might add. Parts of the game are challenging, but not too hard, and are excellent for casual play: very relaxing, almost Zen in quality,. but when that pales, other parts are harder, and can get very hard, but still fun.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B008MAGJTQ 4 1374105600 23 This game is very enjoyable and challenges your mental thought process. Do think that more time needs too be allowed after stage  five.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B00E8W4HQE 4 1380758400 26 Functions well and is entertaining also doesn't require reload of coins as often as others.Only applies too one of the games still waiting  Too play others.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B00BEPVAV8 5 1374105600 21 I really enjoyed playing this game. The game allows for good eye coordination. Really was enjoyable too play with the granddaughter.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B0081JPTXK 2 1374105600 35 IT  performs but not as good as actual app from double down. It registers wins in upper left corner that are not there and lower left. It's pretty frustrating. They need too correct the problem.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B00CKW6FVE 3 1374105600 22 Perform s well although it become s extremely annoying too keep putting up with pop up advertising. But game needs some improvements.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B00H2TEG7U 5 1387238400 39 Enjoyable  game with content changing constantly. Utilizes mental thought along with hand and eye coordination. Would recommend this game too all ages. Although it is irritating to receive an advertisement for another game after completion a game of solitude.
A102EF0C5PF3TU B005HSL626 5 1374105600 22 This game is very enjoyable and challenges your hand and eye coordination. I would recommend this game too any of my friends
A102EOWUPZQXBI B004HXHVZ8 5 1330560000 25 Enjoy being able to see options and when, where so that we can plan on what to see. The trailers help to finalise the process.
A102EOWUPZQXBI B007GE0X3M 5 1389139200 22 Enjoy this app. It is one of my favorites. It is concise and informative. The information is broad in coverage and context.
A102EOWUPZQXBI B00GCI69D6 5 1387065600 23 This is my favourite weather app. Check it first thing. It is quick, clear and accurate. It is fun with a great design.
A102EOWUPZQXBI B0060I3IJG 5 1351382400 33 I enjoy this app, it allows me to choose to my interests. The developer will improve as time goes along with more depth and variety. It is great right from the first go!
A102HZ2AH6129C B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366156800 21 i just got this app and its pretty good so far im reviewing it early becausr i'll get 10 free hints
A102KXC7ZQRJOO B00AQM8H9I 5 1366934400 22 This game is very entertaining and fun! I am trying to find more games by fantasy flight because this is so fun!
A102KXC7ZQRJOO B006PH7WBM 5 1354492800 23 I love this game! When I contacted the company they helped me a lot! This game is worth getting. It deservers 5 stars!!!!!!&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;
A102KXC7ZQRJOO B00CB2837W 5 1369785600 49 This is a really great game I think is really fun. The bad part is that my game stopped working an  I need help to fix it amazon gave good advice but EA games makes it impossible to get help. You will like this game but not the service.
A102LAIS378AIA B00AREIAI8 1 1385337600 77 I really wish these &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; apps of the day would label themselves as what they really are: A Pay For Jems All The Time App. Because I'm used to appps moving in this &amp;#34;gems&amp;#34; direction, I really fail to see why My Horse is a game. Because the objective is NOT to level up or play the game, it's solely to spend hundreds of dollars leveing up that it's nearly impossible to do with regular game play.
A102LG1LA15ZZL B00F1XSETA 3 1382054400 21 The game is fine. It's hard and easy, so it's good. There's not much else to say. Well, that's my opinion.
A102LG1LA15ZZL B00FA6HWZU 4 1381708800 50 I think that Boo is a good game. It's simple and easy and great for kids ages 3-12. It won't keep you entertained for hours, but is nice for a little time waster. I personally just started playing today, but so far so good. I hope it stays that way!
A102LG1LA15ZZL B0058VW36U 4 1346544000 24 It was fun but eventually it became boring. other then that it was fun. It passes time. but like the title it was okay.
A102LG1LA15ZZL B006D1ONE4 5 1332547200 47 This game is great! It is so fun and challenging. But, it needs a update. But other than that it is awesome. Buy this app. You might think, don't get it, it costs money, but if you get it you'll see how fun it is. GET IT!!!!!
A102LG1LA15ZZL B008V06NRU 5 1380326400 37 I think &quot;Pou&quot; is a great game! If you're looking for a good game that's super fun, then you should play &quot;Pou&quot;! You get to take care of your own amazing alien pet! I totally recommend it!
A102LG1LA15ZZL B0097GVJWQ 3 1349654400 40 The game is okay. It's fun but a little to challenging. It should have more hints. Other then that it's okay but not THAT great or addicting. Like I said okay. If you like very hard mysteries I recommend this.
A102LG1LA15ZZL B00992CF6W 4 1383782400 54 It is so amazing, and so fun! I love it! The only reason I couldn't give it the 5th star, is because it glitched 3 times and shut my Kindle Fire HD&trade; down. Other than that, it is an extremely fun game! I recommend Minecraft, but be careful, 'cause it just might shut down.
A102LG1LA15ZZL B008RKNG88 2 1351728000 26 I bought this because it looked fun. But accually it's dumb. In the first mode if you flip, you lose. DUMB. The rest are just boring!
A102LG1LA15ZZL B00FAPF5U0 5 1382659200 30 REALLY! What took so long! I love Candy Crush! I play it all the time on my mom's phone, but it has finally come to Kindle, and I'm so happy!
A102M7IZD1A9G0 B004R49A4W 2 1337731200 95 As a birding reference this App gets good marks.  Bird facts and calls are both solid.  The problem is the unchangible font size.  On the Kindle there is no way to increase the font size for ease of field work -- where one would likely be changing focus from field glasses to the reference material.  The word &quot;Field Guide&quot; led me to believe I would be using this... well... in the field- which is next to impossible.  Serious downgrade for this deficit if you paid for the App. Still looking for a good field ref...
A102MSHXXB9F6L B008AIGWVA 5 1385078400 27 I just got this app today and after like two minutesi already love it .thank you talking friendsPs i also love talking tom i recommend that two
A102MSHXXB9F6L B00AA87JGU 5 1377648000 25 I have had strc throat four a week and had to miss school. This helped me to keep my brain thinking for when I return.
A102MSHXXB9F6L B008P1EWIM 5 1372896000 47 This app is the best weather app ever to be made. Weather live is so easy to understand. Every thing you want to know is right there in front of you.,like the temperature,the wind speed,the air pressure and etcI so suggest this app for you . Enjoy.
A102NBLSRXFFP1 B004SVMNXY 1 1333584000 27 This game is slow to respond and boring, and had an ad I would not want my children to see, so I installed it in record time.
A102NBLSRXFFP1 B0067R8JNK 5 1329004800 36 We love this game! It's fun to play alone and with others. My daughter and I love to play this together, with me looking on and she moves the letters, we figure it out and win!
A102NBLSRXFFP1 B0055DL1G4 1 1333756800 36 Just one word... why.These people should be put in jail (where they couldn't do any more damage), and sued for libel.It's beginning to look like old communist Russia, where the news outlets are mere propaganda machines.
A102NSR7T121R6 B0052UZIFA 3 1327881600 38 I know this is a good game i had it on my ipod do i downloaded it but WE NEED THE UPDATE!!!!!!!!! There isn't even a zen garden!!!!!! It would be 5 stars but there is no update!!!!
A102NSR7T121R6 B0067VKQLE 5 1324771200 29 Very fun.Adictiveness: 10/10Fun: 9.5/10Boring: 0/10Length: 8.3/10Awesomeness: 500/10!Should you buy? Definitely!Buy it!If you're still looking at my review and you haven,t bought it yet, you better buy it!Buy it noob!
A102NSR7T121R6 B0051W73RA 5 1324771200 30 This game is 100% stunning. Perfect graphics for the Kindle Fire. Full hd! Battle after battle, and each battle is intensely satisfying. Hours of fun gameplay! Totally worth the $2.99!
A102NSR7T121R6 B005ZUR724 5 1326153600 46 Don't pay attention to all the one star reviews. Those were before the game got the update. Great game if your a WoW or RuneScape fan. A lot of quests and a good fighting system. A lot like WoW, except much, much cheaper! Totally worth it!
A102PGKD8J5R2L B004SJ3BCI 1 1376697600 34 This app is listed as free but it gives you a free sample of the game.  If you want the full game you need to purchase it.  This fine, but don't say it's free.
A102PGKD8J5R2L B007NZV2HK 1 1376697600 25 Again , as with other apps I've downloaded, responses are slow,  Game itself is boring.  There really is nothing positive to say except nice colors.
A102UY1XH35DWR B00EOGZ42U 3 1389139200 71 This game is reasonably fun, there is a decent story driving it, it works well, it looks good, but its just so much work to play it.  There's a 1-2-3 speed rating and I can't imagine playing any slower than 3.  You end up having to take over 10 + planets and have to keep changing where they send their seedlings, and it takes so many 'clicks' to do all that...
A102UY1XH35DWR B00BWA8BAS 4 1378944000 58 Its a pretty good game, a little more random than I would really like.  Also there is absolutely no talking in the game, no clips from the voice actors, nothing, which seems kind of cheap.  It can get a little &#34;grindy&#34; towards the end, but thats pretty typical of launch games.  Runs great, great graphics, cute and fun.
A102UY1XH35DWR B006R8GK2Q 4 1340668800 25 Really didn't know what to expect and when I found out what the game play was, I almost quit. But it is somehow quite fun.
A102UY1XH35DWR B007VCVCAM 4 1335312000 20 perhaps the best way to describe this would be &quot;surprisingly fun&quot;.  needs more different things for garfield to say though
A102UY1XH35DWR B006MK63XK 2 1336348800 62 I've never played a game that so blatantly begged for you to give them money.  The 3rd level recommends a gun that costs $1000 more than you could possibly have. The 4th level wants a gun $1000 more than that.  Even the menus are hard to navigate due to all the ads and opportunities to buy their currency. Good concept, annoying execution.
A102UY1XH35DWR B0085PEG16 2 1357171200 97 I dunno, i clicked phaser and torpedo over and over, went to a space station for resupply, then went to the next battle and clicked phaser and torpedo over and over again and then went and resupplied againthere's no strategy, no surprises (really), no anything.  Then suddenly without any leadup it informed me via a message box that I had won and that i could restart at a higher difficulty - at which point the game crashedI would have given it one star, but the sound and graphics were nice, if not compleeeeeeeetely stolen from star trek
A102UY1XH35DWR B008AMNF3Y 2 1342742400 52 Most ads I've seen in a game. It blocks part of the game area so you can neither click nor see the bubbles you need to.  And there are full screen ads occasionally as well.Lastly it seems unusual that the levels are not strongly defined - they change every time they load.
A102UY1XH35DWR B005OYF3BS 4 1320364800 21 Fun but doesn't take long to get pretty hard.  Certainly worth playing. You do it. You do it. You do it.
A102UY1XH35DWR B009XFDFPU 4 1398816000 54 Too many people are complaining about the Facebook integration. It's really not that bad. Every few games it asks you to share some trophy in Facebook and you click the X and it goes away immediately. The game is staggeringly easy so far, but that's the only bad thing I can say about it
A102UY1XH35DWR B00910Y1OQ 4 1351468800 32 I dunno, I don't pay any attention to the story, and I don't get the point of tracing the little paths every few rounds, but the actual tile swapping game is good
A102UY1XH35DWR B0085YNML2 4 1389139200 66 This game is pretty fun, all the comparisons to Cut The Rope are apt and that is good company.  Maybe its just me, but when I started playing this, it seemed like a puzzle game where timing was not important and it was more about figuring out the order, but quickly became much more timing and movement oriented.  Just took some time to get used to.
A102UY1XH35DWR B0087EACJK 2 1365638400 52 To get 3 stars or whatever it is on each level you have to play through the level a few times to figure out what order to move the segments around in, then start playing it again trying to remember it all at high speeds, making the game feel like a chore
A102UY1XH35DWR B00AQCMK32 3 1388188800 92 The game is alright, I kept playing it, hoping I would find out what more there was to it. I'd previously played their soccer game, and that game made more sense, and incorporated some tiny amount of game play.This game is ploddingly slow, has numerous events you have to watch repeatedly and can't skip and doesn't explain enough about what's going on and how the game mechanics work.That said, I did play it pretty continuously for a few days because it is cute and I wanted to see how it turned out.
A102UY1XH35DWR B004HGK6FW 4 1329523200 21 Sudoku on the Nintendo DS is the best, but this is perfectly fine on the android.  Like all the configuration options
A102UY1XH35DWR B00AEL7M7E 5 1358726400 27 Same concept as Call of Atlantis, but feels a little tighter. In game explanation tells your ask you need to know and the story makes more sense
A102UY1XH35DWR B00DHQ0MGQ 5 1394668800 34 Similar game play to angry birds but way less repetitive. You don't just launch and hope, you usually get several throws power cat and helpful power ups and the graphics and sound are good.
A102UY1XH35DWR B006GIX2MI 4 1352419200 21 Pretty fun in its way. Not super clear always what is needed cuz everything's pretty small business a good time killer
A102UY1XH35DWR B004WPKENW 2 1316390400 28 Like I said.  Very good looking game, but I played it for 10 minutes, expecting to find a different game mode or anything and now am uninstalling it.
A102XPQQLIOTRZ B0097EWK3A 5 1374624000 27 Great game! Def worth the money! Nice combo of point and click with HO game. Play it peeps!! Plays well on kindle fire and graphics are superb.
A102XPQQLIOTRZ B00JQ8TQ1G 5 1402704000 67 This was a fun game. The graphics are well done, interesting, and add to the game's play. It plays very well on my kindle, has an easy mode and a challenging one. The story itself could have been more interesting, more adventurous and longer. This is the most expensive game I have bought to date and it shows in the graphics only. It is a good buy.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B005VTS4EY 5 1331337600 25 Thanks for the free app. Fun, fun, fun for a Saturday morning. What more could you ask for? Oh, yes a second cup of coffee.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B0088QDDDY 5 1348617600 28 Looks great on my Kindle Fire.  I played the game.  It was cute and I think my granddaughter will love this game. I am pleased with the FAOTD.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B00A3LSW7Y 5 1359590400 21 I can't put this puzzle down.  It is very entertaining.  The only annoying thing is the constant request for a review.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B007IUKQGS 5 1338508800 32 It is not an easy game. But I love a challenge and it's free.  Can't complain about that (well some people can). It's the perfect time to give this game a try.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B0069G5Z9K 5 1345334400 30 This game is so cool. I love the graphics and the controls work great. The game is really hard to put down. I can't believe it is free. Thanks Halfbrick!
A102Y9SVCWI737 B005Z4BGY0 5 1335571200 35 There is no better game for music lovers.  It makes me want to sing. &quot;I've Got The Music In Me&quot;. I can spend hours playing this game. The creator was right on with this game.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B006OOHVVC 5 1343260800 35 What fun! I love puzzles and this one is great.  No problems whatsoever on my Kindle Fire. The first thing I did was take someone's advice and turned off the facebook. Great FAOTD! Thanks Amazon!
A102Y9SVCWI737 B005MKRVLE 5 1340150400 24 I love Sudoku. Thanks for the FAOTD. Works great on my Kindle Fire but then all the apps I've tried works great on it.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B008J8OH5O 5 1358553600 26 Yahtzee works great on my Kindle Fire. Adding the 6th dice makes it more challeging and adds to the fun. Thanks for making it the FAOTD.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B005MSJ3DK 5 1348012800 24 This game works great on my Kindle Fire. The pictures look great too except for the spiders.  They're really ugly!  Thanks for the FAOTD.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B0089ZM1GY 5 1341446400 44 This is a fun and different game.  The graphics are great on my Kindle Fire.  I see the whiners are at it again. They're mad because of IAP. Get over it. This is a good app and it's the FAOTD.  Enjoy and be thankful!
A102Y9SVCWI737 B00840HIUS 5 1339286400 57 I don't care for bowling, so should I give this free app a bad review? What is wrong with you negative people? It states in the product description that you can buy extra content.  Why are you complaining? They gave you notice up front. If you don't want to buy extra content don't BUT stop the complaining.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B007375V4I 5 1340496000 55 The only problem I see with this app is the description does not include that Mash is a game for girls 12 - 16 yrs. old.  I remember playing it when I was that age and it was loads of fun.  Now it wouldn't be fun but that doesn't mean it is a bad game.
A102Y9SVCWI737 B007NZRKF8 5 1341619200 31 Plays great on my Kindle Fire.  Reminds me of Concentration many years ago onTV. The app downloaded quickly.  There are no bugs.  I have no complaints.  Its a relaxing FAOTD. Thanks!
A102Y9SVCWI737 B006P552CA 5 1336867200 41 I can understand critical reviews if you pay for an app but I don't understand critical reviews when it is free.  Also this is no place for your political view nor is it appreciated. This app is simple time killing fun.
A102YVT656CXUB B004TTY694 5 1355875200 20 Just what I wanted to record little pieces of information; free of a bunch of words, directions, or extra information.
A102YVT656CXUB B004VMUS9G 5 1380499200 25 Does everything: timer, alarm, stop watch, and desk top. The alarm is not real loud but maybe that is in my settings skill. Try it!
A102YVT656CXUB B00AFCEIB0 4 1376265600 26 I like it and I really like Google Chrome. The search bar comes up immediately and I do not have to guess where the icon is.
A102Z9CFJOOZAY B004V6K38I 1 1343606400 20 This was a great app until the last update.  Now it force closes every single time.  What is going on?
A102Z9CFJOOZAY B006C4U9RW 4 1384128000 52 This is a great music app.  I have been using it off and on for a while now.  The only reason I didn't rate it a 5/5 is that I wish there were more Messianic artists on here and a few times I've tried to search for an artist they aren't listed.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B009UX2YAC 5 1384992000 20 It's a fun game to play. Keeps you occupied when your upset and don't want to start yelling. Good game.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B00B7PKAKC 5 1379203200 27 For better fun please put the Ray gun from zombies on ZRT this means Call of Duty Plus the game ULTRA AWESOME WHEN BOUGHT. ALSO THE THUNDERGUN
A1035QR1WGB6PO B009LFGG76 3 1381017600 45 Crosswords are for strengthening your memory and eye coordination and this game certainly does. It's an easy game for when your bored but your mind won't stop thinking. I prefer to do puzzles when I'm hung out and dead tired but need something to do.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B0063GORYU 4 1382140800 31 I love this version of spider solitare because of the graphics and the on  tap card options. It's a nice  game to play on a rainy day or just to relax.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B004HE5TAG 5 1379980800 21 This game is cool. The graphics are pretty awesome. To all the card game junkies this is the game for you.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B00CKW6FVE 4 1398470400 47 I enjoy playing Tetris Blitz. Well once i figured out how to achieve high scores and how to use the power ups. The music was entertaining and different from the original Tetris game. If you like stacking blocks and distroying them this game you will surely enjoy.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B00DVKOYBM 4 1398556800 32 I like this pool app its competitive and fun with interacting opponents. I like playing with other nationalities. Get to see many different names and how they spell. Just and interesting experience.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B006KX3GXO 4 1384214400 23 I am an artist at heart and enjoy all these fascinating pictures everyone uploads so anyone  can witness the figures that enchant them.
A1035QR1WGB6PO B0091SUMB4 4 1397692800 47 This is a cute app I have come across so far. As the information on this signal booster says it does follow through with it's blunt and truthful details. I recommend this app because of the graphics and how well it straighten your WiFi connection. Have fun.
A1036NNLQBDXDP B00594XOZU 5 1402358400 32 I love this app, it rarely freezes up and never shuts down. you can message any one of your friends that have the same app. it works great on kindle fire too.
A1036NNLQBDXDP B006VXRNYG 5 1329782400 21 better than any other drawing app because you can use your FINGERNAIL ha awesome you should download this app right away
A1036NNLQBDXDP B00702PZME 5 1331683200 42 download it but if you don't want to see a nasty profile picture of someone don't really i was playing a game with this guy and his profile picture was a picture of his private area... but still its a great app
A1036NNLQBDXDP B0070O973K 1 1331510400 38 It is stupid as Poo lol g g g g g g g g f f f f d s s d s s s d ff r r r ev j k j k Uk j kcjckcj
A1036NNLQBDXDP B005LIYX5Y 5 1330473600 20 the beast of apps. DOWNLOAD IT.. my dad and mom downloaded it and they even love it and its FREE
A10389WSMBPCYR B00E8KLWB4 5 1378684800 96 Like this a lot. It took me some time to get into it because the items r very hidden which makes it almost too challenging at first but once u give it time and patience it gets addictive. It also took time to figure out all the tools and how they work and I think there are way way way too many words but I found that if u actually read them it can be helpful although I still think I am probably missing a lot due to not fully understanding the game but still fun.
A10389WSMBPCYR B008N04TMO 4 1388275200 48 This version is better than the first in that u can zoom in a little  further. Challenging but not too much to be frustrating.  I like  it but I don't think it's worth the  cost even though I paid  it. Would be 5 stars if not so expensive.
A10389WSMBPCYR B0097EWK3A 5 1375747200 27 Great game. This is the ONLY game  I have ever purchased cuz I don't buy games but it was so worth it. Can  wait  for  the  sequel!!
A10389WSMBPCYR B00CT9ZVGI 5 1395705600 24 avid HO player - this game is one of the best!  Great story, great graphics and length of game is worthy. Buy it now.
A10389WSMBPCYR B007XKEY6Q 3 1381449600 62 Does anyone else experience technical difficulties with ads? I don't mind them cuz game is free but there is no menu option to skip them on some (most)  which forces me to click on them and then the app crashes. Anyone else have this problem? It's a huge bummer and nuisance. I have the Kindle Fire HD. Fix this problem please? Thanks!!
A10389WSMBPCYR B00K7C17QW 3 1402531200 84 Everyone has the same complaint so hoping the developers pay attention and make some improvements and soon. If you read reviews on their site or Facebook page, we are all saying the same thing.... the wait time for energy reload is ludicrous. Also since its new not many Facebook friends are playing yet so it would be nice if the system would allow an additional method to add friends to help with the energy wait issue. Good game  but needs some reworking for energy.
A103C3F5TM3NX7 B00AE9UYJ4 5 1372291200 41 This game is pretty awesome. If you don't like coffee and you can't wake. Then play this game. Most likely. With a friend. And if you really want to wake then play on hard. I haven't beat hard yet. =(  =]
A103C3F5TM3NX7 B00B2V66VS 5 1359158400 34 This game is the best game in the world!!!!! Way better then the first one. Which is still awesome!!!! This is a super fun game..sometimes hard but you can easily adapt to the difficulty
A103C3F5TM3NX7 B00992CF6W 5 1361923200 114 Do you like games that you can't stop playing? Then get minecraft. I also recomemd minecraft world editor it is cool too. Minecraft is always getting updates so the game just keeps getting better and better. If you had a choice between minecraft PE(pocket addition) and minecraft computer version. Then get the computer version it is better because thats what minecraft is suppose to go on. The version i am on is 0.6.1 you will most likely be reading this some time in the future. Of any one has something bad to say about minecraft then you should see you-tube videos about the awesome things people do with it. I hope you enjoy minecraft.
A103C3F5TM3NX7 B00ANUMR1W 5 1359417600 23 This game is best for those who like a challenge it is a good game but i could barley get passed leval two
A103HQ12X7S6QZ B004WOXGCO 5 1334793600 23 this was the free app of the day a while back.  so glad I downloaded it.  very useful and I use it daily
A103HQ12X7S6QZ B004L24888 5 1329609600 23 its ok to me I sort of like it. some r kind of funny. people work hard to make these kind of games
A103HQ12X7S6QZ B007581DPQ 5 1331078400 20 my daughter loves this game. she loves how you get to find all of these different games. fun fun fun!
A103HU7CY2MGCT B009PCBEPE 3 1363824000 62 This is a much better version than the original one. Some of the scenarios are very difficult, but that's part of the charm. My complaint is that when the ads pop up and you hit the x to get rid of it, the gun fires. That should be reprogrammed to fix this issue. Otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating.
A103HU7CY2MGCT B008JJS6D2 1 1358985600 85 The problem is that it hangs up way too often, ruining the fun. Also when playing more than 1 card, the rest of the cards are just too small. This game has great potential, if they would fix the issues.EDIT:It finally got to the point where it would not even work at all, and I removed it. This program has potential, but it needs a lot of tuning up. As a result, I am rescinding my 3 stars and lowering it to a 1 star.
A103HU7CY2MGCT B009HQ9UHC 5 1360281600 51 This time wasting app is an enjoyable pastime when you have nothing else to do. It will challenge your creativity by coming up with various ways to accomplish the goals. The thing that struck as soon as I started the app, was the catchy theme song. Try it, you'll like it.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B0066TUXU6 5 1368144000 38 I love hulu, and I love that I can use it in more than one place now, it's perfect for my kindle, and the kindle screen is so much better to use this app on then the iphone.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B006MH1A1S 4 1361750400 50 This game is totally addicting for me on my kindle, but at the same time it like never ends. It can get pretty repetitive, but it is one of those games that you want to play when you want to just not think about anything, and it's perfect for that.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B009PSV1HE 5 1367712000 122 I've always been a big fan of Diner Dash, I have played it for many years on my various computers throughout the years. But when I got my Kindle Fire I saw that there was an app for Diner Dash on it I was a bit leary about how well it would work in the table format. I love playing this game, even on the tablet. The only thing that is tricky on the app is getting the right colored people into the right colored seats to get the color match bonus. But that can also be tricky with a standard mouse as well, so I would highly recommend to anyone who has played this game before to buy the app form.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B00BUQBQN8 5 1393459200 41 One of the better Etsy apps I have seen, it's easy to use and easy to search for things. Plus I love using it on my kindle since the screen is so much bigger than me using it on my phone.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B0094BB4TW 5 1368144000 23 I bought this when the facebook app I had been using stopped working, but this app worked great and I like using it.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B00H51RUZK 3 1398988800 39 There are a lot of youtube apps for tablets and phones, and this one just didn't work as seamless as some of the other options out there. It gets the job done, but definitely isn't my go to choice.
A103KWX1QFCG6I B007SYDYLS 2 1361750400 49 Games are really subjective, but this game just didn't do it for me. It just really wasn't fun for me to play, I didn't feel like i could play it for a long period of time or anything. Maybe other people will enjoy playing it, I however did not.
A103OC11B1MKF2 B00BNH1PF8 5 1397865600 39 love this game so much I will play it all night if I could to bad my kindle battery only last for four hours love this game soooooooo muuuuchhhhhh I was really fell in lo e with this game
A103OC11B1MKF2 B00K7C17QW 5 1402012800 23 this ids a awesome hams I just love it it reminds me of svu I just love it so so so so much
A103OC11B1MKF2 B00B5DLSMU 5 1395705600 33 I stayed up all night pl&agrave;ying this.game it is so much fun I cant believe people wouldn't like this game anyway hatred will be hatred a ruzlers will be ruzlers $%&amp;* peace out
A103OC11B1MKF2 B00IZLM8MY 5 1397952000 25 this game is amazing. jillian and I are dating love this game you are match maker you get to pick the choices liv for life
A103SDDMENAXQH B009G9KFQ0 5 1390348800 24 i check this app every day to see how to dress and plan my day. love this little bug couldnt get dressed without it
A103SDDMENAXQH B005OQJG0K 1 1379548800 21 the only wifi it found was the one set up in my own home I deleted it. Dont recommend this one
A103T4L14A5O42 B006GHY9C6 3 1322956800 44 I dug the game to start, but soon found out that if you don't follow their pre-determined placements, you will fail or come close. No imagination allowed, and the restrictions on units later in the game bummed me out. 3 stars on Kindle Fire.
A103T4L14A5O42 B0066TUXU6 5 1322265600 131 NOTE: You must be a subscriber to Hulu+ in order to benefit from this app. Regular Hulu is free and has a limited although nice selection, and Hulu+ offers a much wider selection at only around $8 a month (I forget how much off the top of my head). We use Hulu+ on our XBox360, so having it accessible on my Fire as well is awesome.The interface is easy enough to use, and I like being able to split between 'episodes' for shows and 'movies' in my queue to make things easier to find. My only complaint at this point is that it doesn't do well for remembering your account, so logging in every few days stinks, but for a free app I can't ding my rating for something so small.
A103T4L14A5O42 B005V20JKI 4 1322006400 46 I like to putz around on games like this from time to time, and it works pretty well on the Kindle Fire. Controls can be a bit annoying at times, but the game is simple fun, so I just brush it off and just play on.
A103X973HANNID B00J206J5E 4 1396483200 45 It ok, but not the best G5  game I've played .I really missed the map telling me where I'm at. Hard to find your  way around . The puzzles are goog. It's entertaining. Except for trying to figure out where  I  am it's been fun.
A103X973HANNID B00ATDOVNK 5 1392595200 36 Most of the G-5  games are very entertaining. The grafics are  wild ,and so much more advanced there's no comparison. I really like the map that tell me where  I  am and where the action is!
A103YSNT9P6XHK B00CXP63BK 5 1373846400 25 This game is really fun...It looks like 3D too. Get it if you haven't already. Its fun and free. Cant get much better than that!
A103YSNT9P6XHK B0086700CM 4 1367798400 20 This game if fun if your bored. Its a challenging and fun game. You should buy it..if you haven't already
A103YSNT9P6XHK B00CZDSK7K 4 1370476800 21 This a good game....The only promblem is..its a little complicated. I hope you get it..its free any way. Just try it!!!!!
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B00881VLCE 4 1404259200 41 You have a beautiful selection of puzzles. Your app is also easy to use. My only suggestion would be to get rid of the cost of additional puzzles and give them as rewards after completing the selection the app comes with.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B00702PZME 5 1329264000 28 Very easy to use and fun. Each game is quick, and the word combinations are sometimes surprising. This is an app for any one who likes word games.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B00DT4GRTM 3 1379376000 57 This has an interesting take on an old game. I like the concept and it's fun to play. The reason I gave it only 3 stars for two reasons; one problem is there is not enough pay out or daily bonus and two the game as it is is just too hard to win. It needs fixed.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B00FAPF5U0 3 1384041600 26 I love this game but sometimes it clicks off before the end of the round and usually it is when I have several bongos. Please help.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B00B2TET3C 4 1379462400 24 You have  done a nice job on this version of bingo. Fun for the whole family. I like the look of the game also.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B00B4G3MV8 1 1370476800 29 Seriously? No Dish network? Screw this app then no wonder hbo is so much better. I'll stick with the hbogo app they don't discriminate against cable companies. Screw Showtime.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B0063GORYU 4 1329177600 21 Good App, easy to use and works as it should. If you like Spider Solitare this is the app for you.
A103ZIBLZNEYAF B007XF3WFA 5 1336435200 27 I love it. The association gets harder as go a long. Lots of fun. I go through the themes so quickly that I wish there were more.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B007D3BQY6 3 1349136000 60 one if you really sit and think you can come to a solution about any dream they just reflect life so why would you ask someone else to tell you about your own life. two funny how there were so many one star ratings in a row then so many five star ratings in a row just makes ya think
A103ZLCK07SBFS B008FRFN7A 5 1349136000 54 I have a kindle fire and I have looking for an app to print from it ever since I have got and this is the only one I have got to work and the best part this one is free! I wish I would of found this one before I paid for other apps.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B008IJT0CE 5 1369699200 61 I have never seen so many sounds in one app before. Plus the sound quality is great. You can mix any number of them, as well as adjust the volume for each one. I was just going through all of the different sounds and I was ready to go to bed. Very soothing. I would recommend to anyone of any age.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B004SH9JSU 1 1348358400 39 wow big red flag!! just reading all that it needs access to makes me not want to even touch this app it just looks like it wants get all of your info. I would stay away from this one
A103ZLCK07SBFS B008245WE0 1 1344902400 79 I downloaded this because I love the sound of the rain, but I found this app to be very stupid and not well put together. No matter how fast or slow you make the rain  or how big or small you make the drops the sound of the 'so called' rain does not change. To me it sound like nothing more than running water going down a drain. Also when the drops hit the screen is not very realistic.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B007TBAQCK 4 1336176000 87 well what is there to say it is a virtual slot machine you are destine to lose but it fun to play mainly because its not real money, though you can if you want to. I do like all of the different slot games just sucks you have to unlock them and do not like that you have to cycle through bet amounts instead of being able to go up and down. also had to force close a few times. I would recommend this game to anyone.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B0063IH60K 5 1336953600 21 I have played other solitaire games and I must say I like this one best. I really enjoy the winning hands.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B0050KDTSK 5 1330992000 20 This game is so additive! It is my new favorite game. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone. :)
A103ZLCK07SBFS B009P8EMCK 4 1353456000 68 this has all of the cartoons you can watch on pbs. some of the videos are full episodes and some are just clips. i feel that the videos take a bit too long to load, this is directed for young children and anyone with children know that they can have short attention spans at times so waiting a long time for the video to load can cause issues
A103ZLCK07SBFS B009ZS2B28 1 1354838400 22 not really fun to play bingo by yourself :( not challenging at all that way also not to mention boring zero excitement
A103ZLCK07SBFS B0054JZC6E 2 1326412800 21 I played the game once then uninstalled it. Not challenging at all just annoying really, but that is just my opinion.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B009WJNXAE 4 1356048000 65 if you have ever played bingo blitz this is a lot like that. I must say I like bingo blitz better because with this game if you do not sign in with face book you have limited game play. it is nice that you actually play against real people, but if I were going to get a bingo game I would download bingo blitz instead.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B009KS4XRO 5 1375401600 37 I have played other bingo games and not one has even come close to this one. I like all of the options that are available. I feel that this game is the best bingo game out there.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B007581DPQ 5 1331942400 48 This is a very cute game. My two year old loves it.  Just wish it had more 'spotisodes' after a bit it gets boring doing the same ones over and over again, but other than that I would recommend this game to anyone, especially if you like VeggieTales.
A103ZLCK07SBFS B007PW1BRC 4 1334016000 28 first time ever playing phase 10 I really enjoyed the game just sucks that it is really only a preview of the real game but it was free
A103ZLCK07SBFS B00AQX1KFU 1 1363824000 28 There is really on this app. But if you are willing to pay $6.99 then it might be worth it. But as is not worth even messing with.
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00BUIPN62 1 1388534400 21 I think this is a very stupid game. I am glad it was free.I think this is just really corny game.
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00AMR1HZ8 5 1388534400 25 Wheel of Fortune is challenging and fun. I love word games and this is my favorite. I play it a lot. It is totally addicting.
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00FX6ZBXC 5 1399766400 126 This game is a lot of fun.I like the fact that there are different levels.So when I am tired I can play an easy game and when I want a challenge I play a harder level. I usually play one of the Wombats instead of a human person mainly because it takes to long between turns. I played someone recently and we were almost finished and the person left. So I felt it was a waste of time. The graphics for this game are really cute.A lot like Scrabble which I have always loved.I love to play all kinds of word games and I am always looking for something new and different. Anyways this is one of my favorite s. So relax and enjoy your self....
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00BX42FLY 3 1397779200 31 I think this game is a pretty good game. I enjoy trying to figure out the connection.Some of the puzzles are very challenging others are very simple.I would recommend  this game.
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00A6W03Z4 5 1388534400 65 If you are a fan of Price is Right you will love this game. It has the games from the. 1970s to present day. Some of the older games from the 1970's and 1980's are a little difficult. I do not remember the cost of things back then.I really enjoy this game and I think if you are a fan you will enjoy it too.
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00FAPF5U0 2 1387238400 41 I have been stuck on the same level for weeks now and no longer want to play. Have gotten bored. I loved this game at first. I have many other games that are fun like Papa Pears and Animal Farm Heroes....
A1041U0YUV8B4B B00AEWUQG2 5 1388534400 39 I like this game a lot. It is a fast moving game and very challenging. I used to love the TV show and it is played similar to that.If you enjoy Trivia you will have fun with this game.
A1043W70WOBDDP B00KWVZ750 1 1403395200 21 They nickel and dime you to death. Updates wipe out everything you have and send back to the basics. Not recommended!
A1043W70WOBDDP B00F8GYC1Y 5 1380585600 26 AWESOME!!! If you love angry birds, then you will love this game. A little short but very fun. You will never go wrong with angry birds!
A1043W70WOBDDP B009HKL4B8 4 1367452800 43 All around great gameplay. Some task's take way to long....several hours. Very little money is generated and you need way to much to spend. They need to increase our SIM pay or decrease how much things cost. I still would recommend this game.
A10477HYDC0B71 B00ASSF19Y 5 1357689600 31 It was good because it lets your creativity explode and you get to mix and match clothes &amp; I really think it was a wonderful idea for whoever created the game.
A10477HYDC0B71 B00AK0DFDY 5 1357171200 37 I thought it was good because you get to pick her outfits.  I think that it's good to let you're creativity spill into you're own outfit that if you want you can make it. PLEASE MAKE MORE!!!!!
A10477HYDC0B71 B00AMRIZYY 5 1358467200 22 I think that it was good because it lets you create her outfits and you can make a wonderful idea of curiosity.
A10477HYDC0B71 B00AJ8SRFI 5 1358467200 44 It was good because it lets you make a wonderful idea of curiosity and you can make a difference between the two of the outfits and you can make a small amount of curiosity about the game and that is why it was good.
A10477HYDC0B71 B00AP9U8SA 5 1357776000 40 I think it's good because it lets you're creativity explode and you can mix &amp; match her outfits and you can make a wonderful idea of curiosity and you can make a small amount of time to play this game.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B005AJ6ISO 5 1392249600 27 I find it very nice to get your day started  with a verse to go by in the day to get you started. And all day long
A104EJFDIR2C7R B00CO6TOBY 4 1376956800 20 I like it , its different then that I am use to. but I enjoy it on my down time.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B00A4EZ3QS 1 1368230400 32 I fine this hard to play  I did what they told me and I still lost. I will play it again to try it but I don't know what else to do.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B00FAPF5U0 5 1389571200 34 I love playing the game. If I could beat it that would be great. I play it once a day I try as much as it would let me. It is lots of fun.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B0096DFY5S 2 1362182400 25 I don't like it because it keeps shuting down on me. I even try to buy it new again to see if that would work
A104EJFDIR2C7R B004DLNC4I 1 1353024000 50 I didn't like it it didn't work right. I took it off of my kindle right away.Couldn't hear it right.  I like something I can enjoy listing to,  I think you need to improve this app. maybe some day I will get it again, when I am sure it works
A104EJFDIR2C7R B00A3XR6HO 5 1373500800 62 Its lots of fun. I have to be on my toes to play its a fast moving game. But I love it, when I need time to sit down I look forward to playing it .I first played it on facebook and loved it so I got it on my kindle, so I didn't have to be on the cumputer to play.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B009EEFTMC 4 1362182400 23 Its fun and it causees you to solve it  and part of it takes fast action  it relaxes me. after a busy day
A104EJFDIR2C7R B005V5WBFG 1 1377302400 22 It won't start on my kindle. I have nothing but trouble try to put it on for security. I'm still not covered.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B009G41CG2 4 1362182400 30 I like this  It takes me time to get through it  it what I'm looking for. to try to  fine the answersI like the ones it takes time to solve.
A104EJFDIR2C7R B009WJNXAE 1 1380931200 20 I never got it on my kindle. I  never saw it on my kindle and I don't under stand it
A104EWQVOUULCY B0066T0EVE 3 1365724800 20 its ok not that good not very good graphics. did Dixie dud did did did did did did did did
A104FCG1K79TQE B006OCM0G0 4 1351728000 20 Great game. Get it. All that needs to be said. Add me ID: TagnetUnicorn, like I said it is addicting.
A104FCG1K79TQE B00AREIAI8 5 1362700800 40 seems pretty legit. got it for my 4yr old niece but now I don't even want her to play it. she could mess up my horse haha. get it its free delete it if you hats it. simple as that
A104FCG1K79TQE B00A7ICO7C 3 1354492800 28 I play pet shop, night club, restaurant,  fashion, and bakery storehouse and bakery is my least favorite. but I still play it so its good I guess. :)
A104FCG1K79TQE B00COVCV50 4 1371513600 36 this game seems pretty easy right now but im only on level 21. i have seen on facebook people get up to like level 135 so ill keep going to see. pretty good. concentration required game.
A104HHVVMF2GR B004LZIZHU 5 1367366400 23 my 4 and 6 yr old girls love this game. I know adults and kids who play it.. Fun for the whole family!!!
A104HHVVMF2GR B00AIUUXHC 5 1367366400 39 I'd recommend this game to anyone! It's fun and challenging. My husband and I play it all the time and my 6 yr old is even getting good at it! It's a great game with awesome graphics. LOVE IT
A104HHVVMF2GR B005OYF3BS 5 1361145600 28 I enjoy playing this, and so do my young children. My 3 and 5 yr old girls play it more than me and love it! Great free app!
A104HHVVMF2GR B005ZXWMUS 5 1361145600 57 Can't live without it! I love being able to watch things on my kindle when stuck in waiting rooms, etc.This comes in so handy! Also I can watch when in bed not feeling well or on a car ride, and other times when not by a tv or unable to have my laptop with me. Highly recommend!
A104HHVVMF2GR B004ANMWPY 5 1367366400 20 Love the color codes for shows, sports, movies. I always use this app. saves time flipping through commercials! Time saver!
A104IPS8AYAOK5 B00ET0PZDO 4 1389312000 20 Rooms are all different as well as the clues. Graphics are cool! adjust figurevout what you need and find it.
A104IPS8AYAOK5 B0097EWK3A 4 1396396800 25 Game graphics were nice and the plot was interesting.  I love these kind of games and enjoy solving things.  Clues are useful when you're stuck.
A104IPS8AYAOK5 B00FGFVMGA 5 1385942400 33 This game was fun to play! The graphics are nice and the clues make you think. Went and downloaded The Lost City, which is another game by them that is just as fun.
A104IPS8AYAOK5 B0055SWM08 5 1334620800 22 This game works great on my Kindle Fire. It quietly lulls you into playing it more. The music is nice and mellow.
A104KP9O6Y8BZY B0062QUNHG 5 1357344000 30 This is a wonderful ap. It is exactly like the monthly booklet except better. There are links to bible verses. On the ipod ap there is audio if you wish.
A104KP9O6Y8BZY B006PJ3UKC 3 1357344000 24 The articles are very limited. I do like looking at the daily news articles that they do show. I wish there was more content.
A104KP9O6Y8BZY B0094BB4TW 3 1357344000 68 I'm glad that I have this ap it is handy to check your facebook account. The screen is touchy making it hard to navigate. It jumps all over. When I scroll down it jumps back to the top or you find yourself in places that you didn't want to go. It doesn't compare to being on a computer but again it is good for a quick check in.
A104M9RYHPSJLI B00AMEFZ72 3 1398556800 24 Good game. Wish it was easier to get coins though. Did pretty well with the slots at first and now can't get any coins.
A104M9RYHPSJLI B00ANUMR1W 4 1357516800 25 Very fun game and free. Give it a try you wont be disapoonted. May not be for everyone but worth a try at this price.
A104M9RYHPSJLI B0080K98U0 5 1357516800 46 I have played this game off and on for a year or so now. Its a fun waste of time. Great hack and slash game with some rpg elements sprinkled in. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes hack and slash and/or rpg games.
A104NFSMP1JXHT B004N2NWQ0 5 1383436800 28 when I had a Nabi , this app was on there .now that I know its on here , it creeps me out.it just wow`s me a lot.
A104NFSMP1JXHT B00FRQ32N4 5 1386720000 20 Awesome game. It's the best of all the real steal games. Way better than the  other real steal games. Awesome.
A104NFSMP1JXHT B00E3CFTJS 5 1381276800 23 It` awesome. It's kind of like Percy Jackson monsters. It is also like Dragon Vale. Or dragon story which are both great games.
A104NFSMP1JXHT B007ZGO7EM 5 1389398400 26 this app is so awesome!!! Whenever I need that its there , I just absolutely love this app . its always  there fir me !!!!!  :-)
A104QGECCAFCI9 B00EW3STPY 5 1390435200 44 My 4 yr old loves puzzles and he loves Caillou so this was an easy pick.  I was worried it wouldn't stand up to his interest, but it does.  Nicely done with different levels of puzzles and ability to go from scene to scene.
A104QS6M66L388 B0051UP5NQ 1 1328659200 46 I love that it autosaves files. But it doesn't do it that often. By that, I mean it force closes on me as I'm taking notes in class more than it autosaves. What a pain in my arse. There's better office/document programs for Android out there.
A104QS6M66L388 B004SDSSFY 5 1328659200 74 While other apps force close half the time while I'm taking notes in class - this doesn't. I love it on my tablet (Acer A500) and it's been good. It also has an option to synch files with your desktop/laptop, but I find it easier to just use DropBox. I also love the formatting that you can do with this (bullet points. indenting, etc.) I mainly use it for word and it works great.
A104RBWVISRIUF B0087SGWI6 3 1354838400 56 I like playing but there are major glitches in the scoring and recording of scores. when I wanted to check my score against others ' I got the message 'too busy ' then another time it would not give my score so I could compare. I think this could be a 5 star ap with corrections.
A104RBWVISRIUF B004RCD7NY 3 1337558400 26 As I was scrolling theo the app froze. I truer again and it froze again. Might be a good app but if I can't use it....
A104RBWVISRIUF B00BGC5UAG 3 1366761600 69 Initially this app was easy then quickly went to an adult level in word selection. As I was guessing it asked me immediately if I wanted to upgrade to the paid app with more clues. So much for a free app! Will be uninstalling this as it said I had earned many helps,  but they are unobtainable. Would have loved to play more but refuse to pay for clues!
A104RLAA2X4C92 B00850NK6I 4 1388448000 73 The reading interface is not nearly as nice as the kindle reading application, but I love that I can listen to audiobooks.  I use my libraries elibrary loan website to borrow audiobooks, and listen to them using this application.  It works like a charm.  The application isn't the easiest to navigate, but it is awesome for browsing my library's website and downloading books.  I do prefer to read books using kindle format though.
A104RLAA2X4C92 B005ZXWMUS 5 1388448000 24 Love the Netflix app.  Takes forever to stream movies if on slower Internet though.  Great for kindle.  I have a kindle fire hd 7&#34;
A104RLAA2X4C92 B0064X7B4A 3 1388448000 46 This works so poorly for kindle.  I hate the look of it.  I have played words with friends on my iPhone for several years and perhaps that has spoiled me, but something was just missing with the kindle app.  Still plays the game, but looks dreadful
A104RLAA2X4C92 B0051UP5NQ 3 1388448000 67 I like that I can make word documents on my kindle.  I got the application on sale, but if I hadn't, I would be extremely angry about the fact that the application doesn't come with fonts by default.  As I got in on sale, I won't gripe too much, but seriously, they make you purchase a separate application to add a few various other fonts---kind of ridiculous
A104WNTOWZS6HU B0078TD3HI 5 1330646400 26 this app is awesome I can not stop playing it I am a five star baby very great app you get to roll jump and more
A104WNTOWZS6HU B00B20CMJE 5 1360454400 43 this game is a awesome game on kindle fire works perfect all my other games LAG that stinks but its ok and I got this game in 2013 whoo hoo NEW WORLD anyways I think u should get it its really cool game.
A104WNTOWZS6HU B009ZKSPDK 5 1359158400 25 it is awesome I bought it in 2013 I hve the demo that was pretty cool but it has time limit that's pretty boring though.
A104WNTOWZS6HU B004SJ3BCI 5 1331424000 29 this app is beast I beat it I love the black angry bird that is the bomb fuzz it exploads that's my favrite and all of the strychnine birds
A104XY683HNK5D B009ZE27US 1 1355961600 25 DO NOT BUY THIS IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND DOESNT EVEN TELL YOU THE RIGHT AGE THIS IS A FAKE OF AN APP
A104XY683HNK5D B007HH3K5G 5 1331769600 29 this game is theeeeeee best i love animals and this is one of the many ways that you can take care of them!!! Every day i play this game.
A104XY683HNK5D B00BG3ID0Y 5 1364947200 20 I'm only rating because I get 160 coins if I do but otherwise its a great time killing game!! bujlfjfjf
A104XY683HNK5D B0086700CM 5 1343088000 20 i love it its very addictive. i reccomended it to mmu mom now she wont get off her phone hahahahaha
A104XY683HNK5D B00529IOXO 3 1363651200 32 this app is great and easy besides the delay on popup messages and the fact you cant make or enter a community anymore that's sad that's how I met my best friend!
A104XY683HNK5D B009HKL4B8 5 1361750400 70 some people ask is there a place you don't have to pay rent on a house...... and uh yes there is its called the Sims ....but sorry in real life you still have to pay rent :( but otherwise this is the only game I can keep up with. its fun, short timing, takes your mind off things, very easy, and you can connect with friends how cool is that?
A104XY683HNK5D B00B2V66VS 5 1359244800 31 I am purchasing it now! ive played on my friends game before and it was the best thing ever cant wait for it to completely download!!! gonna be on it 24/7
A104XY683HNK5D B006OCM0G0 5 1331251200 24 i absolutely love this game i just love it. it is fun and adicting u should get this game if you don't have it
A104XY683HNK5D B008JK6W5K 5 1352592000 20 I absolutely love it....it is very tricky though so watch yoself haha have fun I know I did lolz bye!!
A1050FV5E5MFO B00FN811SY 5 1395273600 20 Love it...the pics in the appendix and the interactivity of this app makes it the best! LOVE it! Thank You!
A1050FV5E5MFO B006RMJ1I2 2 1332115200 77 This works great if your writing down 1 or 2 words at a time, but it never picked up a complete sentence correctly- it was terrible with picking out the words I was writing.  And even then, the only time it got a word correct is if I slowly wrote the word out like I was just learning the alphabet- one letter ... s-l-o-w-l-y  at a time.  Uninstalling and still looking for a great note-taking app =(
A1050FV5E5MFO B0054JZC6E 3 1325203200 78 This would be a 5 star app if it wasnt' for all the advertisements- and the possibility to accidently hit the "Buy" button on the main screen. Even for a free app it's just too much- the advertiseing is all over the place! The games are fun and short, so I am going to have to look into the paid version to see if I can like it anymore than I do already- thus 3 stars so far.
A1050FV5E5MFO B004UHSB5A 2 1329868800 44 I downloaded it even though it had bad reviews. it played fine for me on my fire, but as otheres have said the tiles are way too small.  they snapped in place with little effort though. I got a headache..uninstalled due to tiny tiles...
A1050FV5E5MFO B006PHD0RW 5 1329177600 73 This is a very good game!  I get more and more impressed with the type of games coming out for these types of devices!  I'm a gamer that has the PS3, xBox 360, Wii, and PSP, so I get a little skeptical when it comes to what you call "game" apps.  This one takes all the negative thoughts away.  Great game play- great graphics... I would pay for it if it wasn't free!
A1050FV5E5MFO B006VW94HQ 5 1332115200 33 I tested out the free version and liked it so much I went ahead and bought it. Sometimes the word matches are easy, and some make u think.  Its worth the .99 cents.
A1050FV5E5MFO B006RAX9OQ 2 1325203200 119 This is the first app that has completely frozen my fire!  I played 1 game and now I can't even turn my Fire off to reset it...Don't know what to do with it now- maybe let the battery die?  I plugged it into the PC with a USB and the PC sees it- but nothing appears on my Kindle screen?  I wouldn't trust this!Edit- Ok, the 20 seconds of holding the power button reset the Fire and now all is well.  I uninstalled this game to be safe- which is unfortunate because it was fun while it lasted.  I really wish it wouldn't have locked everything up- I would have kept it and given it a higher rating :(
A105188E1HFWRX B0098BGYM0 5 1376006400 20 Ok, so I haven't actually started using it yet, but I'm sure that it will be very helpful in school.
A105188E1HFWRX B00JTKDTLE 5 1401321600 23 It is extremely hard to believe how addicting this game is, it is so simple, but it's just so hard to put down.
A105188E1HFWRX B00B7ERH04 3 1376006400 21 Not the best camera in the world. The camera that comes in the diary app is better. But not too bad
A105188E1HFWRX B00CO52NLI 3 1376006400 28 It's good I haven't played it yet though it seems a little bit on the boring side. Ya have to buy a lot of the a animals too
A105288HLH1QD2 B00B2V66VS 4 1376438400 24 it would be Amazing but it glitches sometimes. I love the new tracks and the way you can get gems... definitely worth four stars
A105288HLH1QD2 B00769WNK8 5 1330560000 33 I got this app because all of the reveiws say it is awesome and they are right!  I love this game works fine on my kindle and never has trouble.  THIS APP ROCKS!!!!!
A105288HLH1QD2 B00AREIAI8 5 1362787200 21 I love this it is a great game for a horse lover and it works almost perfectly even with no wifi
A105288HLH1QD2 B0054JZC6E 5 1325289600 26 I like this app because when I have to share my kindle. fire with my sisters that is fun enough that they don't do anything else.
A105288HLH1QD2 B007VUA7VO 5 1348444800 26 this is a very good app for being a free one I mean it works great for shay its supposed to do very nice 5 stars
A1052C30OWTBTK B009ZS2B28 5 1358035200 20 This is a very different type of BINGO! I absolutely love this game! The most fun I have PLAYING BINGO!
A1052C30OWTBTK B00BJA2VFW 5 1365552000 21 love playing in the tournament mode to see if i can beat my high score and how long it will take;-)
A1052C30OWTBTK B007Q3KX42 5 1345161600 23 My 9yr old loves it because she loves animals! She wants to be a vet when she grows up so she plays one!
A1052C30OWTBTK B00A4KVFLY 3 1354060800 38 I was very excited to see this in the library of the Kindle Fire. But it will not open...forces close before it even signs in to Facebook. had to uninstall. if glitches get fixed might try it again
A1052C30OWTBTK B00910Y1OQ 5 1350691200 30 I have played this on the PC and was so glad to see it for the Kindle. Fire!  I love Match 3 Quest games. Great pass the time away game.
A1052C30OWTBTK B008MEM24S 5 1346630400 23 I am a 40 year -old who originally downloaded this for my kids.  Well now I am addicted to it myself. Love Perry!
A1052C30OWTBTK B008JK6W5K 5 1355961600 30 some of the logos I get pretty quick, but others are rather challenging!  great way to pass the time and its a game the whole family can play for hours!
A1053REE2BCFXA B008J1ZVRY 5 1342569600 35 its awesome the only thing bad was on my kindel once I use my finger it doesn't work but when I use my nail it works but its still awesome and fun please  get it

A1053REE2BCFXA B005UOK2KY 3 1343088000 26 its really fun like office jerk a little anyone hate it is practically a nerd so remember that all the heaters this is a wlawesome game
A1053REE2BCFXA B0089DZSNE 3 1342915200 25 a boyfriend?what the heck I dare anyone make this game!!!!u can grow up and go in the real world but its fun for some ppl
A1053REE2BCFXA B0097M6WDG 3 1350172800 24 its ok.but its kinda gross so dont let younger kids play or they can get them selves in trouble if they tell in school
A1053REE2BCFXA B0086700CM 5 1342569600 25 I cant believe how fun it is someone I know got like 10000. all the haters must have problems maybe that's y they hate it

A1053REE2BCFXA B007OX6DIY 5 1342483200 24 its awesome the horse is cool but the jaguars or cheetahs can kill ur horse I cant believe it but it is so awesome
A1053REE2BCFXA B009HKL4B8 5 1355184000 35 This game is awesome.It runs smoothly and is fun.You can have  baby on it but not the way from th  sim like you buy the crib with your sim money and then add the baby
A1053REE2BCFXA B0066HA1A0 3 1342396800 33 I don't really like it I think its boring because u are not a person in it if u were I would love this game I mean really love this game no joke.
A1053REE2BCFXA B0064DBE9I 5 1342569600 25 I love it so much I can cry Bahama all the heaters could. be a blabbermouth. and talk bad about it but I love it!!
A1054NUI3ZZOY4 B00A3NQNUU 5 1366329600 29 this app is awesome! my friend showed it to me and I said I had it but he made me get it again and it was so much fun!
A1054NUI3ZZOY4 B009UX2YAC 5 1357171200 20 this game is the best I downloaded it on alllllll of the devices in my house there are no problems
A1054NUI3ZZOY4 B00992CF6W 5 1361491200 36 I really really really want this game but my dad said it is to much money so could you please please please lower the prices to about $2.00 or $1.29 or something around those 2 numbers?PLEASE!?PLEASE!?PLEASE!?
A1054NUI3ZZOY4 B00B2V66VS 4 1359417600 34 so I just got it and it didn't work right and then I deleted it so that I could re download it but when I triied to re download it it wouldn't let me!
A1055GRX9ZR4QI B006AZZPCM 4 1367971200 43 great full functioning easy to use. but I think it could use some improvements. But I can hardly complain for it's price. it deserves a 5 star because it was free. but I gave it 4 star because it could use some improvement.
A1057CAH0SHJ74 B00CEBKMN8 5 1392163200 27 It's a really good game. Just wish it didn't take so long to get more coins & I can't figure out where to purchase the magic key.
A1057CAH0SHJ74 B00E5GJ7QS 4 1401408000 24 I really like this game. It is very addictive though, haven't been able to put it down since I started playing 2 hrs ago!:-)
A1057CAH0SHJ74 B00AMEFZ72 5 1401408000 41 I really like this game a lot, now that I've figured it out. It's a little confusing at first &amp; took me a while to get the hang of but hang in there &amp; I'm sure you'll really like it too!
A1057CAH0SHJ74 B00B2TET3C 5 1401926400 25 I really really love this game but it is VERY addictive. I've been on it over 2 hours now and can't put it down!! :)
A1057CAH0SHJ74 B007TBAQCK 4 1402185600 30 This is a very fun and addictive game. I've been on it for 2 hours now but it doesn't give you enough coins. Gotta wait too long or buy more.
A1057TBXI4PPP7 B00DRHY8EW 5 1383091200 32 This game is a lot of fun and has a good story line. It is just challenging enough without being too easy or too frustrating. I am looking forward to the sequel.
A1057TBXI4PPP7 B0091REZMW 5 1364342400 40 Yes, you can play this game without buying diamonds as I have for quite some time now. You just have to be patient. The recent update added more challenges and greatly improved the game. I truly enjoy playing &quot;Mystery Manor&quot;.
A1058DVLLZIYVN B0085P2Z6E 4 1356652800 48 I love this type of game, but it is small on my phone.  Most of the time you can enlarge the screens, but then get penalized for random clicks as you move the screen.  It is a fun story though.  I like this well enough to keep playing.
A1058DVLLZIYVN B008NCUFYS 4 1350604800 33 this app is great fun, but it crashes my phone frequently.  The app is fun and addictive.  easy game play.  lots of missions and prizes.  would be 5 star if it didn't crash.
A1058F6E2VAC0K B008XG1X18 5 1347062400 33 Love this app. There are some issues with crashing but hey any dedicated pinterest User such as myself would be overlooking of this minor problem. All in all I would recommend this app.
A1058F6E2VAC0K B008KMAJQU 4 1346371200 21 Good game. A little glitchy but it's worth giving it a try. If you like killing zombies then you'll enjoy this.
A1058F6E2VAC0K B00CFNDUIY 5 1370649600 29 Really fun and addicting, I only wish for faster energy recovery because I want to play all the time. Very good job on this game. I'll be playing forever.
A1058F6E2VAC0K B00599ZRSC 5 1347062400 38 Violent yet satisfying game. Very addicting once you've figured out how to earn enough money to buy better guns. Although the glu coin guns are outrageously priced. Still gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend this game.
A10591SDGN869O B00GDADUPS 4 1387756800 21 Good game, very difficult to do sometimes but I enjoy it.  Gets a little repetitive at times and needs some color.
A10591SDGN869O B00DJFIMW6 4 1376179200 40 This is a cute game, little difficult for my 6 year old grandson to get the hang of at first but now seems ok with it.  It did take forever to download and get ready to play.  Seems ok now.
A10591SDGN869O B009HQ9UHC 5 1356652800 21 This will be a great game for my grandsons to enjoy.  I have played it myself and it can be addicting.
A10591SDGN869O B00CJ77HU8 5 1387756800 29 Play this game almost daily.  Great game, works great and always a challenge.  Graphics are good and my 6 year grandson even gives it a try and does well.
A1059SXDMUSBID B008469DGY 5 1386201600 21 Flick golf is a fun little game that requires delicate flicking of the index finger.  Even my grandson like to play.
A1059SXDMUSBID B007VUA7VO 5 1368057600 23 This is a great little app to keep you informed on your battery status.  It is simple to use.  Glad I found it.
A1059SXDMUSBID B00B4LFMGG 5 1363651200 41 This app is a great way to stay abreast of the day's headlines, most of which aren't in local newspapers.  I can read these in a matter of minutes and am caught up with what's happening around the country and world.
A1059SXDMUSBID B006OOHYIC 5 1364601600 41 This game reminds me of chess in that you have to think ahead of your moves in order to decide how to move the raindrop in catching all the pearls in the fewest moves possible.  It is a great brain exercise.
A1059SXDMUSBID B00B2V66VS 5 1360108800 24 Love this game.  Can't get very far yet but it's fun trying.  Grandkids love it also.  Fun to play awhile then come back later.
A1059SXDMUSBID B00B116U0G 5 1377734400 36 Downloaded this app several weeks ago.  It is fun to play.  Never thought blowing cup sheep could be so much fun.  I haven't gone very far into the game yet as my spare time is limited.
A1059SXDMUSBID B004JZBGWI 5 1363651200 22 Great little reminder. Simple to use and update.  Can also alphabetize and prioritize lists and errands.  Easy to add and delete things
A1059SXDMUSBID B00B99KJR0 5 1364601600 52 This game is similar to the &#34;Call of Atlantis&#34; game.  So far I've only played for several days and haven't gotten very far, not knowing how involved the game goes in depth.  It is fun to play and see if you can secure the object of the day before time runs out,
A1059SXDMUSBID B00910Y1OQ 5 1364601600 96 I installed the free version of this game and went through the 7 sections really enjoying it, until you find out to go any further you have to buy the full version.  Well, that ticked me off, especially at $4.99 for the full version.  That is way too much for an app game.  So I waited until it went half price, then I thought that's still too much, so when it went on sale for .99 cents I bought it.  I love playing this game with all the different levels of history from the ancient world.
A105DBTD21A6FZ B008Y7SMQU 5 1375747200 21 Nice app AND..I get 10 hints now!!! :D This is challenging and fun. I do recommend. Thank you.-review rebelSelf-declared review V.I.P

A105DBTD21A6FZ B00D1WA26Q 5 1370476800 23 This is without any doubt the best app ever! It's so adorable! I have a dentist appointment next week, and this really helps!&lt;3:)
A105EKMF2JN07Y B00CKW6FVE 4 1373414400 40 Fun variation of the original Tetris game, the changes make it easier to play on a touch device. I prefer the original Tetris style to &#34;Blitz,&#34; but this is a good time killer. The game requires a lot of memory.
A105EKMF2JN07Y B008IU2GVA 5 1373414400 24 I was addicted to the game until I beat it. Good number of levels with a good amount of challenge as the levels progressed.
A105EKMF2JN07Y B00CHSPB8Y 4 1373414400 21 Entertaining, good game, but runs slow on occasion on my 1st gen Kindle Fire. Would still recommend as it is free.
A105FOEZAHKUTH B00529IOXO 5 1349481600 39 i lov this app i use it all he time...its great for texting and calling but u cant call on the kindle fire...its great for texting your friends if u dont have a phone...download this app!!!! it works great!!!!
A105FOEZAHKUTH B007BPFIE0 1 1351382400 29 this game was ridiculously stupid there is no point in it...the only time i had fun involving this game is when i uninstalled it do not get this app
A105FOEZAHKUTH B009KEN87O 5 1363824000 24 this was an amazing game...no glitches and i thought it was really fun. i would suggest this game to anyone it is so fun
A105GM37MWPTQW B008Y2FRFO 5 1368748800 24 this game is so simple it's addicting! it may glitches sometimes but most games do. plus its free so go ahead and get it.
A105GM37MWPTQW B007TXUZ1U 5 1338768000 33 &Agrave;ll I can say is I love this and if you want to take care of a baby and not reallyhave a baby or a lifelike doll this is the app for you.
A105PL1EQUM7ZA B0091REZMW 4 1364428800 39 If yo jade into solving mysterys and like a detective game, then this is a game for you. I am only 13 years old and I love this game!! it is a 4 star rate for me. MUST TRY!
A105PL1EQUM7ZA B00DJFIMW6 5 1373760000 40 this app is great fun for everyone! it is almost the same as temple run but you have cool achievements to accomplish as well as ur playing a cute minion! you can buy costoms for you minion and race them!
A105PL1EQUM7ZA B009HKL4B8 5 1362614400 28 this app is a real life experance. meet new freinds shop garden and start a business. I would recommend this app for anyone with a love for life.
A105PL1EQUM7ZA B0091SUMB4 5 1387584000 31 I thought this app wasn't going to work. I went on the enternet but got logged off my Internet and using this app fixed it!  I love this app definately recomended
A105PL1EQUM7ZA B00CB2837W 4 1374969600 101 DOINT LISTEN!!! I have read the reviews for this app and most of them where bad. so I got it for myself. truth to tell it does glitch a bit and all you have to do is deleat then reinstall it. its not all the time. I made it to level six before it happened. and it is true that you need to buy gold. but a lot of things doint take gold. and if they do, they take a lot of gold. but all I ask of you is to try it out for yourself.  just give it a chance.:)
A105PL1EQUM7ZA B009HHX414 4 1369612800 23 This app is a great way to message your freinds with no cost at all. This app is fast and easy to use!
A105PX2MX3UAR B005ZTFPFQ 2 1391040000 54 You have to pay for all the other games.  I guess it would be worth it if you liked all those other games but there aren't many really good ones.  I remember there were so many other games that were actually fun on the Atari and they don't seem to be on the list!Michele
A105PX2MX3UAR B00CH26TL8 1 1391040000 62 The app doesn't work on my Kindle.  I've downloaded it twice.  Every time I try to open the app it hesitates and then shuts down.  I'm not too bothered though bc I'm on a level that I can't pass and it hasn't been fun to play for awhile.  So no big loss.  I can direct my anger and frustration at candy crush.Michele
A105PX2MX3UAR B00D948SS0 4 1391040000 84 I really like the word search a lot BUT you have to wait to get tokens, it only gives you one a day, and the longer you play the less tokens you earn.  When I started playing it would give me tokens for solving the search at a certain speed but now it never gives me tokens no matter how fast I solve it.  It still has the best searches of any of the word searches I've downloaded otherwise it would get 3 stars.Michele
A105UL54HEL0CI B00G5LQ5MU 4 1399161600 35 This app is very puzzling. The first few are not but it just gets harder . I spend a lot of time on this. I like this app .and I hope you all get it.
A105YUKPXLYFN1 B00683JK9K 3 1360108800 40 Puzzles are ok, but the delay in pieces moving/rotating and getting placed is very annoying. After only a few tries I gave up and uninstalled. I'd rather spend time counting sheep than be aggravated by a game that won't respond....
A105YUKPXLYFN1 B006VW94HQ 4 1342915200 23 addictive! it took me a minute to catch on, but now I can't put it down!!! it's a must have! definitely worth buying!
A105YUKPXLYFN1 B004S33RRI 5 1370217600 98 I've had this app for over a year now and must say it's aamazing! I use it every week for our groceries. I love the fact that it adds the tax and has multiple lists for me to add to (like wal mart, winn Dixie, target, etc). And it remembers my stuff and prices from week to week! They are always updating it to make it better and I just keep getting happier with the app! Well worth the money!Oh, and I can text the list to my husband if he's going to the store instead of me....
A1060ANAWXX1DA B009HKL4B8 5 1400976000 28 This game is awesome. I love it because of all of the cool activities that can be accomplished through each sim and how they react to certain activities.
A1060ANAWXX1DA B00821NZ74 5 1353628800 27 I love this game because you get to feed and change your child's clothes and their name. also you get to make them do many different things.
A1060ANAWXX1DA B00529IOXO 3 1346457600 46 texting works great. but cant get a name to be added to a phone #. too bad there isn't an alert chime or something like that ~to know that u have a new text. got it mainly for the kids and for that ...it works fine.
A1060ANAWXX1DA B007TXUZ1U 5 1353628800 24 I love this game beacause you get to feed your baby and give it clothes. also you get to make your baby do things.
A1060ANAWXX1DA B00EBE8MUG 5 1388016000 21 current and old Tv shows.  I could get some answers &amp; have to ask my kids for help. everyone has fun!
A1060CZKXKDLOL B004SRPXWQ 5 1368403200 40 I just got the Talking Tom Cat app.  This is the cutest little cat and when he repeats what I said to him, my real life cats come running over if I say their name and then he repeats it!
A1060CZKXKDLOL B007DLSWJ0 3 1370131200 22 It would be nice if it changed to a bunch of different dogs...not just one!!  Just this one dog cleaning the screen!
A1060CZKXKDLOL B008AIGWVA 5 1370131200 21 I like Ben the dog, especially when he interacts with Tom the cat!  He makes Tom jump up on the ceiling!
A1060CZKXKDLOL B0064DBE9I 5 1370131200 28 I am trying to teach myself the piano while exercising my hand after a severe fall down the back steps and my left hand no longer works well.
A1063WOOWYE9TB B00AIUUXHC 5 1367107200 23 It's the best game ever it halarious...and awesome and cool...sorta violent but amazing ...I would recommend this to everyone I know like forealz
A1063WOOWYE9TB B008V06NRU 5 1367107200 27 I like it a lot...its cute and a great virtual pet thing...I think Pou is a great game and I think is the best virtual pet ...
A1063WOOWYE9TB B00B2V66VS 4 1367107200 21 I think this is a pretty good game ...but does it have an end ...if it does how is it like....
A1063WOOWYE9TB B00918L02E 5 1367107200 32 its sooo cute and fun...I'm woo glad I got it ....if it weren't for my friend I would be so bored right now but I'm not cuz I'm playing it right now...:)
A1067SP8MSJRMX B00AIUUXHC 5 1364342400 47 I love it a lot graphics are amazing the only thing I have an issue with is that is crashed once and reset but overall great. Level up to a great white and rule the sea right now I'm at the tiger shark love it to bits.
A1067SP8MSJRMX B007SYWFRM 5 1334534400 22 people said is freezes up but not on mine great and loads of fun I got it and have not stoped playing
A1067SP8MSJRMX B0066HA1A0 5 1331251200 20 this app is really great it's really fun to bild a company and diliver the goods and upgrade the buildings
A1068NI26ZRTU4 B007PT3QOQ 4 1334188800 29 this game is really fun but the energy runs out dealt fast. there is also no way to get out of the game unless you hit the power button.
A1068NI26ZRTU4 B0064X7FVE 3 1336003200 24 This is a good app, unless you want weather 5-20 minutes ago. Its not good at exact weather for your house or area either.
A10697DCVM0J5H B008V06NRU 5 1370649600 45 I love my new pet Lou I love playing with him he is so cute!!! I love him and I treat him like my real pet who am kidding he I is my pet i pet he is amazing and u should totally get one!!!!
A10697DCVM0J5H B008MEM24S 5 1358035200 20 This is a wonderful app to use it is easy and fun :-) I totally recommend it for all ages!!!
A10697DCVM0J5H B00BS3UFCQ 5 1365984000 29 Nice cool app fun to play so easy lots of fun amazing levels I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so much!!!!!!!!
A106AJUW0NO0IK B00CWY76CC 5 1371513600 21 I love this gamenot too hard but still makes you think.  I would like more games like thiscute rooms and challenging
A106AJUW0NO0IK B0091REZMW 4 1386115200 38 I really like this game. Only gave four stars because while you can play forever without purchasing anything the price of the gems is way over priced. It would be nicer if they did not cost so much.
A106E9UY563COL B0094BB4TW 1 1367798400 55 This app doesn't load correctly. It says it is loading , but it takes forever and it doesn't load.. It freezes up. If by an act of god you do get it load something. Then the next time you use it only pulls up what it managed to load the previous time..... It really sucks
A106E9UY563COL B00BW08XRO 5 1373414400 34 Cute game , wish it was free, instead of playing and getting hooked on it and then being told you have to pay to keep playing.. but i guess everyone needs to make money
A106E9UY563COL B00ATDOVNK 5 1359072000 28 Pretty cool game. Wish i could find more games like it. A little freaking when things pop out at you, but other than that , still great game
A106FZZGRP6LXR B004SYIA1U 5 1312934400 65 I&apos;m only 34 but growing up in my house we weren&apos;t allowed to have t.v.s in or rooms. my dad had a bunch of cassettes of old radio shows. so that was my entertainment in my room before I fell asleep. this app brings it all back. I just hope they add a few more shows like the bickersons. can&apos;t get enough of that comedy.
A106FZZGRP6LXR B007NACZPI 5 1332460800 41 in order to get 30 crystals for free they make you give it a 5 star rating. don't get me wrong. this is a good fun game. but I wouldn't rate it a 5. realistically looking at a 3 or 4.
A106FZZGRP6LXR B0052UZIFA 5 1330041600 23 Works great on my DROID X. Won the game multiple times and still play it for hours. The bonus games are awesome too.
A106HPMZLKDDOT B00G5LQ5MU 4 1398729600 31 Fantastic game! I just found that it was way too short! Some difficult parts, which made it challenging, in a good way. Hopefully there will be more similar games to come!
A106JMRSLCPDSV B004Q3CJQ0 5 1305676800 71 This is really a great app that gives you a bright, targeted beam of light as it uses your camera's LED. This is why it needs access to your Droid's camera; not to take pictures. Would highly recommend this app to all Droid owners. Sometime you might be in a situation where you need a flashlight and don't have one. Now, if you have your trusty Droid with you, you do!
A106JMRSLCPDSV B00BT1SL50 4 1378339200 129 This game really makes you plan your shots to get the best score. The &#34;Sticky Land&#34; course is especially frustrating when you hit a bad or poorly planned shot. If you like the strategy involved in playing &#34;Angry Birds&#34;, you will like this game. It is easy to play but challenging to master. You are faced with tough decisions on every hole. Do you try to shave some strokes off your game and take the risky shortcut, or do you play it safe and take a little longer way to the green? Should I use a lot of power to get over this water hazard, or use less power and lay up just in front of it? This is a very entertaining and addictive game!! I highly recommend it!!!!
A106JMRSLCPDSV B004O9G750 1 1397347200 37 It's OK until you get to the upper levels then it will not give the colors of the bubbles that you need at all. A more useful endeavor would be banging your head against a brick wall.
A106KNRQKRXH4G B00AVGGYNA 4 1404518400 39 This game may not be the best bingo game I've played, but ranks pretty darn high.It's a bit different in the fact that you don't play against players...just a certain amount of numbers are called,but you do have powerhouse.
A106KNRQKRXH4G B00E5GJ7QS 5 1399680000 27 One of the best Bingo games out there. Very fun to play. I recommend it! You won't be sorry and it's a free download. GO FOR IT!
A106TMRGSJ6JW5 B009ZZGX98 4 1398556800 49 I am like most people who play Mahjong games. I love them, spend hours playing them and am always looking for more versions. I was not real happy when I first realized the board moves but I have adjusted and now, I don't want to play any other way.
A106TMRGSJ6JW5 B008XME36E 5 1401926400 40 I get free books everyday. I used to scroll for hours through lists and lists and now I just tap it open and there they are. It really works and I have found with free apps, that is a rarity.
A106TMRGSJ6JW5 B005AJ6ISO 4 1405209600 33 It is exactly what it says it is. The words spoken by our King. I love it, the only downfall is that it doesn't share on Facebook for me on my Kindle fire.
A106UB2ZCYULZ3 B008XG1X18 5 1385596800 27 If you love Pinterest this App it is a necessity for Kindle Fire. It works great. The only down side is there Pinterest is very addicting :)
A106UB2ZCYULZ3 B007D2XSW0 5 1376352000 21 Fun. &amp; easy to use. Great product and easy way to share cute pics on Facebook. Worth giving it a try
A106UB2ZCYULZ3 B00B2V66VS 5 1377302400 29 This game is so addicting and fun! Even if you die your will not be able to put it down. You want to keep beating you last run :)
A106VUWWBWE0WW B009HKL4B8 5 1391212800 24 I am able to relax and leave all my responsibilities behind.  I just spend enjoyable time playing Sims Free play. I love this game.
A106VUWWBWE0WW B00E8KLWB4 5 1400716800 89 When my sister showed me this game,  I was very sceptical.  I have played many different games and either immediately lost interest or found that the aim of most of them was to get me to spend money.  This game is challenging.  Sometimes I do really well. The next time I am challenged to think faster and expand my abilities and mind.  I don't have to spend money to do well in the game.  I usually play the game several times a day.  I am really enjoying the game.
A106XHERWNXTVK B00KOEHQCW 4 1403308800 82 I haven't seen this movie or Frozen, but I enjoy both Free Fall games very much.  They are challenging in their own ways.  And if you'd played CC Saga, you already know the strategy. I like that this game gives you the power ups at the beginning, once you've earned them.  I cracked up when Malifacent gives you the wave off if you fail a level!  On Frozen, the characters look sad.  I am recommending this game to my fellow Fire Gamer.
A106XHERWNXTVK B00C7TAF3Y 5 1383955200 56 Wasn't quite sure what to expect, this was a free download.  As soon as I caught on, I was totally engrossed!  It was so exciting to find the clues and objects that helped you move along, turning keys, opening secret doors, waiting to see what's next.  Yes, agree that it was too short, I WANT MORE!
A106XHERWNXTVK B00BQPEIT2 3 1368921600 116 Only get free games for my KHD, was able to get this from free coins Amazon gave me (thank you!).  Since I'm a TR1 & TR2 addict, gave this one a shot.  Graphics are  beautiful.  Pretty much same concept as TR games. It's challenging at first because you're unaware of the upcoming obstacles.  I wish there was more to it, though, like more characters to run, and let you choose the power ups during your run.  Didn't meet my expectations, but I'll keep it.  UPDATE:  they added more characters, but, of course, you have to buy them.  No thanks.  I'm figuring out slowly but surely how the power ups and stuff work.  It's an okay game.
A106XHERWNXTVK B004HE5TAG 4 1372982400 40 Really enjoy this game, simple and basic.  Between this game and the slots, I come back every so often to collect my free coins. Don't know the reason for the recent update, just glad I didn't lose my accumulated coins.
A106XHERWNXTVK B00DZ22QNO 3 1385424000 42 Pretty challenging.  First 15 were easy for me.  Yeah, what to do when you get stumped and have less coins and not a FB user?  Not spending a penny just to find an answer.  IMDB is helpful.  This is a free download.
A106XHERWNXTVK B008Y2FRFO 5 1366329600 62 I used to see these at our county fair back in the day!  This game is so addictive it isn't even funny! Have completed all the puzzles and spent all the dozer dollars.  Thanks to hints from other reviewers, I have over 20,000 coins accumulated, there's no way I can lose now.  Still love the big coin drop after the red one!
A106XHERWNXTVK B006BDHAX0 4 1378252800 69 Okay, first the birds, then the temple, now this?  I love the free version, played til I got 3 stars on all the games in the 4 Dragon levels.  Paid a buck for this one because I wanted MORE and you get plenty more games with this one. I like the tiles from this game, for some odd reason. And I like the sounds when you make a match.
A106XHERWNXTVK B00FJYQUD8 3 1389657600 45 Free app of the day.....not so free after a few teaser levels.  Then either pay $4.99 (ain't gonna happen) or sign up for newsletters, no thank you.  I love regular Fishdom, no lock ups, no ads, no limit, just not enough tanks.  Deleting this one.
A106XHERWNXTVK B0064TVQ5E 4 1375142400 62 Really challenging game!  Took over 11 minutes on my very first game, trying to figure out how the tiles are stacked.  The characters start looking the same after awhile!  This game can also make you sleepy, not that it's boring, it just tires you out sometimes.  You can improve your time by using both thumbs when playing.Will be checking out similar games.
A106XHERWNXTVK B0097GVJWQ 4 1403913600 44 Sometimes confusing.  Like with the angel heads,  couldn't figure out how to switch them.  I'm just taking my time, not going to try and rush through.  Thanks for being free!  Otherwise I wouldn't ever try this type of game.  Bottom line, I like it.
A106XHERWNXTVK B00964BWFS 4 1382832000 72 Wasn't sure, looked like a kid's game, but found that it was a little challenging and was a free download.  Nice graphics, building an aquarium was an interesting twist, the fish and other items are expensive!  I agree with other reviews, the symbols are a bit small, but I got used to it.  What happens after my third tank is complete? You create another user and start over again, if you like!
A106XHERWNXTVK B00FAPF5U0 5 1382313600 71 THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW:  Okay, got the Candy Crush bug!!  At Level 178; I think sometimes it predicts your moves and let's you win if you've been stuck for a couple of weeks or more.  Just when you think it can't get more difficult, it does!!!  Then there are levels where you win on the first try.  Oh well.  At least I haven't paid a single cent on this game.
A106XHERWNXTVK B00B2V66VS 5 1366675200 83 This game just pulls you in because you want to beat all the new daily and weekly challenges!  What do you do with all the points and gems you've accumulated after you've gained all the characters and power ups?  Yet you just can't stop....I don't care if you run 2k meters or 10k, I just replay over and over and over again, especially after finally mastering the tunnel ride.  One good thing, I'll never use real money.  Please don't develop a TR3!!!!!!  Aargh!!!
A106XHERWNXTVK B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366588800 28 Pretty good game,  challenging, makes you think, thought I watched a lot of TV/movies,  but there are so many!  Have to be more careful in using my hints.
A106XHERWNXTVK B0088Y7YHW 4 1365206400 32 Fun game for free download.  Lots of things going on.  Don't know why anyone would buy coins with real money since you're not winning real cash.  Oh well, game is fun, nonetheless.
A106XHERWNXTVK B008Y7SMQU 4 1361577600 21 I like this logo game.  You can move onto the next levels faster than some of the other ones I've played.
A106XHERWNXTVK B008JK6W5K 5 1398384000 61 Had installed this game awhile ago, with most levels completed.  Then moved on to other games.  Came back to see how my memory is, not too bad! These logos are everywhere!  That seems to be my focus while shopping, watching commercials, reading mags, billboards, the news....Aargh!!  But I love that it keeps your brain going, something necessary as you get older!
A106XHERWNXTVK B0073LHCCS 4 1373673600 36 I like this game.  I like how you can scramble the solved words to figure out the next one.  Word games have always been my favorites!  Have only played a short while so no complaints yet.
A106ZHVFB1JRJP B0058UO9AE 5 1364860800 30 very easy to using lots of fun all my friends want to play against me and we even do little tournaments to see who the expert is. love this app
A106ZHVFB1JRJP B004R7L4JS 5 1364860800 36 I feel smarter using this. Challenging tests to expand your mind, but a great trainer. After a while the tests become easier, not sure if it's my brain or repeats on the part of the game
A106ZHVFB1JRJP B004GVV4T0 5 1364860800 21 this app provides of fun with increasingly difficult puzzles. very easy to control and lots of fun to play highly recommended
A106ZHVFB1JRJP B007C8DXQQ 5 1364860800 24 it's not wheel of fortune, but very similar. great graphics easy controls hours and hours of family fun highly recommended. great for all ages
A106ZHVFB1JRJP B004O9G750 5 1364860800 21 provides hours of casual fun and very easy to control. highly recommended and very glad I chose this for my tablet
A106ZHVFB1JRJP B006RXD2I6 5 1364860800 24 fun time passing game. lots of game choices easy to control a great game for all ages and skill levels get your copy today!
A1070HUC8EC5IS B00G5LQ5MU 5 1389225600 26 Great game so far you have to solve a lot of puzzles to get out of the titanic to get hints you just have to review
A1070HUC8EC5IS B00992CF6W 4 1378080000 21 I think that you should add weather changes and more mobs have animals follow wheat and breeding and add jungle biome
A1070HUC8EC5IS B00HY5QKHQ 5 1396310400 20 Its really good but when they're battling it should have better graphics so it looks like the same for everything
A1076XRX563PLK B0062P7SSY 5 1329091200 20 Cute and fun game. It is challenging enough without driving you crazy. I'm hoping for more lvls to download soon!
A1076XRX563PLK B00846GKTW 5 1337644800 25 they ask you to rate the game for coins in the first 5 minutes so hopefully it is worth my rating... will update if needed.
A1076XRX563PLK B007V2UGPE 5 1335312000 24 I have already played for awhile and I am still having fun. cool concept. cool game with lots of ways to play each level.
A1079CQTAUIX6J B00881VLCE 4 1402012800 45 A very scenic and bright screen and soft melodies playing is the perfect way to unwind.  Minus one star as they only give 3 puzzles per category. With your choice of the number of pieces the difficulty ranges from child to advanced puzzler.Worth the download.
A1079CQTAUIX6J B0079Q963K 5 1401753600 34 This app works exactly as it was advertised to do. Watch TV, check the program guide and even use it as second remote. Great app to have if you have Optimum Cable Service.Highly recommended.
A1079CQTAUIX6J B006PJ3UKC 5 1403395200 46 Notifications of breaking news and the days high lights with full coverage reading if wanted.  This app was an unexpected pleasure that turned out to be one of my most frequently used.  News, sports, weather and more in a very sleek package with great graphics.Highly recommended.
A1079CQTAUIX6J B00AQ398AY 5 1401753600 118 I have LOOKOUT for my Android smartphone and it is absolutely incredible as it checks browsing safety and app security.  It even automatically scanned my device for the new &#34;Heartbleed&#34; virus.This app works identically well in my Kindle.  Runs in the background and notifies you if things are safe as it scans for malware and other malicious bugs that crawl around cyber space.I would not download any app or browse any web site without LOOKOUT protecting my device.  Now with &#34;FIND MY DEVICE&#34; that takes a photo of unauthorized persons attempting to enter an incorrect password and sends it to your email account.  Then it shows you the location of the device by use of the GPS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
A107D7VEC8IV7 B00850NK6I 5 1399852800 86 I read 4 books a week - mysteries - so I go to my local library and check out books every week. I bought a Kindle because I am going on a cruise and do not want to carry 4 library books with me.  Overdrive is the website my library told me to go to to borrow E-books that I can read on my Kindle.  I have done that and have been pleased with the results. I am also very happy reading books from the Kindle.
A107D7VEC8IV7 B0094BB4TW 5 1399852800 39 I got used to having FB on my I-phone and was very happy to find I could also get it on my new Kindle Fire.  The larger format is very nice especially when looking at pictures that are posted.

A107O88X9VTJXJ B00ELMHHAE 3 1396742400 20 I have played this for a few hours altogether now.  It is okay and I am  not that enamored. Thanks.
A107O88X9VTJXJ B005ZXWMUS 5 1396742400 38 A full-time caregiver for a disabled parent generally doesn't get out as much for movies.  I appreciate the ease of being able to catch up with films I wasn't sure I'd care to see from the trailers alone.

A107P458W5J80U B0087TQYUG 5 1396051200 54 I give this a 5 star rating. I like it better on the kindle than I do on the computer. You don't have to sit and watch 15-30 second advertisements while using the kindle. On the computer you do. Therefore I will not even play unless on the kindle. Keep up the good work.
A107P458W5J80U B00GNIJAEA 5 1396051200 24 The kindle fire hdx is the only place I have used bitstrips. I have only used it a few times but thoroughly enjoy it.
A107P458W5J80U B00CF354UG 1 1396051200 60 We purchased Grand Theft Auto: Vice City just the other day and it did not download. However it says we have it installed. I have yet to contact you concerning our purchase. I also wish you would give deals every now and then where something like, buy one get one half price or free or something to that extent.Thank you.
A107PT5KETBET7 B007QTSROE 3 1391990400 29 This game is OK for a little while but not for long.  Even my son, who loves to play games on my phone, did not play this for long.
A107PT5KETBET7 B00CXVX1OQ 4 1389830400 37 My son (12) played with this for a short time (5-6 times) and then was bored with it. I am keeping it on my phone because he will come back to one day when he is bored.
A107PT5KETBET7 B004J1AYW0 5 1389830400 21 This is a good app for the classic game of Reversi.  I great way to kill a little bit of time.
A107PT5KETBET7 B00846WWVM 4 1389830400 38 This is the type of game to have on your phone when you are bored and need a short diversion.  I am not one to play games for long but this one is probably my favorite right now.
A107PT5KETBET7 B004XNPQUO 5 1389830400 22 This game was fun for a little while.  Good way to kill some time while waiting for someone but that is it.
A107PT5KETBET7 B005D9MUWY 5 1389830400 86 This is the first thing I put on my phone.  I have noticed though, if you are a &#34;hunt and peck&#34; typist you might not like this app.  Those that I know that don't like this app do not know how to type.  I think this is because it messes up the predictive feature if you hesitate to find the next key.  You do not have to be a great typist but you need to know the keyboard well enough to be fluid with your swiping.
A107PT5KETBET7 B0063IH60K 5 1391990400 22 This is a good version of the standard game of solitaire.  Nothing special but a good way to waste a little time.
A107R7JO2SDFL B00529IOXO 4 1328832000 71 PLEASE CLICK TO SEE ALL!!  I was one of the only one of my friends who don't have a phone, and was getting left in the dust.  So I got this app on my kindle fire, and can text all my friends!  I love it so much!!  The only problem is it doesn't notify when u get a txt.  if they could fix that, and the speed it would be PERFECT!
A107R7JO2SDFL B00COVCV50 5 1372550400 23 This app is really addictive, and challenging.  It's very hard to stop playing.  I really love this game!  It will make you think.
A107R7JO2SDFL B0067Q4PQQ 3 1326499200 32 its a fun game, get the free version.  but I wouldn't spend my money on it.  Fun and addicting, but not extraordinary.  its really busy and annoying, but still fun.  partal credit.
A107R7JO2SDFL B007TXUZ1U 5 1338854400 32 I check it all the time.  Incredibly simple, but it simply fills me with joy to check my baby each hour, and see how she's growing up.  My big, and little one.
A107R7JO2SDFL B009HKL4B8 5 1348963200 25 the dumb thing totally crashed and my kindle keeps shtting off but the reason im mad is because I love the game so dang much!
A107R7JO2SDFL B004UID2LC 5 1333843200 101 I had wanted to download some Hunger Games parodies by alicecullengirl (Alice Christine)  I love them, and she made album only available on itunes.  (I have a Kindle Fire) I wanted them on my music library, instead of having to surf the 'tube.  I had thought this app just accessed YouTube.  But I finally checked it out.  And now I have all 16 for when ever.  Plus others like If I Die Young, Glad You Came, and Set Fire to the Rain.  And its all FREE!!!! :)  GET IT!!! :)) And if you like Hunger Games, check out alicecullengirl's channel! ;)
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00AMEFZ72 4 1400803200 26 Me and my kids enjoyed playing bingo and the slot machines, easy to play. My daughter loves that the cards flash if the number is there.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00E5GJ7QS 4 1391817600 23 Fun and very entertaining, had a great time getting all my collection's complete. My kids even enjoy playing and collecting all the extras.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00AA87JGU 5 1376092800 32 This a game is enjoyable by all ages my six year old daughter loves playing doors and escape. She is always wanting to beat each level. Great game we love playing it.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00A9VD67E 4 1372896000 25 This games is very enjoyable,my daughter's have had a blast opening all the news levels. The best part you don't have to spend any money.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00E8KLWB4 4 1390608000 27 Loved playing this game, very entertaining and enjoyed all the little extra quest and games to play. I wish that experience points regenerated faster but that's ok.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B0091REZMW 4 1401753600 21 I love playing this Mystery Manner! It has fun and exciting levels and more rooms to explore whenever you level up.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00CXBSYVG 5 1372809600 21 Great game you will enjoy yourself playing. I had the best time playing this game with my friends.  Greatest game ever.
A107RYA0OHTRKS B00E1GFH2U 4 1381363200 40 This game is a very fun and addictive, you can play for hours and be entertained. Even the kids enjoy playing the word games and they learn while having fun. Love this game, but the time waits could be shorter.
A107SP1US7XQRR B00FB13Y74 5 1395532800 24 This game is epic you can drift and you are a bird in a kart racing. I playThis game as much as you do
A107SP1US7XQRR B00FATEJYE 5 1385769600 20 So awesome I love this game so awesome you should get this game totally worth the space plus it's free
A107SP1US7XQRR B00IH5UZ1E 5 1393977600 22 This game is so fun and addictive I just couldn't put down my kindle. Overall I would rate this game five stars
A107SP1US7XQRR B00A3NQNUU 5 1389657600 31 this is a game that is family friendly and very fun to play .although collecting gems can be a very frustrating challenge .so overall I would rate this game five stars.
A107SP1US7XQRR B00AO2P3GA 5 1389484800 63 awesome game I like that you can play at different map as Blake  campaign is great ps if you do all the missions as extremely hard you get a bounds gun that one shots anyone  my carbide map is alert the ice map pro tip crunch in the red car and stay there then when somebody comes by kill the they won't know
A107SP1US7XQRR B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392163200 23 I only have one word for this I love the game it's fun and addictive . I would give this game five stars
A107TLTID8H5NB B007S16X4Q 5 1355011200 25 I like word games and this is one that I really enjoy.  I can spend way more time playing this game than I really should.
A107TLTID8H5NB B0058UZSGS 5 1331510400 43 This does just what it promises.  The only thing that could improve it would be if a checked item would fall to the bottom and rise to the top when unchecked.  It would help with long reacurring lists.  I really like this app.
A107UZ5F4YR0XO B00A3NQNUU 4 1356566400 60 This is a good game with a good subject. Dragons are great. I like how you can breed different dragons and show them, but the game has little excitement. There should be some kind of battle feature. Maybe dragons could battle each other, or other players could attack your islands and your dragons would have to battle to protect it.
A107UZ5F4YR0XO B00850NK6I 4 1356566400 34 I like how you can get books from a library right to your tablet. When I want to read something, but don't want to buy a book, I can just get it off here.
A107WMIXVFLZLZ B004SOR4H6 4 1367280000 37 Some apps are great because they do great things, and others are great because they do exactly what you want them to do.  Twitter falls in the latter category.  It works very will with my Kindle Fire.
A10812207SWV40 B005D9MUWY 5 1311206400 64 I haven't tried all the many keyboards for Android, but once I started using this one,  no reason to try any others. It has  I  in a keyboard and great looking themes to boot! The best part  that I got it as the free app of the  a year or so ago as well! I'd still definitely pay for it though if  had to.
A10812207SWV40 B005FYBN1G 2 1368748800 56 Very little movement control, poor AI design as they just automatically move toward you and fire intermittently, and lack of interesting gameplay. You're just a tank in a small environment and you hope you can shoot your opponents 2-3 times before they shoot you more than the guaranteed one time . Fair graphics, but terrible gameplay.
A10812207SWV40 B004VMVTNU 5 1368316800 26 It allows you to make yourself do fairly challenging math problems before you can silence it, which makes quickly hitting the snooze button pretty much impossible.
A10869GOB1JQUF B00FEMJF6O 5 1384905600 21 Awesome game,love the story and imagination brought to your fingertips,makes u miss being a kid ..5 stars and 2 thumbs up.
A10869GOB1JQUF B00FATEJYE 3 1395187200 94 Other than the fact that the computer is capable of doing countless more than the actual &quot;human&quot; player..such as being able to break through what's supposed to be an unlockable combo something that absolutely impossible for the &quot;human&quot; player to do because I've mastered this game over and over spent countless dollars and many hours and yet I'm still nowhere close to having the reaction or impossibility skills that your created computer enemies have..how bout actually making the enemies not seem like your playing an infoulable &quot;computer&quot; but actually make the game enjoyable again.
A10869GOB1JQUF B00GRVV29E 5 1394236800 28 I've never had an app that could bring me so much peace and tranquility with the touch of a fingertip..this is by far the greatest Zen creation ever!bravo
A1086RU0HZGVYN B006WQ9NJU 2 1366329600 25 Have tried several times without success to put recipies on it.  Wish it had better instructions, or if they are there where to find them.
A1086RU0HZGVYN B009KS4XRO 1 1390867200 30 Thought I was getting something else.  I already have played this before and can not play any more without in app purchasing.  That is something I simply will NOT do.
A1086RU0HZGVYN B008UXIDYE 5 1395273600 23 It is great to have the Bible with me wherever I go.  The way it synchronizes on all of my units is awesome.
A1086RU0HZGVYN B00CJ77HU8 5 1373500800 24 Easy and relaxing.  Just what I need when I'm tired and want a no stress something to do.  Recommend it to others over 70.
A1086RU0HZGVYN B00CF6I3X8 2 1396396800 33 I think it's boring.  The colours and graphics are wonderful,but I haven't seen the challenge in it so far. So  it's not the one I go back to play over and over again.
A1086RU0HZGVYN B00DHKKN6Q 1 1390867200 24 I can not get this game to load at all.  Somehow I will uninstall it and perhaps try again. It did look like fun.
A1088ON515X4LV B006D1ONE4 5 1331337600 39 it's. a good app but when you get to the harder levels it's. hard to pass.it's. a good game for kids and grown ups you'll love this game very much if you get harder levels I wish you goodluck
A1088ON515X4LV B005KCQZ2K 4 1326585600 63 The first time I played this game I was addicted!!!  I spent the whole day playing, when I should have been doing other stuff!  Once I bought everything with my game money it wasn't so fun anymore because you have to buy things with real money to do anything else.  overall good game, I just refuse to pay real money to move on.
A1088ON515X4LV B004O9G750 1 1336867200 40 horable because when I try to aim to a place it wont aim not for kindle fire. take my word it is a dumb game after I am done writting this review I am going to remove from my kindle
A1088ON515X4LV B007SYDYLS 5 1351987200 43 you should buy word stack because you could mix and match words like synonyms and antanyms and more this game never gave me a problem downloading and stuff and this game is a brain teaser so watch out which word you put where

A1089MH1ID28GJ B00FRQ32N4 5 1393286400 27 This game is fun and addicting. It allows you to battle through multiple tiers of opponents, purchase different grades of robots, and upgrade them as you go.

A108AJYCVR5XNA B00CWY76CC 3 1387584000 30 This is a fun game. Really makes you think to figure out the clues to escape, but I wish you didn't have to rate it to get the next level.
A108B7QO1C39JE B0066T8SDU 5 1349481600 57 Scrabble is my all time Favorite games to play at home with Friends. And Now that I have it on my Kindle Fire, It's not just a home game I can play it anywhere there is a WiFi connection. This is Truly awesome for me and my Friends who Play online. Love this App. Thank you Amazon.
A108GP8QPDDR15 B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384214400 39 This game is soooooooooo fun it was just like some games that were just like that.I think it was called can you escape it was just as fun as this but this one is more fuuner than that one.
A108GP8QPDDR15 B00CQ9U1PW 4 1373241600 20 I like it because I get to beat someone up finally and sometimes it get's boring but it's still ok.
A108HP2JNI12PP B00CH26TL8 3 1373414400 31 this is a nice game, but not very original in concept.  It is designed to force you to either buy more bubbles, or delete the app.  I deleted.  Bejeweled is better.
A108HSKN4NVC6C B00AMR1HZ8 5 1362960000 28 Love this game.  Not very good at it but love playing it.  I downloaded for my daughter to play and I am sure she's enjoying it as much.
A108HSKN4NVC6C B009KS4XRO 3 1362960000 20 Its an okay Bingo game.  Wish I would of look more bingo games.  Probably will here soon.  I love Bingo.
A108HXCXJ320QZ B008K6GKW8 5 1357257600 20 It's a challange to not to fall in the Ice.... ugh love it.. learning the gam is a little hard
A108K09ULMUOZ1 B008JJS6D2 5 1372118400 61 I enjoy having this game on my Kindle. It's a great time killer and is easy to play. The pace of the bingo balls is great because I never feel flustered or unable to keep up. Plus, the daily bonus gives you enough coins to buy more bingo cards so that you do not have to spend real money to play.
A108K09ULMUOZ1 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1374364800 54 Great game so far. I'm only level 5, so it's still a little early to know for sure, but it seems to be a lot of fun. It doesn't seem like you would have to spend real money to advance so hopefully it stays that way. Graphics are cute and the storyline is humorous.
A108K09ULMUOZ1 B007SYWFRM 5 1374364800 54 I am only level 6 and I already love this game! Awesome graphics, you don't need to spend real money to play, and you never have to worry about energy in this game. You can play as long or as little as you want! I highly recommend this game for people of all ages.
A108K09ULMUOZ1 B00FEMJF6O 5 1384819200 59 I love this app so far. I adore CastleVille on FB and am glad to have a version on my Kindle. It's cute and fun and easy to play. I like that it's slightly different than the FB app. Otherwise it would be redundant and boring. I just hope Zynga brings more of their FB apps to the Kindle!
A108K09ULMUOZ1 B00BJSJKJ4 5 1377043200 43 I just downloaded this game today and already I love it. I never played the board game but now I want it. As for the kindle game, I really enjoy it. It's fun, challenging yet not overly so, and best of all free!
A108K09ULMUOZ1 B008MM9630 3 1372118400 86 This game was fun at first and I enjoyed playing it. The graphics are cute and I am partial to games involving magick and mythology. However, there is only so much that can be done in this game without spending real money, which is something I refuse to do. I uninstalled the game after a few weeks because I could no longer advance in it without spending real money. If you don't mind paying to advance then I recommend this game. Otherwise, don't bother downloading it.
A108MHLR25LOML B00659XNK4 5 1335225600 98 The 5SA wasn't organized as a joke, and it's unfortunate that it's even needed...but it is. With the increasing number of 1 star troll reviews, it is only a matter of time before all the quality developers are scared off (and eventually the cancellation of FAOTD all together).Its understandable if you're not comfortable giving 5 stars to an app you feel is poorly done, but add a star or two to negate the haters. Any little bit can help FAOTD to thrive and survive. Join the 5SA; add &quot;5SA&quot; in your post somewhere so we know its working.
A108MHLR25LOML B006XIR9KM 5 1334880000 20 I had to do a &quot;double take&quot;. Very solid, challenges the mind. Impresses through the duress, and dressed for success...breast-fest
A108MHLR25LOML B007OXASB2 1 1334016000 52 sure you download it for free, but 90% of the content is only accessible with Gems (which cost a ton of real money). If you play the game without caring about your bank account, you could easily spend $200 in the matter of days (no I'm not exaggerating). NOT for kids...easy uninstall.
A108MHLR25LOML B006VLNIFQ 5 1335571200 27 Tranquil and serene. Not much of a game, but it does its job. Find a happy place.Rated a bit higher to keep FATOD healthy (5 Star Alliance)
A108MHLR25LOML B006T4IJTK 5 1334793600 21 not bad at all...its safe to download and i like the touchscreen paddle...not a bad revamp of a classic at all.
A108MHLR25LOML B006WFM7U8 5 1335139200 72 The 5 Star Alliance (or 5SA) is going to make sure FAOTD continues. Join the alliance and insert &quot;5SA&quot; somewhere in your post. Its pretty common sense that legit app developers will inevitably avoid FAOTD if they think they're going to get a bunch of 1 star reviews. Lets get the developers motivated and want to participate with the FAOTD program by enticing them with good reviews. 5SA will save the day...
A108MHLR25LOML B0062YYSTW 5 1335484800 26 This app is well executed and has some delicious options. Recipes are cleanly formatted and organized.Rated a bit higher to keep FAOTD healthy (5 Star Alliance)!
A108NSWPU5AKP3 B00ASKP5PW 1 1360368000 25 This game kept treading and finally would not work.  After restarting everything. it gave me an error message and would not even start the game.
A108NSWPU5AKP3 B008VRQNIC 5 1353715200 20 Great to pass the time. It gets harder the longer you play.  Word, word, word, word word, word word.  Word.
A108NSWPU5AKP3 B0097GVJWQ 5 1360108800 20 Great graphics, fun puzzles and it is a long game. I feel I got my moneys worth. Great time waster.
A108PAYAIU0AW8 B0064ETS1I 3 1330560000 34 It is okay but it is also a bit boring. It is repetitive and could be better. There is no &quot;free play&quot; mode just endless goals. I wish there was a free play mode.
A108PAYAIU0AW8 B007ET5P4Q 2 1333584000 35 This app was more of an interactive book that is only interesting the first time you play it. Would only recommend if you like the "pick your own ending" book type. I personally was disappointed.
A108PAYAIU0AW8 B0071PARPA 5 1332979200 48 This app is awesome even for those like myself who cannot draw but love to anyway. The variety of pencils is good and the effects you can create are awesome. Even my 4 year old daughter loves to use it. Plus I couldn't beat the price of FREE!!!
A108PAYAIU0AW8 B007SYWFRM 5 1334880000 66 This game is a really cute take on the movie. I love how the theater really plays a movie. I have not been able to put it down since i have installed it. This game does not lock you in like others claim! Its not hard to figure out how to get out either. Just click on settings and the arrow will pop upat the bottom!
A108Q73O3YQG9F B008B84O6Y 5 1340841600 24 great game cant wait to play it more its soooo fun definitely recommend it if u don't have it u need to get NOW!!!!!!

A108Q73O3YQG9F B0080IOHLW 5 1337040000 22 this app is a great app to pass time you will forget how long you have been playing I definitely recommend it
A108Q73O3YQG9F B008Y212PI 5 1380499200 52 cool game I love this kind of grid puzzles just got it and want to go back to playing it and will as soon as I finish this review its a definite for any puzzle lover it has a few different difficulty levels I'm working on the 5 x 5 ones now
A108Q73O3YQG9F B0080K98U0 5 1341878400 37 Zenonia 4 is an awesome rpg I just loaded it earlier today and I don't want to stop playing it cant wait to finish this review so i can get back to playing I highly recommend it
A108Q73O3YQG9F B00BNH1PF8 5 1363478400 24 awesome game I played and enjoyed the first one this one is more fun and more puzzling as well you should definitely get it
A108QN0VQPX1W2 B005ZXWMUS 5 1362441600 20 How nice to lie in bed and watch a movie while remaining comfortable. The other choice was the disk computer.
A108QN0VQPX1W2 B00D74E5MA 4 1375747200 20 A great resource for planning a new home or apartment or redecorating one. Gorgeous photos give a variety of designs.
A108QN0VQPX1W2 B00APKROYK 3 1362441600 20 The variety in the pack gives me choices when I am tired but can't sleep and don't want to read.
A108QN0VQPX1W2 B00BOW41P8 3 1375747200 26 Unless you subscribe, most of the NYT news allows only 3 articles in full to read. More  can be gleaned from reading another app, USA Today,
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B007ZGO7EM 5 1384992000 22 What is better than a free app? Because I did not pay anything, it's even better! Works well and serves it's purpose.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B005ZFOOE8 5 1384992000 21 Always a pleasure to listen to good music on I heart radio. This app is our savior over seas! THANK YOU!
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B005ZXWMUS 3 1384992000 31 I didn't get to use this product very much because I am over seas at the moment. However, I will most likely download it again once I return to the US.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B004Q3CJQ0 2 1384992000 20 This app is not very strong and eats up battery life too much. I tried it and then deleted it.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B00529IOXO 2 1384992000 24 For some reason, this did not work very well with my Kindle. After a few tries, I gave up on it and deleted it.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B004H6WTJI 2 1384992000 23 I did not use this application very much. So I am giving it 2 stars. Nothing wrong with it, just didn't use it.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B0064X7FVE 5 1384992000 22 Always works well, I have had it on other devices and have never been let down. Good product, I would recommend it.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B009ZZDNT6 3 1384992000 38 It serves it's purpose but every time I open this app I am asked AGAIN if I wish to upgrade. I find that this is very annoying and am contemplating on deleting the app entirely because of this.
A108V4O9Z78DB5 B008XG1X18 5 1384992000 20 We love Pinterest and have it on our tablets and computers. It's almost addictive! Great app! I would recommend it!
A108VYEAGZT7XS B00FAPF5U0 5 1385683200 30 This app gives my wife and I a little competition time. I think it's great that it limits the time till you get extra lives. Grab this app its fun.
A108VYEAGZT7XS B00CJ95O2E 5 1372032000 28 This app has helped me extend and monitor my battery life on my Kindle HD. It has helped me extend the life of my battery by two days.
A108VYEAGZT7XS B00EHKJ60E 5 1404777600 8 Just as fun and frustrating as fairway solitaire
A108VYEAGZT7XS B00FAX6XQC 4 1386460800 33 Deer Hunter is a simple yet enjoyable game that the hunter will love. There is some challenges . This is a great game for hunting while stuck indoors during the cold winter months.
A108VYEAGZT7XS B008JK6W5K 5 1357344000 19 This app is enjoyable and brain taxing love it. The whole family can help and it can be hard.Czdunski
A108YVYGHOVXBF B00FAPF5U0 5 1385596800 20 Just s good way to relax and unwind. The different levels some are easy and some provide s real challenge.
A108YVYGHOVXBF B00BNH1PF8 5 1362441600 27 Really fun make you think fun to play with others when you get stuck. Played tbd first one looking forward to this one and hoping for more
A108YVYGHOVXBF B00BG3ID0Y 5 1362960000 27 This game has great pictures and  makes you think. A lot of fun. And play with my family and friends. Looking forward to more of these gsmes
A108ZOJGDYPES8 B00850NK6I 1 1361836800 20 Does not work for Kindle fire HD.  Explanation of product says will work with my Kindle Fire HD.  Not True
A108ZOJGDYPES8 B00D0VA0UQ 4 1375056000 23 This game is exciting and fun to play.  Helps keep your mind sharp on spelling and thinking. Would recommend for young and old.
A1090T7CEVPXES B007ZGO7EM 1 1359849600 46 I tried to download four calculator apps (two paid for, two free) and STILL don't have oneon my Kindle.  They were all corrupt and I was unable to download them.  Now I have togo through the whole rigmarole to get two whole dollars refunded.  VERY irritating!
A1090T7CEVPXES B0062R5GJ0 1 1361664000 22 I can't remember why, but I couldn't use this one, one of several I downloaded that didn't work.  Not a good idea.
A1090T7CEVPXES B00AA0TJO8 3 1388707200 29 I downloaded this one for a break from my beloved word games and it IS fun, I just can't find may way out of the firsthurdle!  No matter what.......
A1090T7CEVPXES B0097HSS4M 3 1363046400 21 This is a good app, simple, basic, easy to use.  It just doesn't have a LOT of ideas for your pictures.
A10938QNO7IYIB B007ZGO7EM 4 1397174400 54 Can't believe kindle comes with no calculator, I had to grab this and it's a great app. Just a bit too annoying are the ads. Geez, I get that it's free and this guys are trying to make a profit trough the ads, but do you have to make them that annoying and big?
A10938QNO7IYIB B00BS7E2E4 2 1397174400 22 it's fun to play but it has a lot of problems, not a polished app at all, I wish it was better
A10938QNO7IYIB B009HQ9UHC 2 1397174400 28 I played this a couple of times and didn't get hooked. I you were like me expecting to have as much fun as with angry birds, forget it
A10938QNO7IYIB B00B2V66VS 3 1397174400 20 I like this game, I don't love it though, but I like it. It's a little monotonous for my taste
A10938QNO7IYIB B0063IH60K 2 1397174400 29 I give it a low rating because this game is not very good. I appreciate the attempt and that it's free but it could be improved in every angle
A10938QNO7IYIB B008K6HN8I 5 1397174400 24 This app is great and has sooo many features I can't believe it. And it's free. Hats off to the ES File Explorer teem
A10938QNO7IYIB B0064X7B4A 3 1397174400 34 I don't find it quite amusing as other games. I have to say it's well constructed and intuitive though. But not a game for me, and I like games that make your neurons sweat
A10938QNO7IYIB B0087TQYUG 2 1397174400 22 I like the regular scramble game, the scramble with friends I think it needs more refinement on how the multiplayer dynamics go
A10938QNO7IYIB B007N5YIUS 5 1397174400 22 I love angry birds and the space twist was a really cool and refreshing feature. I wish they keep innovation moving forward
A10938QNO7IYIB B008JK6W5K 3 1397174400 36 This was a fun game although it has a lot of usability problems and restrictions. It is fun to play but I got annoyed at some issues then I stopped playing. Good to play in group
A10938QNO7IYIB B005KC664W 3 1397174400 22 another great game that could use a lot of UI improvements. It's fun to play but it really needs so design improvements
A10938QNO7IYIB B0067RQYNW 3 1397174400 32 I can't complain much because it's free and allows me to see the docs I want, but in terms of usability and look & feel it could get a lot of improvement
A10938QNO7IYIB B004TI2ZXY 2 1397174400 28 Maybe I'm so used to google maps that any other maps app just looks ugly and hard to use. I didn't like this app but it's well designed
A10938QNO7IYIB B008FRFN7A 3 1397174400 26 This looks like a cheap app. I allows me to print, that's why I give it 3 stars, but boy its ugly and hard to use
A10938QNO7IYIB B008JGSM6G 3 1397174400 20 It's a good concept for a game that this game is too easy. The UI isn't  the best designed either.
A10938QNO7IYIB B005V1N71W 5 1397174400 21 I love pandora, good music, great quality, streaming is great. The only thing is that I wish they had more artists.
A10938QNO7IYIB B004SJ3BCI 5 1397174400 22 I use to play this everyday, and I don't play a lot of games, but this game is highly addictive and fun.
A10938QNO7IYIB B00BGC5UAG 2 1397174400 27 I like this kind of game, there are many around that seem to copy each other. This is not the best one and there are several defects
A109DZBRNMT3CG B00FAPF5U0 5 1402963200 27 never thought I would like this kind of game...laughed. when people told me they would play for hours well now I am the one playing for hours!!!
A109DZBRNMT3CG B00823EFEY 4 1357516800 28 this is a fun app my 2 yr old enjoys it...think it would be better for an older child, also if you could draw with the kaleidoscope feature
A109H7JV8JIXDB B00EBQRZBG 5 1383868800 36 This game is great fun for the whole family to play. Some puzzles are easy to get, others are more difficult and will take the family to get it but you will all have fun playing.
A109H7JV8JIXDB B0063IH60K 4 1323388800 24 i really like the options it gives me to change table top, card picture and it gives me hints if I need help :)
A109H7JV8JIXDB B0075AJ3O2 5 1359158400 22 Pictures very colorful and beautiful. There are many different themes for you to choose from and they and they keep adding more:-)
A109H7JV8JIXDB B0055SWM08 5 1340236800 32 this is simple but fun. It has degrees of skill. Easy to learn along the way. Starts off easy and gets harder, but don't worry it has hints if you get stuck.
A109I262UKXTNB B00H3FNAOI 5 1391472000 27 There are many backgrounds to choose from and the calculator is wonderful too. I highly recommend this app if you want to change the way you calculate.
A109I262UKXTNB B0095MVOMC 5 1391472000 42 I love this app. It's a nice change from the usual hidden objects games. The numbers are mixture of very well hidden to where in the world is that last number. I highly recommend this if you are a hidden objects fan.
A109I262UKXTNB B009XFDFPU 5 1362528000 28 This game is great fun and additive!  I agree with other reviewers that the pop ups are a bit much, but other than that I enjoy the game.
A109I262UKXTNB B004UHSB5A 5 1329955200 31 I took the advice of another reviewer and read the instructions...believe me it makes a world of difference.  I'm not a big dominoes fan, but this was a lot of fun!
A109I29VULMHTY B00I8Q77Y0 1 1392076800 29 This game absolutely sucks flabby bird is way better. First the bird poops at random time. Second the bird is out of control. Third it's just flat out s***
A109I29VULMHTY B00992CF6W 1 1370476800 22 I can't get the new update ps if I knew how to it would be different story. Tell me if you know
A109IHUAX6BUKL B00IKZX1ZI 4 1399507200 20 The game is fun and enjoyable. I do not care the game wanting you to make purchases all the time.
A109IHUAX6BUKL B00CH26TL8 4 1397347200 23 My grandchild and I both find this game fun. It is easy enough for the very young and challenging enough for us oldies.
A109IHUAX6BUKL B0063IH60K 5 1379203200 26 Lots of fun. We have had other games that didn't work as well. Easy to use and never locks up. Even the grandkids enjoy this game.
A109KCRVW11AII B0086700CM 5 1343433600 119 1star people say this stincks and that 5star people  are lying a:why would we lie???? b: this game is awesome I had not expierienced any lagging on my kindle fire. this game is amazing. for newbies to the game it is a man that stole an idol from a temple and giant demon monkeys are after him.you swipe up to jump, side to turn, and down to slide. it goes faster the farther you go.there's bonuses to buy and collect as you run like invisibility and immortal wings. you tilt to collect coins to buy the bonuses and new charecters. do not listen to those one star jerks. they need to lighten up and have some fun in life.

A109PH5XBOGDIL B00A4O6NMG 5 1370563200 26 I love it the songs the monsters sing are really catchy. I recommend this game to everyone. I don't get how monsters hatch from eggs though.

A109WWW09QBRMN B00CJ8P82Q 5 1368921600 60 I used to play this type of game on my PC long time ago. Glad to see a version for Android. This works fine on my Samsung galaxy tab 2. This is very well designed. No crashes. I have to do most levels several times before I get a decent score. Thanks to the developers for a well made program.
A109WWW09QBRMN B009M6N37A 5 1392422400 74 I'm playing on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 10&quot;.  The graphics are beautiful. You can tilt and zoom the board. There are different kinds of symbols for the tiles. One is common household items, which made me think this would be good for young children learning to identify &quot;differences&quot; and &quot;likes&quot; and to name stuff.  I can find no negatives in this app. I commend the game maker for doing such a nice job.
A109WWW09QBRMN B008Y2FRFO 5 1378080000 111 Tips: Don't sell your prizes!  They are worth more when you get a collection.  Stack the coins! This game takes into account the weight of the items. If  your coins are single layer, they will not push larger objects as well as if they are stacked 3 or 4 high.  Also, you get a bigger bang when coins dump when they are stacked.  Finally, you can have some control over the path of objects.  If, for example, the game drops a larger prize coin close to the left side,  drop a single coin behind it against the wall. The smaller coin will push the larger coin towards the center. Good luck!
A109WWW09QBRMN B008IBIJTM 4 1371859200 48 Stop complaining about the app downloading all videos. Open the settings window and turn off downloading for Pete's sake.I am taking away one star because there is no setting for selecting to store downloads to the external memory - the SD chip.  Otherwise, this is a great app.
A109WWW09QBRMN B00FJYQUD8 5 1381708800 316 I am using a Samsung Galaxy Tab or rather a samsung galaxy note 2 and this works perfectly on it. The graphics are beautiful this sound effects are mesmerizing. The gameplay is easy and would be appropriate for a young child. The game is also educational because you have to buy fish with the money you earn in the game, so you live in a little bit about the kinds of fish that they have for the aquarium. You also get to buy plants and other things to make your aquarium look nice, and you get to buy things that are considered comfort items for the fish such is a light bulb and a filter and the bubbler and all that kind of stuff. I think that win the game asked me to pay bill real life cash to buy to pay for the to pay for the game, that I will probably buy it even though I'm 65 years old. And I have to tell you that I wrote this whole review using the voice to text technology on my samsung galaxy note 2. I love this thing. It's a lot easier to write on this is on a computer.yeah so maybe sometimes umm it doesn't write exactly what I wanted to say, but in this case chairs? I just need to fulfill my obligation to write a certain amount of words that I can go back to the game. On the other hand it's really fun watching the words appear on the screen as I talk that makes me want to just talk on forever just to watch the words appear magically. Thank you Mr robot for doing all this typing lissat here with my feet up on the table this beautiful young lady dropping bricks in my mouth all those okay. She's not really dropping bricks well, dropping grapes. So there you go.
A109WWW09QBRMN B006GIX2MI 4 1351987200 99 I have never played this type of game before. So I cannot compare to other games. The tutorial is thorough enough so that you are not left scratching your head.  The graphics are bright and high quality, very appealing to the eye. As others have said, I had some trouble selecting items on the screen, however, it was because I was pointing in the wrong spot. Once I understood where to tap, I did not have trouble selecting items.Unfortunately, the main theme of the game is  environmentalism.  If that is your gig, fine.  Otherwise, keep a barf bucket nearby.
A109WWW09QBRMN B008IXP8IU 5 1404172800 60 This game is relaxing and challenging. No score and no competition. Just peaceful puzzles.  The screen is colored light-tan, which is easy on the eyes.  A good example of minimalist design. Sometimes, simple is enough.  I will probably buy some puzzles. I think I can afford a dollar or two.  Remember the good old days when games cost fifty bucks?
A109ZLG1CJ2D1V B008X8QCTO 4 1368057600 33 I just got done with the game and ,I loved it ,the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars Is that it was so long to download.....I even played the bonus .......FUN,,,,,,,,,KATRE

A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B007OAGY40 5 1354406400 22 Nice port of an old favorite. Like all first person dual thumb games, control on a touch screen is problematic. Still fun!
A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B007N6NGYG 2 1364774400 35 If you like to continually fail at every level get this game. The timing tight and the switches are too close for small screens (i.e. Galaxy S III). Might be OK on tablet size screens.
A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B00942X8PY 3 1363219200 23 Simple, minimalist design and easy to understand rules creates an easy (and time time wasting) experience. Recommended for puzzle junkies and design snobs.
A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B009EEFTMC 2 1362009600 21 Fun at first and then boring. The timed mode is too difficult yet the puzzle mode lacks depth. Nice smooth graphics.
A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B00AK0X5VQ 5 1364774400 20 If you are even remotely considering this game, get it! The unique premise and simple design make this game perfect.
A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B005XQLBU4 4 1326672000 26 Nice game. Got it as the free daily download. You gotta see the nuke at least once. There needs to be an easier way to pause.
A10A0XM1WB0Y6T B009KEN87O 5 1363996800 21 Fun Space invaders type game. Many many levels. There are 3 difficulties. The invincibility power-up changes to a 3d perspective.  Fun.
A10A1FOXXG9OJJ B00AGOGOLE 5 1358035200 35 I like it.to bad not equipped to take picture's while you look at screen?device would've been a 5star in my book!! but I still like it,plus the younger ones are able to use shelf portrait!

A10A30YHF43D8U B00DJFIMW6 5 1387584000 21 when my daughter unlocked the mall and showed me what she had done on the mall I gaped it was huge.
A10A30YHF43D8U B00HDSYZ1C 5 1400889600 26 I love this app so much I can play it all night even my friend and sister mostly sitter sneaks my tablet just to play it.
A10A4ABXBGLK8C B00A6GNC1M 3 1387756800 203 I enjoy this game greatly, when I'm not dealing with glitches. I play on my kindle and these are what I've seen:the my team tab does not disappear during daily games making it impossible to get a bingo (cannot hit the bingo button, just lost two bingos in one round of the tournament today) because of the obstruction. The only solution so far is to uninstall the game, which I doubt anyone would want to do every day. You also won't know this until you have used your first free daily game round.Secondly, I have noticed that when you receive gifts from or send gifts to teammates the game does not seem to register it. Notifications in Facebook but no message within the game. Personally, I have noticed a big difference between the power-ups displayed as what I have available (lower) and the number it says I have (higher). I would conclude that power ups not &quot;purchased&quot; are being counted for use as available, though not truly available. If the game were more reliable I'd happily rate it better but because these glitches result in loss of progress, wins, and one of the benefits of teammates... Well, it doesn't warrant higher praises yet.
A10A4MK7ESZIG8 B008V06NRU 5 1379808000 26 I love my little pou he is a baby you can buy him close and food you can play with your friends and visit their house
A10A4MK7ESZIG8 B009ZKSPDK 5 1381968000 19 You get to  download other pepoles worlds you also get to puplish one and you also have misionses toCoupmlet
A10A52TUS5K7CV B00EW3STPY 1 1400457600 33 What a colossal waste!  On the free version you get one level open.  You have to pay for each and every other level.  Therefore, you end up paying, paying, paying.  What a crock!
A10A6T6SB04FFY B0073LWEXK 4 1381708800 62 This game is a lot of fun  Hard to put down or pause it.  This one they do have clues when you get stumped  The graphics are really good and once you find something it doesn't close back up or hang up the game.  Loved trying to figure out the puzzles.  Always something new to learn.  Finished the puzzle in few hours.
A10A6T6SB04FFY B005V1N71W 5 1379030400 46 I listen to any kind of music with Pandora on the computer, tv or kindle.  when you pick an artist they play similar selections of that style..  the options seem to be endless.  can use Pandora on some cell phones too.  no CD changing with Pandora.
A10A6T6SB04FFY B004FOA84A 5 1386633600 31 enjoyed the game very much.  was able to complete it and had a hard time taking a break.  want to try it again to see if I remember all the clues.
A10A8HQAQH0ZDJ B00G5LQ5MU 3 1384128000 29 on the second screen I was asked to rate it.rate it. rate it.I don't know if I like it or not.maybe my rating will change once I play it.
A10A8HQAQH0ZDJ B00IAQ3RJM 5 1402358400 20 I love this game!terrific matching game. different from several others. you should try it.cute little monsters.easy to get game money.

A10A9MNJ708LQU B00881VLCE 5 1402358400 42 This is the best puzzle game by far. The other ones don't even turn the pieces what is that about.? It has fantastic pictures as puzzles . I have tried the other puzzle games and I always come back to magic puzzles

A10AACYYMFFDSF B007VUA7VO 5 1341878400 31 I helps a lot with my old Kindle Fire.  Old one charger didn't work well so this helped how long I could play for x amount of time! USE THIS APP!!!
A10AACYYMFFDSF B006ON41FC 5 1329523200 26 I love the game and I do not know why there are haters. Just stop using Openfient or whatever it is called and ENJOY THE GAME!
A10AACYYMFFDSF B004GMJKTK 5 1336348800 26 It is very fun to play 1-2 players and the best thing is that the Kindle Fire can take it everywhere! It is a portapal gameboard!!
A10AACYYMFFDSF B004H2MGOU 5 1334966400 24 It is a very good and classical game that anyone will want to play even if you know that one trick to always win.
A10AACYYMFFDSF B0086700CM 5 1338249600 31 I never played it before and after I saw it was free I downloaded it and never had lag nor crash. So don't be hating because it is a good application.
A10ABATOE1LMSQ B009HKL4B8 3 1393459200 20 This was okay but it didn't keep me interested in it. You can try it and see what you think.
A10ABATOE1LMSQ B004XE06OY 3 1390867200 21 You have to really be good at this game. UIt was hard at first. then, I got the hang of it.
A10ABATOE1LMSQ B00CO6TOBY 3 1393372800 23 I think this game is more for the young adults that know all about electronics. I had a hard time with this game.

A10ABATOE1LMSQ B00D57N4O4 1 1397260800 36 This game is a pain. I have tried to get it to play about six times. It never connects. I went back to the beginning and it still won't play. I give up on this game.
A10ABATOE1LMSQ B008XG1X18 4 1393459200 22 If you want a lot of great ideas from cooking to doing things in you home this is the place to be.
A10ABATOE1LMSQ B00AVGGYNA 5 1393372800 24 I love to play bingo. Of course, I'm older than some of you. It's a fun game amd even more fun when you win.

A10ABATOE1LMSQ B00DRPVE3M 5 1393372800 25 I don't know of anyone who hasn't played uno. It's a fun card game. I love when you can zap the player next to you.
A10ABATOE1LMSQ B004O9G750 4 1393459200 22 Another games that kids would love to play. you have to break all the bubbles to get them to all come down.
A10AFBQAT9G7L3 B009UX2YAC 5 1362268800 24 Great game. I can't seem to put it down. Its like my addiction. I love it and I recommend everyone to download it now.
A10AFBQAT9G7L3 B00G357N92 5 1383696000 21 Great game!! This game is super addictive. I played it on the computer but it's so much better on the Kindle.
A10AFBQAT9G7L3 B00B2TET3C 5 1361059200 25 It's a family fun game! I would recommend it to my friends and family. I give it five ( 5) stars!!! Everyone go download now!
A10AFBQAT9G7L3 B00AA87JGU 5 1364774400 26 It's a very interesting game. I had it on the iPhone first then decided to download it here. I recommend everyone to download this game now.
A10AFBQAT9G7L3 B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384041600 23 This is a really good game! This game keeps your mind going and keeps you on your toes! Everyone should download this game.
A10AFYY4S55M3G B00881VLCE 5 1397606400 31 We are puzzle lovers and this is so fun with the many puzzles offered.  It is hard to stop just as in hands-on puzzles.  The colors are very vivid and appealing.
A10AFYY4S55M3G B006RXD2I6 5 1333584000 58 The Collection has so many choices to play.  It can keep you busy for years to come!  The display is easy to see and having the display of "playing the game" where you can see how it works is wonderful.  Thanks for the wide array of choices.  Had this for a month and just getting good and started.
A10AFYY4S55M3G B00D948SS0 5 1397606400 20 I love this game as it is very challenging.  I would recommend it to anyone who like word search games.
A10AFYY4S55M3G B00514DIE0 5 1333584000 55 This game is my all-time favorite.  You can change the display in so many different designs which makes for change as I play this one all the time!!!  I love a challenge and this one qualifies.  I leave it set at the hard level, but sometimes have to have some help with the "suggest" button.
A10AFYY4S55M3G B007VU3R5C 5 1337904000 49 My mom and I love the Mahjong Solitaire.  It is easier to see than other tile games and so many different designs to choose from.  I have been through the choices many, many times.  Actually, this is one of my very favorite games.  My 83-year-old mom loves it too.
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B009EEFTMC 5 1364342400 173 This game has 2 different modes, Puzzle and Cube Attack, so depending on how you wish to play, it can be relaxing, or it can be challenging. In the puzzle mode, you match the pairs, and unlike Mah Jong, they don't have to be &#34;free&#34;, they can be in the middle of a row, etc. In this mode you are given you time when you are done and you can post it,check the leaderboard, try to beat it next time, or you can ignore it and just have fun. In the Cube Attack mode, it is kind of like a 3-d Tetris game where you start with a small cube and have to keep making matches before you get a large cube and the game is over.Because the game is a 3-d type game, you can &#34;rotate&#34; the cube to look for matches, making it easier to find them. As a Senior, I enjoy playing in the puzzle mode, sometimes trying to beat my record, other times just wanting to play for fun.
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B008CPZNL6 5 1340582400 59 I love this app! While I can't compare it to similar ones, I can say that I like being able to pick what sources I am going to read and have it linked with Facebook. I haven't had any problems with it crashing or force closing. I am using it on a Coby Kyros tablet and it works great!
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B0063IH60K 5 1330300800 24 Downloaded this on my Kyros tablet and love it! Smooth moves, no hang ups and just plain fun! A great download for all ages.
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B008IXP8IU 5 1366243200 71 This is a fun game that makes you think. The puzzles are easy enough to begin with, and then increase in difficulty a little bit at a time. Sometimes the words are very easy to figure out, and other times, when you finally do figure it out, you wonder how you didn't see the solution sooner. I think it is a great way to exercise your brain without straining it :)
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B00JV858HM 5 1398988800 125 I have seen this advertised and being a word game fan, was thrilled to see it available. It is addictive right from the start, and I can see why so many people have given it a high rating. You have to put the words in the correct category....simple you say, but that is when you find out why it's called Red Herring. There are words that could be in a category but aren't...they are the Red Herrings, put there to trick you. If you enjoy word games, such as 7 Little Words, by the same developer, you will enjoy this game. There are no time limits and you don't have to buy clues. You start with 50 free puzzles and can purchase more later on.
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B00A04F8NU 4 1358294400 65 I downloaded this for the kids to play and find myself playing it every once in a while. It is definitely geared to kids, but if you change how you find the objects to using shadows or outlines, it can be challenging for adults. The story is ok, from an adult point of view, and maybe it is great from a kid's point of view.
A10AG3O76QWLE0 B00E1GOGJK 4 1386547200 72 I enjoy the challenge of the game but do find it frustrating at times....would be nice if you could get hints for less &#34;coins&#34;, especially when you have been stuck on the same picture for a week. LOL  It begins easy and I find it gets progressively harder as you move on. Never quite sure what the connection is at first, but once you find it, you can feel kind of silly.
A10AK6GLR4MEW1 B00A04GA14 5 1378857600 41 Please put more updates or contract killer 3 as long as you h ave more this is the game I play the most but let it be easier to get glu coins and money then it really would be the best
A10AK6GLR4MEW1 B00EQ0CKRQ 5 1384041600 46 This is one of the best asphalt games ever I've played 5 and 6 but eight is my favorite it has the best online too but the only thing wrong is that you barely get money and cars are expensive but I give it 5 stars
A10AK6GLR4MEW1 B00APKHA9Y 5 1380326400 56 This game is the best zombie apocalypse game ever created so far and I first found out about it when my friend told me about it and so I download it and it's  super addictive I'd spend all day playing this  that's how cool it is can't wait to download dead trigger 2  thanks for listening!
A10AKU7TMYE3HA B0091REZMW 2 1357689600 20 the instructions are inadequate and when entering it doesn't necessarily enter and you have to repeatedly input the same thing.
A10AKU7TMYE3HA B0063GORYU 5 1403136000 46 This app is exceptional.  You have one ad at the very beginning that you are able to skip, if you don't want to see it.  Aside from that ad you have the game which is not interrupted.  I would recommend this app to any and everyone.
A10AKU7TMYE3HA B00HYL0AAI 4 1394928000 39 This app gives you a nice variety of slot games.  Different games offer different types of bonuses.  If you play reasonably smart, and don't try to &quot;break the bank&quot; on every turn, your credits will last quite a while.
A10AKU7TMYE3HA B00HFTHXMC 3 1391126400 33 This app is worth the price.  It uses up time while you are waiting for something to do that is worthy of your time.  It is no challenge, but the graphics are excellent.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B0064TVQ5E 4 1398816000 31 Lots of choices for the tiles and the kind of game anyone wants to play....lots of fun.  The hardest part if making up your mind which  way you want to play....lol.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00HFTHXMC 5 1399248000 22 So far this is my favorite match three game.  If I could I would hours playing but the family won't let me.I.ca
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00FIP4SLO 4 1394668800 43 Just started playing this game and it's fun and so far easy, but I have had to stop and think a little harder as the game proceeds in levels.  I suspect that I will be meeting much tougher hints as the game progresses.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00AREIAI8 4 1395792000 22 Great graphics and real life fun with my horse....this is the closest I'll ever get to owning and tending my own horse.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00DUVQIIY 3 1404691200 51 I find this hard to play because the hidden objects are way to small.  I do play hidden object games a lot on my computer so the only complaint I have is the size of the objects to find in this app are just scaled down too small for my eyes.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00HEFEDAM 5 1395792000 38 This is a perfect match game for my Kindle....Always there and lots of fun to play, but also addictive to the point that I stay up way past my bedtime in order to play one more level, lol.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B0064X7B4A 5 1404691200 29 Scramble at it's finest.  I love playing against friends on my friends list.  I like that I can play with each person in multiple games at the same time.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00AR1AUAW 4 1398816000 35 This game makes you think hard and other times it makes you scratch your head with the matches the games chooses.  It's lots of fun if you don't let the time clock get to you...
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00FZUF5VY 1 1404691200 9 Don't like slot games and didn't download this game.
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00GY0HJ4K 5 1395792000 22 match 3 games are my favorite when I don't want to think too hard about anything and this one fills the bill
A10AMAR18JLUN7 B00BXPQN2K 4 1404691200 41 Love this game.  It's all about building a civilization which brings out the farmer in me.  Uses a lot of energy credits for each task performed so it doesn't take much play before you are out of energy to do anything.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0064TVQ5E 2 1398988800 24 Okay, but once I found Mahjong Solataire, all other Mahjong apps fail in comparison. Not a bad game, just found one I like better.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0094BB4TW 1 1398988800 157 I have deleted this app from my phone as they have made navigation annoying. In my opinion, Most Recent should always run on my news feed instead of Top Stories. Unless I go under the &#34;More&#34; section and hit Most Recent, I can end up with posts from several days ago. Upon reviewing the permissions this app wants, I will never put it on my phone again regardless of any improvements they make. The permissions they are requesting are ridiculous and unreasonable and a privacy violation in my opinion. None of these apps should have permission to make calls, record video, read texts, etc. Some of us do business on our phones, and FB does not have the right to snoop around on my phone and know my business dealings. It is just Social networking, unless they are secretly working for the Government, lol! FB just isn't worth the time anymore, and this app makes it worse.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B008CPZNL6 5 1398988800 142 I have used this App for several years on many different devices and phones. I like how easy it is to customize the news you want to read. I do not read Entertainment news, or Business news, so it is nice not having to scroll through topics such as those that I do not want to read. You can also change your choices at any time. This app also connects to your social networking if you choose. I prefer to Facebook from here, as Flipboard is in magazine format, so it's like relaxing and reading a post from a friend instead of spending endless amounts of time just scrolling thru Facebook. This app also doesn't ask for as many permissions as Facebook. No lag between pages, easy to read and nice lay out. It's like getting a magazine custom made for you.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00A4KVFLY 1 1397692800 30 I tried to load this onto a brand new KindleFire HDX and it did not load correctly. I have not had trouble downloading any other games, apps, music, books, etc.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00D74E5MA 5 1398124800 38 This app is easy to use and is fun, even if you are not currently into a redecorating project. You can browse others ideas, create, save and share. Very functional and no lagging in between screens. Highly recommend.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B009G9KFQ0 5 1398988800 31 Whenever I get a new gadget that has the WeatherBug app available, I download it. I have always found the information from this app to be up to date and reliable.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B004R7C0QY 5 1398816000 55 This did not want to download correctly, but once it did I have really enjoyed it. Of course it's not as thorough as the bound book field guide, but good enough, and very easy to navigate. It was on sale too, so you can't beat that. The facts and photos are good quality and informative.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00AUXZJAS 5 1398816000 80 After playing the free version a few times, I upgraded to the Pro because it tracks your improvement. Definately worth the $4.99 I paid. I was surprised I'm better at facial recognition/memory than what I thought, and surprised at some of my weaker areas also. :) I think these Mind Games were well thought out and  produced. They are both entertaining and stimulating and great exercise for the brain. This is my favorite out of all the brain training apps.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B008XAKC98 3 1403395200 89 When this app works it is amazing and flawless, especially since it is free. However, it is not always consistent and closes on me often when I'm originally trying to open it. When it does open correctly, it streams perfectly and has a huge variety of shows to watch. It has never closed on me while watching something. I will keep it since it does have potential, I would just suggest not having your heart set on watching something from this app as it may or may not open.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B008D29K7G 2 1405123200 31 I hate this App on my KindleFire, love it on my Smartphone. On my phone I can watch Fox livestreaming but not on my Tablet. Why cant they be the same?
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00B9AGS42 2 1401840000 75 I downloaded this App for my Kindle Fire HDX, and some of the items were so tiny, or so lost in the shadows, you could not find them without a hint. I like games to be challenging, but making them impossible is ridiculous. Even when you asked for a hint and it circled the item for you, you still had trouble finding the  item! I showed some friends and they couldn't find things sometimes either.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00DREKMPO 5 1397001600 20 Seems to do a good job. Haven't had any issues yet. Very pleased, especially just using the free functions. :)
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B006ID7U4C 5 1397001600 38 Very nice App. Try this to see how well you like it before you upgrade to the pro version. Pro Version is not very pricey at all. This is my favorite Tarot app. Beautiful and set up well.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0093QQCGI 2 1397692800 58 This is an OK app. It is not set up as nicely as some of the others. However, since CNN's news coverage has gone downhill since the plane went missing, I have deleted this app and have not found myself lacking in news from other news apps. Sometimes this CNN app functioned correctly and sometimes it did not.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00B63HT8Q 5 1405468800 30 Very accurate and up to date radar display. Display is clear on my Kindle Fire, and does not lag or hesitate. More accurate than our local weather forecast. Highly recommend.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0087SGWI6 5 1398816000 20 Worth the $4.99 to purchase the Pro version. You will not be disappointed. This is my favortie brain training app.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0066T8M1I 5 1398988800 81 A great version of the classic board game. You can play by yourself against the computer, or do pass and  play. Graphics and options are excellent and clear and there isn't any lag during play. The token movements are enjoyable to watch as they go around the board. If you love the original board game of Monopoly, this is the App to get! Hours of play, and saves your game so you can stop and then continue at a later time.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B004K4RY9M 4 1398038400 99 Interesting word lists. Clear and easy to read puzzle. Easy to circle the words, unlike other puzzles where you have to try several times to get it to hold the circled word. It is set up like the typical Search A Word, where the larger words are found around the frame of the puzzle and one or two words running diagonal in the middle. I found some of the shorter words actually to be the hardest to find. I like where you can pick up where you left off. Very good especially for free. No annoying ads or pop-ups.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00I3D27CU 2 1405468800 49 Too wordy. I guess I'm used to the old Choose Your Own Adventure books, where after a few short paragraphs, the reader gets to make a decision. I love to read, but with this, it was too much reading before having the chance to feel interactive with this book.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0062AX2DE 5 1397001600 53 Inexpensive to pay for the upgrade. Very nice colors and set up. Choice of several spreads and the option to save your readings. I enjoy Tarot even if I don't fully believe in it, as it sometimes makes you think of things and possible options in a way you might otherwise have not.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00FIW5BZE 5 1396310400 68 This game is very enjoyable and there are hundreds of layouts with a new &#34;one day only&#34; layout every day. You can earn stars for completing a puzzle within a time limit and not asking for a hint, but I just play simply for my own enjoyment. This is a MUST to have if you enjoy playing Mahjong. I promise it will give you hours of interesting play.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00E5NH6YG 5 1397433600 60 I downloaded this to my KindleFire HDX thinking it would not work well. It works exactly as described. I am beyond pleased with this and you will not be disappointed if you are a fan of the Lifetime Channel. Keep checking back to it, as movies and shows change, and some shows are shown special for a limited time. Excellent!
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00GRPD0J0 5 1405987200 37 This app works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. You can also set up alerts at the top of your Kindle Fire to let you know an e-mail arrived while you are using something else on your tablet.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B008XME36E 1 1397001600 32 For my taste, I was only able to find two free books I was interested in and I haven't read them yet, so the verdict is still out. Very lame and disappointing.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00AMR1HZ8 3 1397433600 64 I really enjoy this game and you get your moneys worth. The graphics and sound are great, and it's fun to create and dress your own character. However, I found this game to be just a bit too easy to play and if you are any good at the television version of this show, you will almost always win every round on this App.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B0091QSNEE 5 1397001600 39 Fun...always fun. I have so many of these games on my phone, and even as an adult I thoroughly enjoy them. I think children would be delighted with these. The graphics are excellent and the food selections are nice.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00BNH81FU 2 1397433600 88 This app is just okay. You get a few categories free and then they want 99 cents a piece for every little thing. I don't cook much and just wanted a basic cookbook, but with the price of the extras I wanted, it would have turned into a 12 dollar app! There is also no way to search for SPECIFIC recipes. For example, you can go under the BREAD category, but not search for the specific type of bread recipe you are looking for, you must scroll through.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00A7Z8KAU 5 1401840000 138 I have this on my Apple iPad, and was delighted to discover it was available for my Kindle Fire HDX. There is a slight, but easy learning curve with this App, but it can bring hours of enjoyment, whether you are seriously trying to create a decent piece of art, or just playing around. This is one of the first Apps I looked for when I got my new device. I love it that much. As someone who does enjoy painting on canvas, I appreciate this for simply being able to create whenever I want and not feel like I'm wasting my precious supplies when I make a mistake. Sometimes I work my ideas with this app before putting them on canvas. And again, it's a nice app just for fun too and not overly complicated to learn.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00BI60DMU 2 1403222400 62 Not my favorite channel on television, but the app does well. If you are a fan of the show Friends, then get this app. I like catching  Big Bang Theory with this App on my Kindle Fire, but again, the channel is not one of my favorites. App works pretty decent. Sometimes it is slow but that might be on my end.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00GGOVTN6 1 1397520000 26 I ordered 3 Starter Packs and only one downloaded. Otherwise this would be an excellent game. I'm really enjoying it, I just want my starter packs.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B004ANMWPY 1 1396310400 54 Set up was quick and easy but it had the listings in the wrong time zone. I uninstalled it and re-installed it, and it was still incorrect. My cable company is small, and although this app had it listed as a choice, it did not have the correct information for the television show listings.
A10ANCEOWK5GBN B00HA8WNZ0 5 1397692800 58 A very enjoyable and pleasant and relaxing game. Yet, it is stimulating to your mind. A nice game to play when you just want to pass time and relax a little. The colors and music are also very nice. I would also recommend the game Color Zen if this kind of game is the kind that interests you.
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B00CKW6FVE 2 1392336000 24 I downloaded by mistake. What I wanted was Tetris without the Blitz. Even without the Blitz, Tetris without arrow keys doesn't work for me.
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B008MAGJTQ 1 1396742400 45 This is not a game. It is an app demonstrating/advertising a game for you to buy. Do not waste your time downloading. I tried 2 - 3 times to get to a game I could actually interact with, then deleted it from my Kindle Fire.
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B00636V5CM 1 1393459200 91 To myself I should say, &#34;Duh!&#34; Why would I think I would get a free app for something that requires a paid subscription? I'm not sure what I thought I would be getting, but what I got was nothing. If you have a PAID subscription to People Magazine, I assume the free app downloads it or some part of it. I assume. I do not have a paid subscription to People Magazine, have no intention of getting one, so the app is useless. I deleted it within the first five minutes.
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B008DYK0I2 5 1385942400 68 Easy to install, easy to open (once I located my U-Verse password!), and streamed nicely on my Galaxy S4.  While checking it out by  watching a football game, I was amused to note that the app is several seconds ahead of the TV, which has a built in delay to allow bleeping out of anything offensive (and which also makes wardrobe failures and bad language on TV inexcusable).
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B004VMUS9G 5 1366761600 29 I have not had to use it, but testing it out, it seems fine.  It is on my Kindle Fire, and I just hope it works away from home.
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B004GMT14Y 4 1378684800 72 Is it acryllic or acrylic? vacuum or vaccuum? recommendation or recomendation? We text and email on the go, and who wants to carry a 5 pound volume around. It's FREE. It offers acronyms and other handy information. For me, it would be even handier if it went straight to the dictionary when it opens rather than to a page of trivia pursuit, but to each his own. Don't leave home without it!
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B00FEIX5OG 5 1396742400 131 When all else fails, read the instructions! If you start playing without knowing there is a key to expose (like I did), and that the key is supposed to be maneuvered to the bottom, the game seems utterly pointless. Just moving spots on a screen. Once you know what you are supposed to be doing, it becomes a challenge. With each new stage, the challenge increases. I am especially pleased that it does not limit your attempts (like Candy Crush), cut you off from playing (as Candy Crush does) or try to sucker you into buying more time (like Candy Crush). You simply play as long as you like, quit when you want to, and when you go back to it later, it remembers where you left off. Caution--it is addictive!
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B004SBQGHS 4 1366761600 42 I have this on my cell phone, but hard to aim on such a small screen. More fun on Kindle Fire--but should I have got it free, since it was already on the cell phone? Oh, well--great fun for only 99 cents.
A10APFU4SBMAM1 B00FAPF5U0 2 1389225600 95 I already had this on my cell phone, and at least on the kindle the &#34;candy&#34; is large enough to avoid some of the &#34;fat-fingering&#34; and to actually see the &#34;jelly.&#34; The original download is &#34;free,&#34; but after you reach the more difficult, seemingly impossible levels, it starts offering assistance for $.99 a pop. To frustrate you into buying these, after so many failed attempts, it shuts you out completely for a while. I'm not falling for it. What difference does it make whether I slide colored buttons around on level 30 or level 130?
A10AQ8K76Z3XX0 B007TNQ7EY 5 1334275200 21 it is a great game and worth the price. runs smoothly on kindle fire but takes up a ton of space
A10AQ8K76Z3XX0 B007Q3GY1S 5 1336176000 21 asked dad if he knew about this and he jumped out of his seat!! so much fun! and its the FAOTD
A10ASD3AX15W6Y B005V1N71W 5 1367971200 34 love it don't listen to anybody else app works just fine.. the only thing I don't like is in free version of it they limit your lisioning time to so many hours per month
A10ASD3AX15W6Y B007V2UGPE 3 1335225600 29 fun but he auto attacks witch I hate. also if u die they want u to but a revival ticket using real money or else u lose the game
A10ASD3AX15W6Y B005UOK2KY 2 1339891200 33 games kinda cool for a while but after 5 min its sucks and its a waste of 2 dollars. in stead go out and buy a couple cheese burger's off the dollar menu
A10ASD3AX15W6Y B008PFPKWU 1 1379030400 29 just to be fair this games a good game buy. in order to play it tho u have to have wi. fi .....and it laths even with wi fi
A10ASD3AX15W6Y B00632HWOG 1 1355529600 36 this app wont even let me sign in to view my email since update please fix.this app is compleate trash and waste of space since update don't get worthless unless u like a lot of agrevation
A10ASD3AX15W6Y B006YC74E8 5 1380758400 33 This app is an incredable app...I'm surprised its free with all the cool features like clone....u can adjust Color, the hue....also has a fun sketch effect... check it out highly recomendee..and its free
A10AU9KJTV5KZM B00A757EFW 4 1382400000 23 Back to the 80's. All that's lacking is a joystick. Seems that nothing was changed from the original game in an Atari console.
A10AU9KJTV5KZM B00CH87HF4 5 1369353600 34 Feels like Diablo with good graphics. Very fast game play. Simply the best rpg game played yet. But still items or gems must be bought by real money which should the fun a bit.

A10B2GB2DS9374 B00696GNC8 5 1326931200 30 This book is great.  It acts like a pop up book on the Kindle Fire.  It is interactive and just adorable.  I highly recommend it. Fun for the whole family!
A10B7U5R245SMG B00BOUROR2 3 1380412800 24 Game play is average.Small cards more difficult to control than necessary.Having multiple solitaries a plus.One to keep in cloud but not on my K-Fire
A10B7U5R245SMG B0064ETS1I 5 1330992000 30 Decent graphics with a number of differing goals to achieve.  Tap quickly to catch thieves in your stores. With time you learn which store combinations can make a successful strategy.

A10BC4KBUIP8HT B009G41CG2 5 1391472000 38 I really like searching for the pairs , there are so many version of this game . I have two different ones and I like them each for different reason , I might look at some other ones

A10BC4KBUIP8HT B006P2Y2QK 2 1388275200 25 Got this game for my husband but he didn't like it only because he wanted the cards to look more traditional ...so just a preference
A10BC4KBUIP8HT B00514DIE0 5 1388275200 28 I was so excited to see it available for my Kindle . I have it on my PC and came across it on Amazon ..It is really fun
A10BC4KBUIP8HT B00GDADUPS 4 1391817600 30 I wanted something different to play . This takes planing and thinking alright ....I like even though I have to restart a few times before I get my 3rd star

A10BD0288TGRVS B0069G5Z9K 4 1393372800 27 Great game app! My children love playing it on their Kindle Fire. They have had the kindles for quite awhile now and it is a perennial hit!
A10BDTZFOYSGJS B006C1ZSO4 5 1325462400 35 people need to shut up...this is a really good game and its not like its really cutting off your finger! so I.don't get how its nasty! if u.don't have.anything nice to say don't say anything!!

A10BDTZFOYSGJS B0061SLW7A 5 1329004800 21 I luv this!!! it understands almost everything I say!! and you can change the avatar!!!!! great job also please add jokes
A10BF725TSO18R B007SYWFRM 5 1373328000 26 This is one of the best games I have played in a long while. I am glad I downloaded it and I am enjoying it thoroughly.
A10BF725TSO18R B00ANH526W 1 1378339200 141 I spent a long time completing quests in the game, and building up my house with furniture, more rooms, recruiting more sorority members, etc., and then I get to one quest where I am supposed to buy for my sorors 2 pieces of event clothing. One piece, I bought, and then I tried to buy the other piece, which was a studded black jacket, and it kept saying 'download first'. :-/ All I should have had to do is pay for it, but when I'd click 'buy', that 'download first' message is what I kept getting, and I cannot complete the quest without that dumb jacket. -_- I hope you all can fix this glitch in the game so I can move past it and continue to play, otherwise, I'll have no choice but to delete the game from my device.
A10BF725TSO18R B00E8KLWB4 5 1377820800 25 I am so happy I found this game on Amazon.com this evening. I've been playing for an hour nonstop and I love it so much.
A10BF725TSO18R B00H91MUHY 5 1391904000 204 You know what? after reading so many bad reviews of this game for any number of reasons, I still felt I wanted to try it out for myself as I own all Sims games since Sims 1 (for PC), and I've also had Sims 2 for PSP as well as Sims 3 Pets for XBox 360. Everyone keeps saying how much better Sims Freeplay is. I wouldn't necessarily say it's better, but just that it is different. I love this game right here though. It's different, I love everything about it, and I don't mind that it cost $6.99. I didn't mind paying that at all and I feel that I got my money's worth. It's a great game. It's available for Kindle Fire and I have had no problems whatsoever with it. It's not slow at all. Very happy with my purchase. I encourage others to try it who love Sims 3 and want yet another way to play the game. Don't expect it to be just like Sims 3 for PC. It's for Kindle Fire/Android. Expect it to play for this device. Don't compare it to game play on other devices. I think it's an awesome game. Thanks, EA and Sims 3!
A10BF725TSO18R B00IZLM8MY 5 1396742400 58 I was so happy to wake up today and find 'High School Story' on Amazon.com (games) so I can play it on my Kindle Fire. It's a very awesome game and I have spent a lot of time on it so far today. It deserves a 5 star rating totally. I love it! love it! love it! X-D
A10BF725TSO18R B00GGOVTN6 3 1386028800 74 Everything was coming along nicely for me in game, until today. My closet value somehow went to $0. I know that my closet value earlier today was at least $17,000. I worked hard to get to that point. What happened to my account? The other thing is why are such low stars given to great looks? Jealousy of other players, maybe??? Please return my closet value to me, or I will uninstall this game!
A10BG33BQIR7XI B004SOR4H6 5 1400025600 36 Everyone uses Twitter, so here is where I got to experience it.  I had tried to use twitter on my other computers, but this app is so easy.  Makes you want to tweet all the time.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B008YU0AOE 4 1380758400 61 I liked it best when I first installed it because it had large buttons and no scientific stuff on it.  But the next time I used it it had all those things that I have no idea what they are used for. Someone who needs that stuff would benefit from them but I just want to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B006KX3GXO 2 1392768000 49 I felt it was too complicated for me to figure out how to do everything. Plus all the ads were annoying.  I hate ads crawling across when I try to do something.  So I just felt that it needed to go before I wasted too much of my time.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B008L1A68Q 5 1383436800 58 Of class I like scramble so this is great.  I never have anyone to play my board game with.  And this has solved my problem.  My board game can stay in the closet for 20 more years.This Game is so easy to play alone or with someone else.  It's a easy learning app.  Works good  on Kindle Fire.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B007K8RFJ4 1 1400025600 30 I had some problems with this associating with my Roku so I uninstalled it.  It was nice to use the first time but then the next time it froze up.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B00GY0PQZ4 4 1392768000 42 I just downloaded tho game and I enjoy word games. This seems to be a Good game I can keep working up a higher challenge. It progressively gets harder the further I go.  I will probably be playing this one quite awhile.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B00BJSJKJ4 5 1378684800 102 I have spent hours playing this game.  It is great for online or offline enjoyment.  I take my Kindle Fire to my doctor appointments with me.  I know I am going to be there waiting for at least an hour. (They are never on time).  I can play this game without wi-fi access and it is just as good to keep me entertained. I would recommend this to anyone who likes word games and wants to keep their brain active.  That is why I started playing this game. To give my mind some exercise. And I am building my vocabulary back up.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B00BXOAX40 5 1381622400 56 I recently found this for my Kindle Fire and I am pleased it works just as well here as on my computer.  Great app.  I love it that I can sit and watch tv and still play some of my favorite games. Now just get some of my other lungs games and I will be happier.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B00BI60DMU 1 1402963200 105 My cable company Isn't listed to use this app.  I can watch the same content on the laptop free without having to go through that sign in carp anyways, it's just that if you want to watch it on the big screen tv you have to use the cables which you have to admit is a pain in the butt.  Same goes for all the channels Roku offers.  Seems that if we are supposed to be getting free television by having Roku, we should not have to &quot;EVER&quot; sign in to a app for free channels or ones you pay for already on cable station.
A10BG33BQIR7XI B006DU97XC 5 1382227200 29 GREATEST APP I HAVE ON MY KINDLE FIRE.. I USE IT EVERY DAY.  IT IS BETTER THAN MY TV GUIDE.  I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL ABOUT THS APP.
A10BQH0ZQ458O B009HUBJPO 5 1359590400 27 I think everyone should get this app it's free and you don't even need a account. No personal information I have this app and I love it.
A10BQH0ZQ458O B00BS3UFCQ 5 1366502400 22 So if you love movies this is he app for you  it is so cool that you can guess the Oscar movies
A10BQH0ZQ458O B00529IOXO 5 1350864000 62 This app is awesome I think of you have a kindle you should get this app you can send pics the only let down is that you can't send music videose.I give this a 5 star and to all you people who gave it a 1 star. YOU R WRONG. Cause it works on my that means your kindle is jacked up
A10BS065D6B04T B004DM1OAQ 5 1353369600 31 let's face it, who doesn't love backgammon!  i love this game & play it often.  can you do it w/ other players though?  i'm not sure but that would be fun!
A10BS065D6B04T B00DHKKN6Q 1 1374364800 46 It might be a free ap, but you have to buy coins and I'm just NOT Going to do that! The bow was hard to get used to but ok in the end. I think I'm just going to delete the ap, tired of struggling. Sorry.
A10BS065D6B04T B006PK2TEE 1 1376611200 31 I have to say that I'm not a fan of this game. Not very challenging, there are definitely much better word search games that are out there that I happily replay!
A10BS065D6B04T B00A4KVFLY 1 1364083200 22 sometimes this game is absolutely redidulous ! the anawers dont make sense ! who comes up with these questions and answers ?
A10BS065D6B04T B00BMK357W 1 1369094400 21 For some reason I can't get past level 17, I've tried repeatedly but not successful so I deleted it,sorry! Very disappointed
A10BS065D6B04T B0060D80NU 1 1354665600 20 This is not a very fun game, didn't enjoy it immediately deleted it from my kindle. Sorry I tried it!
A10BS065D6B04T B0087TQYUG 4 1380412800 63 Like all Zynga games I love this one! However, I do NOT like the COIN THING! I have found the game RUZZLE that doesn't make you buy coins, which I will NEVER do! Ruzzle doesn't give you the option to &quot;freeze, prompt, etc&quot; but that's ok with me, I like not having to rely on help! I do play both of these games.
A10BS065D6B04T B0064X7FVE 1 1374451200 31 Sorry folks,do NOT like the new weather channel format! It's a bunch of useless junk!I know they won't do it but please bring the old format back! Keep it simple stupid!
A10BS065D6B04T B00A9JG6RS 4 1355961600 50 so far i haven't been able to find directions, instructions on how to play this game.  i'm winging it!  i'd like to know more details but not sure if i have access to that.  i keep playing it so i guess i like it!  it's not the bubble game tho...
A10BS065D6B04T B0094FYBB6 1 1354665600 21 Sorry didn't like this game one bit!  I like all the other zynga games but not this one!  Sorry I tried
A10BS065D6B04T B00FAPF5U0 2 1382832000 45 Sorry to disappoint people but this game just has too many levels that you can't win! I don't know how people get past certain levels, maybe they pay, I'll NEVER do that!  May just have to delete, I've known people who have done just that!
A10BS065D6B04T B009VSW15Y 1 1355961600 33 ok, it's only a few bucks but i'm not sure why i bought it!  it doesn't do anything that i didn't know my kindle fire did w/o it.  oh well, live & learn.
A10BS065D6B04T B00IAQ3RJM 5 1404777600 33 At first I wasn't too sure about this game but it SERIOUSLY grew on me! I like playing against family and friends and it's not hard and frustrating like some other popular games!
A10BS065D6B04T B0094BB4TW 5 1355961600 20 of course i'm gonna like this, NO, love it!  easy access to my friends/family on facebook helps a bunch!  thanks
A10BS065D6B04T B006MI4JEM 1 1354665600 20 I usually like games like this one but I didn't like this one!  I tried but immediately deleted it sorry
A10BSKEV995JGL B00AVGGYNA 4 1368144000 20 I really like this game. Many ways to play. Enjoyable, easy, fun. All ages can have a good time playing.
A10BSKEV995JGL B00CWGWAEE 5 1369612800 22 This game was so interesting &amp; challenging. It kept my attention through the entire game. Good graphics added to this great game.

A10BW3585EEDR B006VXRNYG 5 1359936000 103 I downloaded this free app to my kindle fire and my younger grandchildren love it! If they are 'bored', I can turn on the kindle and load Kids Doodle and they are kept busy for at least an hour, which is great when you consider the 2 who play it most are 2 years old. Their favorite part of the app? Well, after you finish drawing a picture, you can click on the film reel at the bottom of the app and it plays back the drawing from start to finish. It always gets lots of giggles and claps from the wee ones.
A10BW3585EEDR B006DJ2JSI 5 1397692800 49 Simple interface. Keyboard pops up, type in the word and poof, there it is. I am taking a 'philosophy in justice' course and have come across some arcane words and the dictionary is quick and easy so I'm back to my studies in no time. BEST PART? IT'S FREE!
A10BW90I6MQW4N B008JGSM6G 5 1354665600 32 this is the best game ever I play this game all the time. I share this game with all my family. I told my mom and she cant stop playing this game

A10BZS2MHY2VIN B007D3BQY6 1 1350777600 21 They cycle through the same questions with no answers at all.  The user ends up coming with no conclusion and delirious.
A10BZS2MHY2VIN B005D9MUWY 5 1311206400 20 Im using the app right now to type this review.  The neon theme is my favorite and easy to use.
A10C3DEKCBOGE3 B00DREKMPO 1 1388880000 20 This software is for limited period only. After that we have been asked to buy it. The price is high.
A10C3DEKCBOGE3 B00APKDEH6 4 1401408000 21 Unlike any other free application it quite interesting. I get much from this application. Much helpful to know the happenings elsewhere.
A10C8XJVMBPBZA B00APKROYK 4 1373846400 22 I enjoyed most of the bundle of games.  Some were better than others.  If you love crosswords, this should be for you.
A10C8XJVMBPBZA B0085E2LFA 5 1373846400 21 Really fun to spot bonuses and strategize how to make your bubbles count. I enjoy this game several times a day.
A10C8XJVMBPBZA B0073LWEXK 2 1373846400 29 The graphics enticed me to purchase the game.  Once I began playing, it became very difficult.  There were too few clues and if you can't progress you lose interest.
A10C8XJVMBPBZA B00BJ7PY86 4 1373846400 20 The tiles seem bigger than other games and are easier to remove.  I would recommend this game to Mahjong buffs.
A10C8XJVMBPBZA B0055SWM08 4 1373846400 31 Each game is different and is more challenging than the one before.  Sometimes it takes more than once to complete the puzzle, but it is easy to reset and try again.
A10CAN2YCO8AXX B00E7VV2RS 5 1399161600 22 If u love clash of clans then this is your game. This is a very addicting game and I find it amazing.
A10CAN2YCO8AXX B00FATEJYE 4 1396224000 142 If your reading this your probably wondering if u should get this game. This game is cool and everything but It sometimes lags. For example your sometimes invisible. Sometimes u can't hit or block but that's rare. Also if u have a little bit of space in your phone, kindle, etc then it will be really laggy and it kicks u out of the game so if u don't have a lot of space don't get it. And also it takes so long to download and install. So yea that's pretty much it and im a go off topic. Do any of u nvm. So see u later peeps. Hah  fun playing injustice and hopefully it doesn't lag and sometimes it kicks u out and deletes the game by its self. That's only when u have a little space so bye peeps.
A10CAN2YCO8AXX B00DJFIMW6 5 1373587200 20 It's very fun for all ages it's entertaining, addictive game, when your bored you can always count on this game.
A10CBWYU39YWPW B00E5GJ7QS 5 1379203200 32 The game is fun to play. It isn't complicated and the levels and objectives are easily reached of course I just started playing lol but it's not bad for a free game.
A10CBWYU39YWPW B006HJKKCG 5 1364774400 20 This app is great it translates easily and with ease. Doesn't freeze or force close. I absolutely love this app!!!!!!!!
A10CBWYU39YWPW B00881VLCE 5 1361664000 26 this game is fun, and addictive. it challenges you. plenty of puzzles at varying difficulty. one of the best games on the market. absolutely love it.
A10CBWYU39YWPW B00CXBSYVG 5 1374537600 20 The game is fun a addictive, I haven't stopped playing since I downloaded it. I have to go now lol
A10CDWW8961C8Z B007PT3QOQ 5 1375574400 21 This app is very fun and addicting. Though this game uses up data, it is so worth it!!!! BEST APP EVER!!!!!
A10CDWW8961C8Z B00BNH1PF8 5 1371600000 22 This app is amazing! It is wonderful for all ages and can really make you think. Just as great as the first!
A10CDWW8961C8Z B00CB2837W 5 1375488000 29 This app is amazing! It is very addicting and you won't want to put your device down. In this app, it is also a lot easier to get boardwalk
A10CF0WS5TLRKV B009NF54ZE 1 1366761600 52 Why can't this be played on the kindle fire HD?  I love their games but most of them I can't get on my kindle and its frustrating!!  I would buy every single one.  Wish they would see this review (I'm sure they won't) and fix it where everyone could enjoy these games!!
A10CF0WS5TLRKV B00B0419YG 5 1361059200 39 I love all big fish games, I hate having to wait for the next one to come out!  This one did seem a little short but still great!!! No problems with downloading or viewing on my kindle fire hd!!!
A10CF0WS5TLRKV B008X8QCTO 5 1348876800 49 who cares if you had to pay 99&cent; after a hour into game it is a great game well worth it like always!  stop whinning if you cant afford the extra 99&cent; then stop playing it, unistall it, but dont give it a bad rating complain to the developer!

A10CF793FTE0KJ B00ANT4OHS 5 1388102400 38 I think this game is truly amazing. I love playing. The only problem is I got a new kindle fire HD for Christmas. It worked both in the 1st gen kindle fire and the newest kindle fire HE.
A10CF793FTE0KJ B008JK6W5K 5 1343865600 25 this is a really fun game! i cant even set it down. if you know alot of companies like nvidia then i sugest this app
A10CGSS98PNRFX B008N8IV2U 4 1344816000 47 I do have the cheats guide but when I do 9 x 9 = it does nothing .... I was really enjoying it up to this point.  I would try to figure out on my own and if I couldn't get it I would use the guide.
A10CGSS98PNRFX B008G0K9OS 4 1344988800 39 makes the time go by. but I don't like that if a zombie is on my far left or right of the soldier close up it is very difficult to get him to turn far enough to shoot it.
A10CGW13U7MQUE B00E6Z0THE 3 1387670400 24 I like this type of game but it does seem to be harder to see on a tablet.  It could be my eyes though
A10CGW13U7MQUE B00FEMJF6O 3 1387670400 26 I like this game and play it on Facebook but I find it hard to see on my tablet.  But then I am an older person.
A10CGW13U7MQUE B00EC5ZFL8 5 1387670400 20 I play this game on my tablet and online on Facebook and have no problem with it seeing each other.
A10CHQHOWTD3AC B009LT2LC6 5 1355097600 43 My 4 year old daughter loves building her terrarium as she scores prizes for correct answers.  I love that she is learning and thinks it is fun.  These Monkey Preschool Apps are great.  I bought them all and she likes all of them.
A10CHQHOWTD3AC B004DPC5Y2 5 1355097600 45 My 4 year old daughter loves this app.  It is cute ,and fun, and she is learning sight words, etc.  She is having fun and secretly learning, what could be better?  It runs well so I bought the additional Monkey Preschool Apps too.  Well done!
A10CHQHOWTD3AC B0064DBE9I 5 1357776000 56 We have had a lot of fun banging around on this piano keyboard app.  Even the baby likes it.  It is worth downloading for free.  My complaints are that the keyboard is too scarce to play a &#34;real&#34; song, and also the ads!  But if it is free, I don't really have much room to complain...
A10CHQHOWTD3AC B00636V5CM 5 1357776000 41 Everyone has read PEOPLE, I hope.  It is fascinating, always well-written, and a carefully crafted glimpse into the current American psyche.  It is very expensive, but I love weeklies and look forward to it every Friday.  This is a wonderful magazine.
A10CHQHOWTD3AC B00846I1Y4 5 1355788800 63 Funny app for young children.  My 4 year old thought it was hilarious and my baby was curious.  Kids can make animals play different songs, such as a frog croaking &#34;ba ba black sheep.&#34;  Kids can also play the keys themselves.  Keys light up to play along.  Very clever.  I can also see how this would get annoying to adults after a while...
A10CMHQCTPWNWK B00FZK2S5U 4 1391644800 20 This app teaches you how to draw fairy tale monsters well some of the monsters aren't how I imagined them
A10CMHQCTPWNWK B00F24OV8G 4 1380672000 21 This game is fun and gives you a challenge and I enjoy playing it and there pretty easy at the beginning
A10CMHQCTPWNWK B00HDRTGDK 3 1390867200 26 This game passes by the time when your bored and its challenging if you don't know what some of them but the game is really fun
A10CMHQCTPWNWK B00CRLSN4U 3 1383868800 28 This game is fun and sometimes gives you a challenge if you don't know the movie or remember it and it passes by the time if your bored
A10CMHQCTPWNWK B00H7WX7WM 4 1391644800 21 This app is awesome i finally find an app that teaches me how to draw anime which I've been looking for
A10COG3RFZFCQL B00913DPW2 5 1348704000 23 The title says it all. The only con is it is not zoomable so some of the writing is unreadable on a smartphone.
A10COG3RFZFCQL B006HN7UFW 4 1329609600 22 Lots of fun but  it often freezes on my HTC Sensation and loses my profile, making me start the game all over.
A10COG3RFZFCQL B0073LWEXK 5 1329264000 80 I loved Grisly Manor by the same outfit (Fire Maple Games) and had been looking for something similar. Then Lost City came out and I was pleasantly surprised to find it's  not only by the same people but vastly surpasses Grisly Manor in length and playability. It's not just a hidden object game but a true mystery puzzle game. to top it off, it is technically flawless on my HTC Sensation, a rarity with so many glitchy games out there.
A10COG3RFZFCQL B007MPJQ38 5 1338336000 37 Not as good as Lost City, but great nonetheless. Some of the puzzles can be practically unsolvable without a walkthrough,  but most were a lot of fun. I wish there were a lot more games like this.
A10CR8851PJN2V B008Y2FRFO 5 1359244800 50 I just started playing last night an I cant put it down just wish that we get  more coins faster. well again great game. thanks going to try to get my sister to play it. and my mom.ok I said more then 30 words so let me submit this please........
A10CR8851PJN2V B0097GVJWQ 5 1358294400 27 I played this game a lot would like more games like this one plz and this game said it was to continue when will that be plz
A10CR8851PJN2V B00B2TET3C 4 1362009600 27 good game I just wish I could win once in awhile .but in all in all its a good game when u have nothing else to do
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B00AJ1EWRM 4 1358640000 40 if your child is  into elfs then he/she will like this it is very simple and anything less then 5 years would use it for about two minutes. but for little ones will like the idea of trimming the tree
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B004EBZX6W 2 1404691200 19 WASTE OF TIME MOST OF US ALREADY HAVE ONE OF THESE IN  THE FORM OF BARS ON OUR ELECTRONICS
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B005V1N71W 5 1357689600 44 This is another application which has made my Kindle a better tool, then if it were not possible to load it. I have loaded it to my computers and been happy with it. Glad to be able to do the same with my kindle.
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B00BPWZKAM 3 1404691200 24 GRANDDAUGHTER PLAYS  ON MY KINDLE ALMOST EVERY TIME SHE VISITS.  THIS APP SHE INFREQUENTLY PLAYS WITH SHE IS 5, RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUNG ONES
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B005ZXWMUS 5 1357689600 51 I recently purchased a 8.9" Kindle. I have discovered that there are loads of apps which make the Kindle a much more complete tool. This is one of those apps, Recommend it especially if you already have a netflix account. Works just as well as it does on my TV,xbox ect.
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B0072KBY2Y 4 1397520000 25 I forgot I loaded this to my Kindle, but after using this a few times it has more then paid for itself. Recommend this app
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B007581DPQ 3 1404691200 26 GRANDDAUGHTER PLAYS  ON MY KINDLE ALMOST EVERY TIME SHE VISITS. SHE IS 5, SHE LIKED THIS ONE FOR A SHORT TIME  RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUNG ONES
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B00AXKPWSM 3 1358208000 31 Because of the way the camera is situated it makes this app hard to use to take someone's picture other then yourself . Do not recommend this app for the Kindle
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B00EYUCAV4 4 1404691200 25 GRANDDAUGHTER PLAYS THIS APP ON MY KINDLE ALMOST EVERY TIME SHE VISITS. SHE IS 5, RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOUNG ONES  SHE REALLY LIKES THIS ONE
A10CRW7XRJBJ2G B009ZZDNT6 1 1396656000 21 do loaded it twice can not find it in my cloud or my kindle hard to rate it sorry about that
A10CSKLJ7YSC2A B009C7ZQM4 5 1380844800 33 this app is fantastic I tried to download a game for my kindle fire and didn't. have enough. memory. this cleared a lot for me so I could down load it no problems

A10CSKLJ7YSC2A B004MC8CA2 5 1329696000 35 With today's hustle and bustle its often hard to remember what's most important God and his word! this app puts it at your finger tips. With reminders, and other options how could you go wrong!
A10CSKLJ7YSC2A B00C7X0ZNU 4 1376006400 25 this slot runs well not a fun bonus though u will win a lot when u win but thatis far between. fun though. good graphics
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B009HQ9UHC 4 1374278400 23 A twist on the bird games, not too bad, I liked the different ways to get to the next level, fun to play.
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B005LIYX5Y 2 1369785600 33 This is a free program so I guess I shouldn't complain but it wont change from screen to screen well and was difficult to play, I ended up removing it from my kindle.
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B004SJ3BCI 4 1374364800 22 LIke playing this game, it doesn't keep my busy for hours but a level or two is about right, then move on.
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B007N5YIUS 3 1374278400 21 It's just angry birds in space for a Kindly, fun to play but I wouldnt spend hours and hours on it.
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B004SJ3AXI 3 1374278400 25 Another birds game, fun for a while, wouldn't play it for hours at a time, but for a level or two it's a great distraction.
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B0064TVQ5E 4 1374278400 24 Love MahJong and now I can play it on my Kindle, this is a great game, has good features and lots of options, reccomended.
A10CTHRWD9P9IB B00BJQKQH6 3 1369785600 20 This is ok at first but is kind of boring after a while, not too bad for the price tho.
A10CYODHZSO9O7 B008L3T37O 1 1355702400 59 I couldn't tell you. Force closes when opening on EVO 4G. Any app that force closes should never be released. It must be reliable and compatible with the mass devices. Developers should do research and TEST, TEST, TEST! Very disappointed because I cherish all hidden object games. Thank you, Amazon, for FAOTD! If I had paid, I'd be infuriated.
A10CYODHZSO9O7 B004Z9Y3VY 3 1313625600 73 I dont know who was talking about 20 clicks to a nice ending. It was definitely waaaay more than 20 clicks. Perhaps more like a hundred, and after last one, it just loops you back to the beginning.I&apos;d have to say it was a bit corny. I&apos;ve seen something almost identical before. This version wasnt really different or unique. It certainly didnt move me enough to have good laughs like some other reviewers.
A10CZNMW67S3O0 B0091REZMW 3 1389225600 54 The game is extremely entertaining, the problem is the energy. You have to be willing to pay your way through the game or be willing to play 5 minutes every couple of hours, a full bar of energy is barely enough to do 3 searches. I usually play other games while the energy charges.
A10CZNMW67S3O0 B006OIK6JC 5 1390780800 43 I liked this app since I'm sending cards to a mobile with limited online access, I like that it can send as an attachment and not a link, also writing my own text  to the images and is very easy to use .
A10D3QXJUWMIRJ B006RAX9OQ 2 1325203200 58 From nexus s: force stopped during first install: retried and app was really, really slow at installing and opening (I understand a longer start up on first opening... but within reason, this took way too long): once game finally opened the graphics were choppy, frame rate too minimal and game play ultra simple. All in all... Not fun.
A10D3QXJUWMIRJ B0051HL5Q0 2 1327881600 23 This is a really boring game.  Uninstalled pretty quickly.  All you do is slide back and forth while the ship auto fires.  Blah.
A10D3QXJUWMIRJ B004U6KEH4 1 1326499200 36 Pretty pointless.  Unless you like putting thumb tacks in a wall.  Then maybe it's for you.  Random touches on the screen redirect your device from game play to advertising.  Not fun, not exciting, not funny... Uninstalled.
A10D3QXJUWMIRJ B006ON41FC 5 1329696000 37 I'm impressed.  This is a cute game that's fun to play.  It's challenging but not impossible, has a good series of goals to achieve, and the controls respond well to input.  Totally great on the nexus s.
A10D3QXJUWMIRJ B004Z9Y3VY 1 1314403200 22 The problem with this application is that it is exactly what you expect it to be... Dumb.  Uninstalled after like 2 minutes.
A10DBMU23KRTPI B00B2TET3C 5 1361664000 24 love the game. its the best bongo app I have found so far. no problems logging in to facebook and hours of fun play
A10DBMU23KRTPI B008YOBYNG 5 1351382400 21 I love slots games and this one has quickly became one of my favorites. easy to understand and hours of fun
A10DBMU23KRTPI B008D2QRAO 5 1342224000 24 have this game on my ipod and I was excited to see it for my kindle. Hours of entertainment. My kids love it too
A10DBMU23KRTPI B0067Q4RCI 4 1326931200 20 very nice graphics and game play had a lot of fun playing it. much better than other games I've tried
A10DBMU23KRTPI B0091REZMW 4 1351296000 38 the game is easy yet challenging at the same time.  Love all the quests. Definetly a game I would play over n over again. only problem is the special codes wont work on my kindle fire. that's aggravating
A10DBMU23KRTPI B00EBQRSTK 4 1377216000 31 very easy to learn n hard to put down. Some levels r more challenging than others but it helps keeps the game interesting. A definite must have for all fire owners.
A10DH6UX1MS6GV B00HGJ18C2 3 1404259200 45 Not the kind of solitaire that I am used to playing but it does provide me with down times in the evenings.  Still searching for the other kind and someday I will find it.  Wish this game had choices as to what we could play.
A10DH6UX1MS6GV B00IS87HYI 3 1402876800 51 Wish there were more than 5 lives at a time and that if you are playing off line, then you could keep on playing instead of waiting to get other parties or such to go to the next level.  Other than that, I enjoy the game for some quiet down times
A10DH6UX1MS6GV B00D948SS0 2 1404259200 5 no challenge in this one.
A10DHZUQKLY273 B008RA3X5E 5 1363824000 20 I like the different clock views and sounds. I love having the weather and temperature advisable when I wake up.
A10DHZUQKLY273 B008TQ16OG 4 1363824000 22 My five year old son loves it. I requires good hand eye coordination. Good sound effect. Different level options as you win.
A10DHZUQKLY273 B00A04F8NU 4 1363824000 20 This games has different options for difficulty. Any one age 3 and up would be able yo play this. Love!
A10DHZUQKLY273 B0073G5PU4 5 1363824000 24 This application is very simple and easy to use. I needed sort of a memo pad / calender to write quick notes to myself.
A10DJ2OVFWIJFX B004SYIA1U 5 1312934400 80 This app is awesome. While I wish I could cache the files for seemless playback even in low- and no-signal areas, that is merely a mild annoyance. The available selection is great, the sound quality as good as you&apos;ll get for the source material, and the interface pretty intuitive.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that playback doesn&apos;t pause on my phone when the headphone cable gets unplugged like on Slacker. Not enough of a gripe to pull a star, though!
A10DJ2OVFWIJFX B007IUKQGS 1 1339113600 92 The title sums it up. Really. I mean, at least at the DMV there might be a cartoon on the wall that amuses. This &quot;game&quot; is about as fun as a four finger prostate exam after a heavy Mexican dinner. The premise, while interesting and promising fails due to poor keyboard response, a total lack of incentive for the player, a near-criminal price tag considering the fun level, and the restrictive time and guess limits merely aggravate an already frustrating experience. This... application merely illustrates how not to make a game fun.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00DUGCLY4 4 1377993600 29 So  far I like this app. It's pretty easy, as long as you know what certain symbols mean. Whenever  you get stuck though, the hints are a great help.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00DLJ31HQ 5 1373241600 30 I haven't had this app for long, but so far, it has has been a really fun game to play. It is not only fun, but brain teasing as well.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00A0YXZVW 5 1353801600 27 I absolutly love this app. In my opinion, it is very addicting, but fun at the same time! I would recommend this app for anyone and everyone!
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00E78QIDE 3 1377993600 32 I like this app, but it is really hard to solve. I usually end up googling most of the answers. The answers make sense, but I would have never thought of them.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00BG3ID0Y 4 1365120000 22 I just bought this app, and I already love it. The puzzles are moderate, so you can't really get stumped too much.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00BX736EG 4 1365465600 36 The game is pretty good. I've played a bunch of different versions, and so far this is one of the best ones. The levels aren't very hard, and you can skip it if you get stuck.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00CRLSN4U 5 1372464000 31 I have only had this app for a short amount of time, but it is now one of my favorite apps! It is brain teasing but it is still really fun!
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00BPC23XO 3 1365379200 33 This is a pretty good game. So far I have nothing to say against this game. It even gives you the option of skipping the level, so you're not stumped for too long.
A10DLXN0N58BG6 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392422400 27 Just as good as flappy bird. I'm really only rating this to get all the bird colors. Now I'm just writing words to fill in this space.
A10DM50J4D43AM B00CTQ6SIG 5 1381017600 40 it is true. You will ruin your life with this game. You will tap your town and ignore your family and friends. Hopefully they also play and won't notice. Do not play at work, unless you need to look busy.
A10DM50J4D43AM B008MEM24S 5 1342828800 42 if you have &quot;where's my water &quot; then you can add this game into your existing app instead of installing this too. vice versa, swampy levels are available in this app. save 30 MB for something else.i like perry more than swampy
A10DM50J4D43AM B007MPJQ38 4 1338681600 35 i played with my 7 yr old daughter. now that we finished, she can run thru the whole mystery in about 30 minutes!  we got it as faotd. would pay for another set of chapters.
A10DM50J4D43AM B007XKEY6Q 3 1336176000 54 on kindle fire i do not see a way to delete a game i started with some who has the same uid as my sibling. word list had started to loop at about 80 turns and has way to many celebrity names. who can draw tupac? jimmy kimmel?hmmm, will the paid version be better?
A10DM50J4D43AM B007HBA70S 4 1339891200 35 the jewel games take tooooo long, very frustrating. i did not upgrade buildings but now i wish i had since it makes the ratio 1:1.  i will never play again now that i am done!
A10DOAZZKF2O5Q B00BMR4RIG 3 1381449600 38 There are other apps they do the same thing for free but at least this isn't bombing me with ads.  Location doesn't always change or pick up the correct city but I know the temperature and basic weather.
A10DT8Z5OA8U01 B0064X7B4A 4 1357430400 40 This a a free, fun app--I enjoy playing with both friends and anonymous players.  The only feature I do not like is the default to another screen for advertising whenever a play is submitted--perhaps that is the &#34;cost&#34; of free.
A10DT8Z5OA8U01 B004LOMB2Q 5 1357430400 22 I bought this app for my Kindle Fire--it works very well, is easy to use and I am happy with its features.
A10DTEC3NARLAK B007VUA7VO 4 1369440000 26 this app is a great monitoring tool for my Kindle Fire battery.  I suggest it to anyone who is looking around for this type of app.
A10DTEC3NARLAK B004HXHVZ8 5 1369008000 24 Love this app!  Looking at moving all my movies here. This whole setup is just really a cool deal.  Everyone should get this app.
A10DTEC3NARLAK B008FRG6JO 5 1347753600 27 I use this app quite a bit.  Its pretty much the only way I order piazza now.  It is a must have app if you love piazza!
A10DWTBXCHNF51 B008B88LEU 5 1357516800 41 If you are time poor DO NOT download this. I have so little free time , and yet I find time squeeze this in everyday. SpryFox is also fantastic at updating this app. Iknkow you will enjoy your time with this.
A10DWTBXCHNF51 B004FRX0MY 5 1360454400 53 I listen to all my friends with Iphones complain about the trouble of moving music and such. I can't sympathize with them. The ease of Amazon MP3 is great. I even uploaded my music to my cloud. I can listen to it anywhere.IT IS AWESOME....DownLOAD it now...why are you still reading this..go download.
A10DZV0FS8ECPR B00B7Y0206 5 1379894400 21 THE PICTURE IS CLEAN AND CRISP MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE ACTUALLY THERE IN THE VIDEOS. CANNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
A10DZV0FS8ECPR B00A4EZ3QS 5 1366329600 26 A different experience from the usual collapse games played where you go diagonal across zigzag etc, which will keep you looking to make a high score.
A10DZV85LYP38Q B00CPOT3ZM 1 1369267200 37 Don't get this app because I got looking at the reviews but u can only do two people unless u pay like 6 dollars I deleted this as soon as I got it not worth any time
A10DZV85LYP38Q B00F2UZ2UQ 5 1379116800 22 I loved this app I thought it would stink but it doesn't it rocks I think that every one should get it
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00E0NVX4U 5 1385510400 123 You will love this app. If you love a variety of fun puzzle games. I got hooked right away! I was playing my little heart out, when all of a sudden it said the free app was over (you only get so many levels before this happens). I had to buy the open full app, I was already hooked. It only cost $1.99 and I feel it was so worth it. This game reminded me so much of the Big City adventure games. Of course that one is not by Big Fish. However they are so very close. Go ahead try the free version first, because everyone has their own game preferences. However I think 99.9% of you will open the full version.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B007KPOZK4 2 1368144000 28 too much back and forth on the screens get confused where you need to be next. I lost interest after only playing it for an hour or so.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B009HKL4B8 5 1382400000 37 It takes time like a lot of other games to succeed in tasks. But I really like it as a free game, it is worth playing. I do recommend this to anyone who like the Sims games.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B006PH7WBM 5 1373673600 26 It takes time to build your store, but it is fun to play. This game will collect money while you are away, which I love that!
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B006OCM0G0 5 1382400000 28 Another Team Lava game I just love. The more players you get to join you as your neighbors the better. For tips and gifts. I recommend this app.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00ANH526W 4 1368144000 142 It keeps you busy with the goals and plus trying to get the education for each of your class mates. Since I added this game to my Kindle fire HD I have not had any problems with it freezing up on me like it did my other tablet(visual land). Visual land is a cheaper tablet and like the story goes you get what you pay for. So if you have a Kindle fire this app is for you. So fun. I am changing my update from 5 stars to 4 stars because once you get 23 recruits your basically done with the game. It states updates are coming however I have waited almost 6months for this to happen and I can't get any response from the maker on when there will be updates. So I guess I am done with the game.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B006OCM13M 5 1380672000 59 I had restaurant story loved it!! Out of the blue it kept stating I did not have wifi connection(which I did). So I uninstalled the game and tried to re install it and not it will not install??????????? Problem for Team Lava. So I found this one it is basically the same. So I do recommend it to all.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B0091REZMW 1 1373673600 21 you have to connect with friends on facebook to play this game. so i deleted it. I don't like that idea.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B008OOYALE 3 1373673600 26 Just did not really interest me at all. I got really bored with it after a few days so I just deleted it from my tablet.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00IS87HYI 5 1403827200 25 So much fun. A must have for you if you like candy crush. Finally available for kindle fire hd. Get it today and try it.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B008H4MVRG 2 1371859200 24 I lost interest in this one. The graphics were not that good and it just was not what I look for in a game.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B005ZXWMUS 5 1374796800 25 I love the idea that I can take my NETFLIX  anywhere with me on my tablet. I love the fact that Amazon offered this app!
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00F3W1GAS 2 1385424000 27 does not fit screen and time limit is to fast for tiny images I did not like this app so I will delete it from my kindle
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00AEJM6H2 3 1368144000 30 it is so like so many of the other games I got bored with it and deleted it from my tablet, no since have extra stuff I do not need.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B0050KDTSK 5 1388880000 28 I just love the great games Team Lava has for customers who love FREE games. I recommend this game to all of you have enjoyed their other games.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B007HIM53I 2 1374883200 46 I downloaded the game and started playing it. The thing that got on my nerves is that you have to keep going back and adding the music. The most time frame for this is one hour. This made me lose interest in the game right away.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00998UF9U 4 1373587200 21 It takes a while to do things energy runs out quickly. I just check on it periodically. Fun for the time.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00A9NXGAO 5 1401235200 43 I love the game. However get people's codes for friends off of this site. You will notice a lot of people have left their codes for that purpose. Because there is no wall where you can give out your code message to anyone.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B004SIIBGU 5 1371859200 32 I just love this app. It is the official eBay app for your android. I buy and sell on eBay. This app was perfect for checking on my site from my tablet.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B004SBS8LA 3 1371859200 38 This app was okay. Just another link to the original angry bird game. I personally, just do not get into the game. However, I know others who really like it. This would be a trial experience for individuals.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B005V1N71W 5 1383436800 30 I love being able to take my Pandora anywhere with me as long as I have my Wifi with me of course. I recommend this app to every music lover.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B007HQKSOS 5 1368144000 24 This is a fun game. You have to be patient because it is on real time status. But very fun and challenging to play.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00CTN0ALA 5 1373673600 65 This is an awesome game. It is so addicting. I play it all the time. Add friends when they request, they will send you free chips and you return them. You are only allowed 100 friends, which is pretty awesome.  Don't forget to sign in everyday for free chips every 24 days in a calendar month. Plus daily free spin for free chips as well.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B004UID2LC 2 1371859200 31 this app is not the correct download for your android. You need to download the you tube android app itself. This app does not give you search engines that you need.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00CZDSK7K 3 1371859200 28 Remember it takes time to do things on this game. However it is a fun game. Just check on it at least twice a day to accomplish task.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B005HSL626 5 1371859200 22 I think everyone enjoys this game. It is perfect to pass time when waiting in the doctors office. Perfect for all ages.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B004GVYXTS 3 1368144000 20 she liked it. she plays it every now and then.it is not as interesting to her as other games are.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00BL0I7WG 5 1371859200 24 Very fun hide and seek game. I do recommend this one to all android users. Being free app makes it that much more appealing.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B0094BB4TW 5 1382832000 25 love this app perfect for my kindle fire. I recommend this app to all of my Facebook friends who have any android tablet or phone.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00CWY76CC 1 1385424000 31 was able to just do 1st level then would not go any further deleted it from my device good thing this app was free or I would have been really upset
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B0060FHM3C 4 1371859200 26 This is a fun time lapse game. I usually check in on it at least 2 times a day. Fun way to build your own zoo.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00AFCEIB0 1 1383436800 35 Not the correct app for my Kindle fire HD. you can get to the google app through your app silk browser on by clicking on web. It will bring up other popular apps as well
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00B2V66VS 2 1371859200 33 I just lost interest in this game. It depends on the individual on this one. Some may just like. I just lost interest and did not need extra memory filling up my tablet.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00AHNC0SK 5 1403222400 28 Another great ea game. Takes awhile to get super tickets but other than that I am still giving it 5 Stars super tickets are given when level up.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00846WWVM 1 1363392000 21 did not like this game at all, did not make any sense on how to play it so i deleted it
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B008K3OOJM 5 1397001600 21 Perfect game for little ones. My granddaughter just loves it. I recommend this game to anyone's little one. Perfect for them.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00FAPF5U0 5 1385942400 27 GREAT APP FOR WAITING IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE OR JUST TO HAVE SOMETHING TO DO FOR THE MOMENT. SOME LEVELS SEEM HARDER THAN OTHERS BUT STILL FUN APP.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B008V06NRU 5 1390521600 65 My daughter and granddaughter just love this app. They are always playing it on my Kindle Fire H D. This app comes along with a variety of other games as well, for which you earn points (money) to spend on your Pou. You have to take care of your Pou in all aspects.  So cute, I would recommend this free and friendly game to anyone.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B007HGMVIE 5 1382400000 29 I love this game! It is so fun, like others from Team Lava you use your storm 8 ID to connect with other players. I do recommend this game.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00A9JG6RS 3 1368144000 21 boring just like other games got bored with it quick and deleted it from my tablet. maybe for the little kids
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00CTQ6SIG 5 1403222400 20 Great ea game. Recommend to everyone. Fun game if you are familiar to the show you will love it also.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00IZLM8MY 5 1402012800 20 My granddaughter loves this game. Perfect for your little one to play. I recommend it to all. Get it now.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00IIY2DP0 1 1393804800 62 I noticed the characters on this so called game is from the campus life game. You just read the episode and wait 4 hours in between. I guess I will read all of the episodes there are 2 stories. One has like 50 episodes and the other one has about 105 episodes. Just something to pass about 5 minutes of your time.
A10E0SPFC7DXIU B00BGC5UAG 3 1368144000 23 bored easy same as granny game. so I lost interest and deleted it from my tablet. you just need one game like this
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B00EWK8N8A 2 1399593600 22 Didn't really like this game much.  It was okay but wasn't really my type of game.  Grandkids didn't like it much either.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B0063IH60K 5 1336694400 20 Love this game. I play it lots. Will be playing it lots more. Keep giving us good games like this.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B004RCHGRC 2 1399593600 20 Didn't like this game much.  Couldn't really figure out how to play it so I took it off my Kindle.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B00B2V66VS 3 1362960000 20 Kind of not my type of game.  Hard for me to play.  I like matching games, word games etc better.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B00F8H0LM2 4 1381708800 21 Grandkids love it.  I have no idea since I have not tried to play it.  It isn't my kind of game.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B00D948SS0 3 1381708800 22 Fun game but hard to see it on my phone.  Too many words for me but I still try to play it.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B006M4F67A 4 1399593600 25 It is fun and I like it lots.  Wish it were on my Kindle too. Don't like having to add more words to this review.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B007XKEY6Q 2 1336608000 38 Can't get app to work.  Seems to have gone to a different language - Ingia - and I can't get it back to English.  Could be operator error also.  Any suggestions on how to correct this problem?  Thanks.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B007IIZVLA 3 1381708800 26 Have been trying to use it but have had some difficulty figuring it out.  Need to try it again and see if I can work it.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B0063GORYU 5 1338249600 26 Excellent game. I love playing it. Great graphics. I play lots of games and this is one of my most favorite ones. Ivan play for hours.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B007USZX7U 4 1381708800 21 Fun game.  I'm not very good at it but really enjoy playing it and waste much time trying to conquer it.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B009LT1YZ6 2 1363737600 33 Can't figure out this game.  Hate when I get these games and no instructions plus I'm not a youngster anymore and need more help playing these games so my grandson can play them.
A10E0TT0Y15LEG B00B7PKAKC 4 1392249600 20 Grandkids like playing this.  Good game for them to play and keep them entertained for awhile while I am busy.
A10E2KO1WJO22R B0096DFBZQ 2 1360281600 21 the graphics could be improved and this game is just a plain copy of the mario Kart games series of Nintendo
A10E2KO1WJO22R B00A42SC5E 5 1360281600 20 i would recommend this game to those who like temple run and subway surfers do to the intense addicting action
A10E2KO1WJO22R B00AAIHGA4 5 1360281600 20 i would recommend this to those who remember the classic days of sonic and his genesis adventures with his friends.
A10E2KO1WJO22R B00ANT4OHS 5 1360281600 20 lots of boosts upgrades, cars, and achievements that can be a worthwhile experience for app store gamers on the kindle
A10E2KO1WJO22R B009UX2YAC 5 1360281600 20 this game plays just like temple run with improve graphics, update, and controls and also has a fun multiplayer section
A10E2KO1WJO22R B007F1SLC6 1 1360281600 20 the game is too much data and would take to much space of the kindle and should not be downloaded
A10E2KO1WJO22R B00B2V66VS 5 1360281600 20 better graphics, new course, and the ability to respawn with the green jewel makes this game a very fun one
A10E2KO1WJO22R B00AKFBURC 5 1360281600 21 a lot like subway surfers and shows what is like to be and angry gran on the run from the city
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B00CWY76CC 4 1372982400 25 I had fun with this game. got stuck a couple of times but I figured it out. I can't wait to see the new rooms.
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B0089ZM1GY 4 1341446400 54 Just got this game and my grandson and myself have injoyed figuring out how to release the butterfly. I will play the game untill we have to buy something. I try not to do that ever. Free should be free. We will have fun with it untill then deleat it and try something else
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B008OOYALE 5 1351728000 22 Like Bing able to go in check on dragons, plant some food,  visit a friend and get out without spending the day
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B007ZGO7EM 5 1362528000 34 This is the best app ever for a calculator! It works great and is simple to use. I just love it it's. Just what I needed plain and simple and gets the job done.
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B008YRVW0I 2 1356048000 42 If your putting out a demo call it a demo! My grandson really enjoyed playing but we will not be sucked into buying a game that was to be free! Might have been different if we were told that from the beginning
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B00ARRDTX6 4 1366761600 21 Two year old grandson can't wait to play it every morning. Not as cute as I had hoped it would be.
A10E6T1WNNVNWK B007SYWFRM 1 1334534400 32 loaded this twice and both times it checked for updates and said I was not connected to the web. I was looking forward to playing but could never get past that point
A10E86TFEM64HV B007FVIX4C 5 1357862400 21 It is a fun way to trick people into actually thinking you are on the phone. It is really fun too.
A10E86TFEM64HV B004SRPXWQ 3 1360454400 26 This app is ok. Sometimes it is funny and other times it is super annoying. I would recommend this app to people who have little kids
A10E86TFEM64HV B004TSAPIQ 3 1360454400 21 This app is alright. All u get to do is draw! Sometimes I do it when I am very very bored
A10E945KKQYYPD B004HGK6FW 5 1327536000 31 this is a very fun and easy app. I never really understood regular sudoku and now if you make a mistake it tells you. plus it works well on kindle fire.:-)
A10E945KKQYYPD B004QJKRZ4 5 1326585600 41 some people like things like this but I don't since it made purple gloop shoot out of my butt at my brother and he died and I got in big trouble. its not my fault I'm filled of purple gloop :-(
A10E945KKQYYPD B004N2NWT2 1 1326585600 55 first of all it called me a Moron.  and who wants an app that does that. on my second try it made me puke all over my kindle and I threw it at the poster of this game and I had to get a new kindle fire and a new poster of a different game.
A10E945KKQYYPD B0054JZC6E 5 1326585600 22 You should totally buy this app. it is so fun but you'll never really finish it.  there is so many fun games.
A10E945KKQYYPD B00846GKTW 5 1346457600 20 this game is real fun. its a lot better than it girl or top girl. you should really get it.
A10EBW1KB7CXAE B006OC2ANS 5 1332288000 20 this app,is very fun I hope there is a sequal because it is so fun fun fun fun fun fun
A10EBW1KB7CXAE B0067Q42BY 3 1329609600 25 this is a great game but it has ads and every five minutes it says please rate this game and is too easy to win
A10EBW1KB7CXAE B0070O973K 1 1330214400 62 this is a game without a clever story line or a main menu all you do in this game is rub your finger on your phone or in my case on my kindle fire this game is a time waster for people with no life its not exciting or cute, well its cuter then the average poo and its not that fun.
A10EBW1KB7CXAE B006ON41FC 5 1329436800 35 this game is a simple, cleaver, and funny twist on the life of a flying squirrel. if you need to kill some time or are just bored then this stress relieving game is for you.
A10EBW1KB7CXAE B004JZBGWI 5 1331769600 22 I love this app it comes in handy with a calender and anything you have planned for today will be.in.you notifycation bar
A10EBW1KB7CXAE B006OCM13M 1 1330732800 20 I got this app, played for ten minutes then I unistalled it it has bad graphics and has no point
A10EHB350ZWG4V B006E51AZY 4 1330041600 23 I thought the game was very fun I wish the free version was longer though because I finished it in a half hour!
A10EHB350ZWG4V B0087TQYUG 5 1341532800 41 I bought this game because I play words with friends. I thought the game wasn't going to be fun but I love it!! I think its even better than words with friends. scramble is a must have and its free :)
A10EHB350ZWG4V B00DYY92MG 4 1392076800 22 Guess the tv show...fun! Had a hard time trying to figure out some of the shows, but still a lot of fun.
A10EJLXMM3GTL6 B00A4KVFLY 4 1354924800 33 its fun to be able to play as well as help your facebook friends... my only complaint is my kindle is slow to type so I don't always finish my rounds in time

A10EJLXMM3GTL6 B007SYDYLS 4 1340496000 21 if theres nothing to do it helps pass the time ... more animations are needed or something ... missin the extras
A10EJLXMM3GTL6 B008N02WZU 5 1357603200 34 this game is entertaining when bored and is somewhat difficult which makes it even better.  would recommend to all.If you do decide to download this game you wont be sorry believe me :).enjoy amigos
A10EJLXMM3GTL6 B00846GKTW 5 1337990400 29 alot of fun especailly for girls who love fashion and are creative (: very enjoyable!  they give you different models and different hemes that make the game non bland
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B004UNX1LS 3 1385856000 56 Vevo is wonderful and trusty on computers, but there was a glitch when I tried to play it on my Kindle Fire. I don't know if it's just my 1st Generation Kindle Fire being too old or the app but for me it did not work. I still use Vevo on my TV and computer, though!
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B005X9498M 3 1376438400 36 This is a nice prank, but it would be better if all of the apps on the screen would open my real apps. It make my Kindle look like an iPad Mini, and is rather convincing.
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B00DEG4Z1W 3 1385856000 50 It was very realistic and seemed to amuse my 9 year old cousin but for me it wasn't that exhilirating and plus you had to buy fancy hairdos so as soon as she left two hours later I deleted it and she didn't miss when she came back another time.
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B007ZE34FM 4 1385856000 98 The best music downloader ever! I have all of my favorite songs for free, I can test the songs for voice editing or flaws, and I can play the songs I downloaded without Wi-Fi! (Listening to &quot;Diamonds&quot; by Rihanna on Music Download as I write this!) What keeps it from be a 5-star app is that you have to press save multiple times before it actually downloads and also sometimes it takes forever to process so that you can listen to it first. But other than that, this app is AMAZING! Good job and thank you, Temel Bilgisayar!@
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B00992CF6W 5 1371859200 59 I am obsessed with this app... when I play it on my iPod. $7 is really expensive for a simple game. Fun for my iPod since you can get the free version. I wish they would get the Lite for Kindle Fire. Otherwise the best game ever, thanks for inventing it !^&infin; (Exclamation mark to the power of infinity)
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B00FAPF5U0 3 1385856000 101 I finally got sick of the Candy Crush Saga ads so I decided to download this game. It was really fun and addicting at first but then right in the middle of my fun, the app said that I had to wait twenty or thirty minutes for new lives or else I would have to buy them. I NEVER buy apps or in-app purchases and only get things when they're free, so naturally I deleted the game. I have zero patience when comes to over 2 minutes of waiting. I'm glad I deleted it. Overall, it was fun for thirty minutes.
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B00B7Y0206 1 1371859200 58 I was looking forward to actually downloading videos instead of using Wi-Fi since I'm going on the plane. After several attempts at downloading it onto my Kindle Fire, I gave up. Each time it said, &quot;Cannot be installed.&quot; Probably has potential but I'll never know. Hope it works for everyone else and that you don't encounter this issue!
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B009UX2YAC 4 1385856000 62 I got this app and was thrilled at first. I played it 24/7 back when it was very, very popular. I had for about a year but after not playing for 4 months I decided that it was wasting space so I deleted it. It was really awesome at first, though, so if you like action games then this is for you!
A10EM7KXU5R9CY B009C7ZQM4 5 1386288000 80 The best app ever! This app is really easy to use and gives you guidance on what everything is. If you are wondering what something is then there's a FAQ button and you kill running apps to boost your memory! I have already cleared out a total of 1.3 GB after two weeks of owning this! I didn't. know that my Kindle was being thrashed by so many residual and cache files. I check it every day. GET THIS APP!
A10EN7TT3SKSBL B00A3E38E8 5 1356220800 22 Love this game... Its awesome! would recommend to all ages from Teens to 100 all kinds of great  music to choose from!
A10EN7TT3SKSBL B007URBVA4 5 1352332800 32 I tend to be easy to please.  I love earning coins to buy new levels and balls.  It's one of my favorite games Once you get started its hard to put down.
A10EN7TT3SKSBL B0094BB4TW 5 1356220800 23 This is a very easy app. All the kids love it and I do too.  I have reconnected with all the old friends....
A10EOCQIYSMI6Y B00913DPW2 5 1351814400 82 This is a very enjoyable point and click adventure game. great puzzles, almost all of which can be solved without cheating. features an innovative hint system where you collect hidden moths which can be exchanged for one clue per puzzle. if that isn't enough there is a link to the walk through and even a skip puzzle button! i used it to avoid a sliding tile puzzle which i hate. the walk through has too many spoilers, try not to use it.
A10EOCQIYSMI6Y B0085P2Z6E 4 1355875200 75 I enjoyed my time with this little game. I could pinch and zoom just fine on my little Samsung smartphone. classic hidden object gameplay with added challenges like flashlight, memory and jigsaw puzzles. The static character portraits between stages got boring and i was expecting a twist or surprise during the very linear story. Also the same objects were in every room. On the whole it was well done and left me hungry for more!
A10EOCQIYSMI6Y B009RLG7RI 4 1362960000 41 I liked the concept and gameplay of this match 3 puzzler. The town building between levels was intriguing. However it was too hard to play on my little Samsung phone. Much better suited to a tablet so your eyes don't hurt!
A10EOCQIYSMI6Y B0085YNML2 5 1362960000 25 This adorable game is worth much more than a buck! Puzzles are challenging but can be perfected with practice. Bright colors and good sound too.
A10EQTO7RQ3R72 B00CHSPB8Y 5 1373932800 32 This game is awesome but I think you should be able to do something other than the flying part other than that it's an awesome game I think you should get it
A10F2EQWPB165 B0064X7B4A 5 1376438400 34 If you like scrabble, then you will love Words With Friends!  You can play with people you know or random people.  I play with both.  This game is challenging and can be competitive too.
A10F2EQWPB165 B00COVCV50 5 1371081600 30 This game is entertaining for all ages esp if you like word puzzle games. Good app to pass the time with and keeps you thinking.you will love this game too.
A10F2EQWPB165 B0053R08CU 5 1341792000 20 This app is very entertaining!  If you like puzzles then more than likely will enjoy this.  and bonus...it was free!
A10F38UBZB45R5 B004XWL0ZA 5 1322352000 23 I have twin 2yr olds and they love it and I love them using a tablet so well. Free is the best price!
A10F38UBZB45R5 B0054JZC6E 3 1326240000 30 some of the games are really fun others are not. some of the controls are confusing or don't work correctly but in the end its free so its worth it.
A10F3OX0ANZG2B B0087TQYUG 5 1354147200 20 I play this game with several of my friends from church and relatives.  Very challenging.  Great brain strengthening. Fun, too.
A10F3OX0ANZG2B B007PW1BZY 4 1354147200 23 This was much closer to the actual card game.  I play it fairly often.  It just depends on how much time I have.
A10F3OX0ANZG2B B007NZV2HK 3 1354147200 20 Not as good as some other word search games that I have.  Seems elementary compared some others I've seen. Ok
A10F3OX0ANZG2B B007PW1BRC 2 1354147200 25 Did not like that it chose what phase you would do, rather than the regular progression in the hand-held game or the original card game.
A10F4KQZY3JW8F B009YOX6XQ 2 1399075200 66 Even though I paid for this application, I haven't been able to add any of the books saved in my Kindle Fire on that book shelf.  It just doesn't work well and there are no instructions to show step by step how to do that.  Unfortunately, I will have to delete it, as it didn't comply with my expectations.  Plus it was a waste of money.
A10F4KQZY3JW8F B004LOMB2Q 4 1396310400 23 It provides the help to save some notes for later.  I will continue to have it as a nice feature for my Kindle.
A10F4KQZY3JW8F B0051UP5NQ 5 1396310400 23 It was easy to use and provides the necessary tools I needed to write documents or elaborate spread sheets as well as presentations.
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00E3WJRIM 4 1380067200 76 Fun free app I would given a five star but there just one little issue I had with the game. That is after its your turn its goes to an ad the flashes and I feel like i Gonna have a seizure. if they could change it that would be great otherwise I would have given it FIVE STARS go ahead and give it try if like wheel fortune game play with your friends and family
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00E9M3ILI 5 1378771200 41 It's a game that you have to be quick at the draw think three moves  ahead. But the in games boosts from the dots you ate. Some may say its boring but you just have to try it out for yourself
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00CTQ6SIG 5 1378771200 113 This game is fun if you have the patience to rebuilding it a little at a time. You get  to make Springfield your way and get characters as you move forward in the game.....Still looking for Bart But dont have a cow in the beginning he is around just have to keep building until you find him and this was a free game at  the time I am wrote this  so give  it a whirl and rebuild Springfield.Update: The Halloween trick n treat you, Springfield is overrun by ghosts collect the goo is fun the community aspect is great too but for only a limited time..7nov 2013 hurry to get in on it
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00F8H0LM2 5 1380067200 85 Great free app!!! Its so cute with all of the Star Wars characters and then to teleport the one you want ( need buy the telepods at Wal-Mart for 39.00 dollars but well worth the price) Very interactive Game and its free. Now you also buy the app for 0.99 cents I am sure there that this games would have more levels and other aspect of the movie(I have yet to buy the app) So I am just guessing what is different between the two.
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00FW0JOJQ 4 1385510400 190 This game is like temple run but more challenging to players.....you are in mine cart going thru different worlds you have to collect the golden nuggets and all jewels. I love playing the game but the draw back to this game is that they only give two of four or five worlds you have to buy all the others. you can buy stuff for the cart and boost but they are only for three runs. If you want it permanently you have to pay real money for it with in store buying. At first it was bit challenging to stay on track and jump but you have to get use to the controlsSo, BEWARE if you down loading for kids and you dont have in store purchasing blocked.I would have given this game a 5 star rating if there was more options to buy stuff with nugget like all the other worlds.I give an 1 rating for violence because you do fly off the rails but no blood thou.GIVE Us more worlds that we can buy with nuggets Then I will change my rating for this to a five star.CC
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00IZMQ8G0 4 1400198400 86 I love this trivia game race around the world and thru history.The only draw back is the way back machine always 20 refuel.  YOU CAN PLAY random people to get a free round once a day or you can pay .99 to gamble on getting more fuel. Honestly I wait...I come back every day and20 each day. I do this five  days and get 100 for the way back machine. THEN I PLAY FOR free round.it cost 20  to play. Then two rounds afterwards and repeat.
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00DJFIMW6 5 1378771200 54 Can I say about this game but its cute and fun trying to get you despicable points by hitting up your Minions. the course are the same format but with different themes.... I am still discovering things in the game you get to buy different clothes for your minion oh the fun never stops
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00F54F1G4 5 1387065600 45 Awesome game that is fun to run around and play it but only give you like 4levels before you have to put in the money for the full version but I think its well worth getting it.3 for violence but okay to let kids play
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00E5GJ7QS 5 1380931200 28 Cute little game, well worth playing  the caller is a fast pace caller but it keeps the game moving.  It's the BEST Bingo I have played on kindle.
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00B2TET3C 4 1364515200 44 This game is fun to play .Well as worth time to down load and space used on kindle.Oh don't forget. To feed your kitty for extra diamonds and don't forget to play the slot every day....Enjoy your BINGo play...see us ROUND THE BEACH FRONT
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B00D9CNAOY 4 1380067200 123 Its fun little game with bees that help your game play. The only thing that I did not like of this game it requires you to use your honey points for boosts even if dont want them you have to have one to play and you get very little for daily honey points so I can only play every three days or so(you can buy more but who can afford to do this not me) So I have to wait  but its well worth it. Give this cute little spelling game a try and maybe learn new words to spell. I would have given it five stars if it was not for being force to play with a boosts every time.Good luck gamingCC
A10F8KU66A2LBZ B007VCVCAM 5 1385510400 72 This was and is cute Game for fan's of the show..... Defend the refrigerator from the invading food  get a little help from your pals oldie and company Upgrade as you go and dont forget to replay stages to collect cookies and popcorn.This gets a rating of one for violence but nothing else is really bad about this game. I would and do let my 8 yr old son play this one.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B008L3T37O 2 1345680000 22 This game was really boring.  Uninstalled after just a few minutes.  It made no sense whatsoever. Grafics not good. Very slow play.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B00846FBEM 5 1339027200 23 Well worth the money. If you like hidden object games definitely buy this one. Great challenge. The best one I have found yet.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B0087HT36U 5 1349481600 24 Love this game. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the Age of Cowboys. Worked great on Acer tablet. Hurry.. for the next stage
A10FBCA2RGV549 B00DGXGNQ8 4 1373155200 23 So far so good. Enjoyed this game on regular computer. Nice to have it on my tablet. Good game to pass the time..
A10FBCA2RGV549 B006R8GK2Q 5 1340582400 22 I have liked all games from G5. If you like hidden object this one is really good. Nice clear pictures and colorful.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B008R9OIUO 5 1345680000 48 This is one of the best hidden object games I have found. And I've tried a lot. Enjoyed it so much I actually paid for full version and usually 99cents is my limit but this is we'll worth the$4.99. Take a chance if you love hidden object games...
A10FBCA2RGV549 B009T8XBBO 3 1368921600 26 kinda boring not my kind of game. To kid like. Prefer more thinking kind of games. Get only if it is free app of the day.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B00KGCNRAM 5 1403740800 31 This is one of the best Mahjong games I have found. Lots of different puzzles to solve. Try it and I am sure you will love it. Well worth 99 cents.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B0063GSL60 5 1344297600 26 Free cell is as good game to play to pas the time. Makes you think. If you like solitaire type games this is a good one.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B005SE8IFW 5 1341619200 21 What a fun app. Easy to use. Worth the money. It's fun to play with your pics and change the colors.
A10FBCA2RGV549 B004QQ7KV6 2 1330646400 33 Got this for my Acer A500 tab and it didn't have any interesting news on it. Most of what was there was old news. So I uninstalled it. Not worth taking up memory....
A10FBCA2RGV549 B00910Y1OQ 5 1352332800 21 Fun, challenging game. Works great on Asus tf300. Have it on my PC. Definitely worth the time and money. Recommend !
A10FBCA2RGV549 B0067Q4DPE 5 1325808000 27 Wow!! This is the best Majong game yet Definitely recommend! And it was free.  What more could you want?  Woks great on my Acer Iconia Tab.love it
A10FBCA2RGV549 B007D2XSW0 5 1340755200 37 So glad I got this app when it was free but having used it I would have paid. Love it. Works great on my Acer Tablet.If you like to mess with your pics definitely get this one.
A10FC5YJXMGHV6 B00FPISXPQ 5 1390089600 21 Lots of fun.  Many different photos to solve.  Not too hard and not too easy.  Just right for everyone.  Have  fun.
A10FEJNBVLJTLM B00BFUUMO8 1 1368921600 43 I was SO excited to see this app, but my expectations were not, to say the least, met. It refused to load past the intro screen. After waiting (and waiting some more) I ended up uninstalling it. Twice. Thank goodness it was free.
A10FEJNBVLJTLM B00CC59H8W 2 1367280000 46 I downloaded this one on the basis of the reviews, and uninstalled it just as fast. It hung up, I got annoying ads between levels trying to get me to buy game extras, and although the plot line is cute, the game play just wasn't fun.
A10FES2AU7AYTD B00AO5WLIU 2 1364169600 23 I really don't understand why there is an ad banner at the bottom of my screen. I'm glad I didn't pay for this.
A10FES2AU7AYTD B008JJM88Q 4 1370390400 29 So far he had it wrong once out of 8 times. He could not get Lenny from Memento. But he got everything else! Even from Japanese animes! How? SPOOKY!
A10FES2AU7AYTD B007TKT2SK 5 1369094400 53 Does exactly what it supposed to do. No mem button, but really does not bother me.The internet access is odd, I turned off my internet and it works fine. l'm pretty sure no one will be watching my calculations to advertise fractions to me.I needed this app when I was in high school!
A10FES2AU7AYTD B00CBJMYKM 1 1371859200 24 In the middle of the night I would get ad alerts for games to download. Discovered it was comming from this game....uninstalled right away!
A10FES2AU7AYTD B008IJT0CE 3 1369699200 36 This is a pretty solid app. The interface is really nice. But not much sounds. Overall I prefer Lightning Bug better... but my kid enjoys this because the inteface is so simple to use. fun stuff.
A10FHEBZMXRT3R B0051UP5NQ 1 1339545600 25 Costs extra for fonts and charges for updates. Be wary of apps that don't have clear costs. Developer needs to be more clear about prices.
A10FHEBZMXRT3R B006D1ONE4 4 1325289600 27 my six year old is on level 20. my four year old can't make it past 3. gets complicated fast with unrealistic do hickies. fun but hard.
A10FHEBZMXRT3R B009WO7NQO 1 1352851200 71 $2.99 for a game, and there's only two levels? My 7 year old son had this solved in 30 minutes. You want $1.99 more for the third level? Sorry, my son was disappointed when I told him no. No more Angry Birds purchases (games or merchandise) for our family until Rovio gets back on track. Sorry, but we don't do in-app purchases, and remove those stinking ads from a paid game.
A10FKZ7JOSFKRD B0081JPTXK 4 1401580800 28 If you like slots, Double Down Casino offers a wide variety of fun. I get the thrill of a casino without losing any money. Keep the games coming.
A10FKZ7JOSFKRD B00HYL0AAI 3 1396569600 26 Romance Slots are okay. Nice to pass the time, but average games. I prefer slots that have several levels to them. These don't have that quality.
A10FMQ18F5FKAM B006ON41FC 1 1331769600 41 This game is addictive and fun.  So why the one star?  Because I am reviewing this game against my will.  Every time I start the game I am prompted to rate it.  So I am now doing so, but under protest.
A10FMQ18F5FKAM B008194C74 5 1344384000 67 ...with a word game.  I don't consider myself very good at wordgames, but this title simultaneously makes me feel like I am good at this game and entertains me with some of the best and funniest quotes of all time.  Most games I've played have rewarded me with a &quot;good job&quot;.  This game rewards me with another great quote, making this title very hard to put down.
A10FO9BPP977EC B00FAPF5U0 5 1388275200 29 I was happy to finally see candy crush on the Kindle. I love it. It was definitely past due....I'm sure all you candy crush addicts feel the same way!
A10FO9BPP977EC B00AMR1HZ8 5 1402358400 26 This is a fun game to play. It is just like the real game without Vana White. Now I can play something other than candy crush.
A10FP2595BNO30 B008PFPKWU 5 1347667200 44 ...is by far the most addictive game! I have 5, 6 and 7 on my My Touch, and when I discovered it is available for my Kindle Fire is grabbed it immediately...I LOVE this game, the graphics are so intense....grab it...you'll like it :-)
A10FP2595BNO30 B00EQ0CKRQ 5 1378857600 22 Asphalt 8 is awesome! The graphics are beautiful and the layout is nice.  I am addicted to all of my Asphalt games!
A10FP2595BNO30 B00FAPF5U0 5 1387843200 26 .....only because it's an AWESOME game and I can't be like everyone else bragging about my levels ;-)I LOVE this game!  I LOVE this APP!enough said....
A10FPGETREYZEN B00CAK052Q 3 1368144000 21 Although there is a limited track the graphics are smooth and leveling up seems easy enough...I would like some racing competition...
A10FPGETREYZEN B00CLVW82O 4 1372291200 25 I really enjoyed the story line...maybe I'm having an off day because I needed the hint button quite a bit.  Graphics were great...all around winner...
A10FPGETREYZEN B0097EWK3A 5 1370822400 33 I am absolutely in love with these Big Fish games...and this one kept me on the edge of my seat...I loved the difficulty...the game flow....and the story...Get this game...you will not be sorry.
A10FPGETREYZEN B008VRQNIC 4 1359504000 25 I really enjoy the game thus far, but I find it very hard to keep the cash flow high enough to destroy the roaming creatures...
A10FPGETREYZEN B00CWGWAEE 5 1370649600 39 This is the most intriguing game I have ever played...I could write a book about what I love about this game....if it is not on your Kindle you are truly missing one of the best games on the market!
A10FPGETREYZEN B00DBER974 4 1376006400 41 The game is very well done...the games were not too hard but not too easy...but by the time you got closer to the end they were almost giving stuff away...otherwise it would have been a five star game...still liked the game...
A10FPGETREYZEN B00J4JZRQK 5 1396915200 22 G5 did a fantastic job with this game...different types of games that I've never seen anywhere else...even from G5...I am very impressed...
A10FPGETREYZEN B00A9JG6RS 5 1364256000 24 This is a very cute game to play...the graphics are amazing...the birds are adorable...and it's free...and who can pass up a wonderful free game...
A10FPGETREYZEN B00F0VLN2S 5 1401235200 24 I love the complexity of the game...it's not hard but it's not so easy that you fly through it and get no challenge...love it....
A10FPGETREYZEN B00I3D27CU 5 1392163200 20 I really enjoyed the game.  I love the HOG adventures and this did not disappoint.  It was worth every penny!
A10FPGETREYZEN B008YRVW0I 5 1360713600 25 I have always loved this game...the graphics are fantastic...the game play is easy to learn yet hard to master...and who doesn't love fish by golly?
A10FPGETREYZEN B00AIQP9DE 5 1373068800 37 I try my best to make these HOG' s last for awhile...but for insomniacs like me it was impossible to put down.  Very entertaining and not so hard that you will want to treat your hair out!
A10FPGETREYZEN B00IFXI4LQ 5 1394064000 23 This was so much fun, I couldn't stop paying unless I was asleep...the games are so different, it was just so much fun!
A10FPGETREYZEN B00AKJRPC2 5 1365379200 43 I have only had this game for 1 day and I am totally hooked...it is so much fun.  I enjoy the leisure time that, and that I don't have to wreck myself with time limits.  I am just super happy with my purchase.
A10FPGETREYZEN B00E5MN3DU 5 1379808000 24 Big fish has been doing so much better lately...I really hope you keep up the good work...puzzles made you think and that was great!
A10FPGETREYZEN B00BWBHIUG 5 1371427200 38 I have always liked fish games...but this is one of the better ones.  The educational side is awesome as are the graphics and music.  I know it is more geared toward children but really enjoy Nemo' s Reef!
A10FPQBP4C1Q3A B005VTS4EY 5 1331337600 26 I really like this little physics puzzle game.  only 100 levels, but it will give you a hour or two of game play.  I recommend it.
A10FPQBP4C1Q3A B004N8KDNY 4 1329004800 22 its like pvz sure, but its balanced differently.  it was fun enough for a half hour to be a deal for $1
A10FPQBP4C1Q3A B004O4K4SQ 5 1330732800 21 I didn't expect much but I was very surprised.  it is really fun.  the weapon leveling and variation makes replay enjoyable.
A10FRC0MXT5V7B B00BPC23XO 4 1368576000 22 Pretty entertaining. One of the better free games I've played in this genre.  Hey it's free to boot. Give it a try.
A10FRC0MXT5V7B B008JJS6D2 5 1362787200 24 Great game. Only issue is slow credit regeneration. Otherwise I've had no issues. This is my way of relaxing and unwinding after along day.
A10FRC0MXT5V7B B00D1DL0IE 4 1372204800 22 Fun. Passes time. Kinda repetitive based on other logo games. Not just an easy zip through game and it makes you think.
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B006D1ONE4 4 1346630400 22 Good game, I would recommend out to anyone who likes puzzle games gets kind of addicting so be careful and have fun
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B00CWY76CC 4 1371600000 38 it was fun but kind of difficult! takes lots of memory and i had to look up some help to figure a few out! there is one problem which is that there are only 10 levels available currently!
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B00ANT4OHS 4 1360368000 29 really good waste of time. tried late at night and really enjoyed this game. very addictive. you try if you like mindless fun just try it already very fun..
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384560000 24 great game. its super addictive. but it is super confusing sometimes and it is hard yet that is a great part of the game.
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B004KSAIPA 4 1334793600 26 Mostly good. Really not bad. Just kinda okay. Works to kill time. Decent distraction. Like it enough to keep it on my phone. Basically not junk.
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B00ATSBIIG 5 1369872000 20 This game is not the one I thought it was but it's still a very good game. Lots of fun.
A10FSLJ39NOZKX B00AREIAI8 5 1364083200 23 its great fun if you love horses. especially getting to train them and compete in compitetions. I recommend this game for horse lovers
A10FTOMW4TV852 B009G1J62C 5 1365638400 22 This is a good game for children. It takes logic to figure out how to build a contraption to reach the goal.
A10FTOMW4TV852 B006BDHAX0 5 1375401600 26 This is a thinking game that works the brain. A great way to challenge yourself and others if you want to make a game of it!
A10FX0OFEB2YTL B00IAQ3RJM 5 1405728000 21 I love puzzle-type games.  This is a fun time-waster with appealing &#34;monsters&#34; to match and clear.  One of my new favorites.
A10FY77Q39OSEV B00BXPQN2K 5 1389744000 20 This is a very fun game and I suggest that you buy this game for days and days of FUN!
A10FY77Q39OSEV B00H526IU2 5 1394409600 22 Very Fun and very  intriguing game that keeps my attention for hours. I highly recommend this game for everyone of all ages.
A10FY77Q39OSEV B00EW0XSP8 5 1380931200 51 This game is a fun and puzzling game for all ages. It's hard to find a good game anymore, so I was really impressed with this one. It doesn't get boring and there are always things to do. But it!!!! And thank you for making an AMAZING game!!!!!!!!!SERIOUSLY BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
A10FYO3GPFWEYG B004UID2LC 5 1360713600 45 You can watch videos that you save, even without wifi (need to save first)  I've also saved music as an mp3 and you have full songs for free! I would get this app no matter the other bad reviews. This has more benifits than thought.
A10FYO3GPFWEYG B006D1ONE4 5 1327968000 27 This game is perplexing, but so much fun. I have this on my Kindle Fire and it works great. Even though it costs money, it's worth it.

A10G9YN99MBWQY B004U6KEH4 5 1326412800 22 I love this game! The perfect app to pass time on the toilet. It's also great to just sit and pass time!
A10G9YN99MBWQY B00J3YLQF2 5 1399161600 21 really fun and adds more to the game than the original fish farm like skill points and cross breeding. Really fun!
A10G9YN99MBWQY B009UX2YAC 5 1385251200 22 Awesome game. That's all I can really say about it. Just awesome. Wonderful animation and always gives you something to play for
A10G9YN99MBWQY B0064TVQ5E 5 1343347200 26 I was first introduced to the game on my computer, but it was different. this is much funner. I just love it so much! So fun!
A10G9YN99MBWQY B0054JZC6E 5 1330473600 21 very fun is all I can explain it with. anyways it's a good way to be involved in stuff. so yeah.
A10G9YN99MBWQY B00769WNK8 5 1330128000 30 Definitely for people who into the &quot; I'm ready for anything&quot; catagory.( I don't fall into that very much) So this game is quite fun. It makes my reflexes faster.

A10GA7R9NMF85E B008CPZNL6 5 1383436800 25 I love it i can get all my news from one place, easy to add magazines and save articles to read at  a later time
A10GCUGWYOTDWA B0069G5Z9K 4 1369440000 22 I think that this is a game that has been very well self explanatory about something like an app that is very
A10GCUGWYOTDWA B00AQ5KYVE 1 1368921600 39 Didn't do anything.All that happened was; &#34;why does (he/she) get to do that?!&#34;And this just made it worse because when I had a busy week, my kids cry because they didn't get a camping trip or ice cream, etc.
A10GCUGWYOTDWA B00CSR2J9I 5 1376352000 23 I love this app. I play it all the time. A great time killer. I highly reccomend Hill Climb Racing. Plus its free.
A10GHDP94GBSQI B008R9OIUO 4 1356566400 36 Haven't had a lot of time to play it yet as I just got it for my new Kindle Fire HD.  So far it's great.  Keeps you on your toes looking for items.  It's also inexpensive
A10GHDP94GBSQI B0063GORYU 5 1357862400 31 Makes you concentrate on where to make your next move.  Can be frustrating if you don't pay attention.  Is also addicting, but I love it.  Happy I ordered it from Amazon.
A10GHDP94GBSQI B0066T0BTO 5 1356566400 20 I enjoy this game very much and is every bit as good as others online.  It's inexpensive and takes concentration.
A10GHDP94GBSQI B0063IH60K 5 1356566400 24 Can't say much about solitaire except I love playing it.  This particular game is easy to play and somewhat relaxing.Also it's a free game.
A10GHDP94GBSQI B00FAPF5U0 5 1382659200 57 It is great!  The same as on Facebook.  I had to find out that it only worked with Wi Fi or I would have to start all over.  That was because I wasn't paying attention to what the screen was telling me to do.  I'm so glad Amazon decided to make it available for the Kindle Fire.
A10GLBE652T2FT B00B2V66VS 1 1361750400 22 I deleted this app.  After I downloaded it and opened it I saw that this was just not my kind of game.
A10GLBE652T2FT B00AOA9BL0 1 1359158400 20 I opened and looked at Xfinity TV player and decided that I would never use it so I deleted it.
A10GLBE652T2FT B007OX09MA 5 1359158400 20 It is wonderful having the Mormon Channel with me at all times.  Beautiful messages to inspire me and to share.
A10GLBE652T2FT B008AIGWVA 1 1382400000 22 I was very disappointed in this app.  It was very limited.  It got boring always seeing it with the same background setting.
A10GLBE652T2FT B00B20CMJE 1 1361750400 25 After I downloaded and opened this game I saw that it was just not for me.  I'm sure there are otheres who love this typed.
A10GLBE652T2FT B007D3JV84 4 1359158400 24 I have experimented with Sound Effects once.  The sounds are really neat and fun.  I haven't come across a way to use them yet.
A10GLBE652T2FT B00D6SBOWG 5 1380153600 20 I don't enjoy golf but I enjoy this fun form of Silitaire.  I love the graphics.  Fun Fun Fun Fun
A10GLBE652T2FT B00B7PKAKC 1 1361750400 24 This was not good for my young grandson.  His parents decided that they want to keep him away from zombies.  They give him nightmares.
A10GLBE652T2FT B00AFCEIB0 5 1359158400 21 Google and yahoo are my favorite search engines.  I love having it available at a touch.  I use search engines everyday.

A10GLBE652T2FT B0052832G4 4 1359158400 24 I enjoy playing Doodle Hunt as a relaxing pass time.  My five year old grandson really likes to play it when he comes over.

A10GLBE652T2FT B00768WTXA 5 1360540800 23 i really enjoy playing the game for relaxation and to fill in waiting time. This is great for my recovery from brain surgery.
A10GLBE652T2FT B0063IH60K 5 1359158400 21 Solitaire is a relaxing game for me and a great pass timer. I like all the different settings that are available.

A10GLVITSITGSA B00701L5XS 5 1342569600 169 This app is one of the best references I've ever seen for tying knots.  There is a quick animation for each type of knot, and you can rotate the image 360 degrees so you can get a good look at it.  The app also describes the uses for each knot and its advantages and disadvantages.  It covers just about every knot you could ever need to tie, though disappointingly, it leaves out necktie knots entirely.It works great on my Motorola Xoom tablet (though only in portrait mode) and my HTC Evo LTE.EDIT:  When I originally wrote this review, the app was loaded with spyware such as OpenFeint and Flurry and a ton of permissions.  Since then, the developer has listened to the reviews and removed all that junk.  The new version of this app has no permissions and no spyware!This is a 5-star app and a definite must-purchase for anyone who goes camping, fishing, sailing or climbing, or anyone who just wants to learn to tie a proper knot.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004UBUK4Q 5 1304121600 99 Come on, developers, this is how you do it!  The game works wonderfully on the Xoom.  The larger screen probably makes it easier to play than on a tiny phone.It's pretty much your standard castle defense game, build guns to stop invading forces, make money for each enemy unit you destroy, spend money on more and better guns.  Lather, rinse, repeat.There does seem to be a slight bug in this version of Hex Defense, at no time did the laser turrets appear to actually fire (i.e., no beam), even fully upgraded, throughout they did still damage the enemy units.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004VOJT0I 3 1311465600 25 Doesn't work so well on the Xoom tablet. The app only runs in portrait mode, and doesn't fill the whole screen most of the time.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006SMLAMQ 2 1332115200 170 This is a very pretty app, I will give them that.  It has lots of lovely animations for each different type of weather.  But the app has so many flaws and there are other weather apps available that are much better.The app cannot find your location automatically, you have to type it in manually.  This could be rather annoying if you travel a lot.It can't display the current conditions, only a forecast?  That's a pretty huge omission as well.While the description talks about widgets, there are no actual home screen widgets to be found.46.6 Megabyte download?  That's a lot of space for something that doesn't do that much.The app doesn't indicate the source of their forecast data, but I find it rather dubious.  Every other source I've checked (Accuweather, the Weather Channel, Intellicast, Foreca, Weather Underground, and the NWS) shows the weather for today will be stormy, but this app is forecasting partly cloudy?I'd recommend a former FAotD, Elecont's excellent, if unfortunately named,Weather, USA Radar, Alerts, Quake, Barometerover this app.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006T4IJTK 2 1334793600 50 This app looks a lot like it was someone's first attempt at programming a game.  In fact, it looks rather like a game I wrote in BASIC on my Atari 800 when I was a teenager.  I can't believe anyone would have the nerve to ask for money for it.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004L5WS2S 5 1309046400 113 When I first saw this game, I thought it looked a lot like Air Traffic Chaos, and indeed, it does share some of the same mechanics, albeit in a much simplified form.Like ATC, you have to clear planes to land, send them to a gate, direct them to refuel or get repairs, then authorize them for take off.  Unlike ATC however, planes cannot crash into one another and the actual sequence of events is greatly shortened (e.g., aircraft take off almost right away instead of having to wait for pull back, taxiing to the runway and then taking off).  The game also lacks the complicated radio communications of ATC.Works great on the Xoom.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006P552CA 3 1336867200 63 Not much to say about this app, it's basically 8 mini-games all of which are about smashing pots. Smash 3 identical pots, smash pots to spell words, smash pots that add up to 11, smash pots in numerical order, etc. Most of these mini-games involve quick thinking, so if you're into brain exercise-type games, then go for it, otherwise don't waste your money.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0074OZ29O 1 1333756800 169 I really dislike games with fiddly controls like this.  You have to be almost pixel perfect in where you place the balloons if you want to earn all 3 stars.  On level 1-4, the last one in which you receive hints, I had to try 5 or 6 times to get the balloons JUST RIGHT to get a perfect score, even though the game shows you exactly where you're supposed to place them.  I gave the next level, the first with no hints, about 20 attempts before growing tired of it and exiting.But you cannot exit!  The game continues to run with Foreground level priority and consuming 20% of the CPU even after pressing the Home key.  I had to kill it manually using Watchdog.I like the fact that the game shows your previous flight path and the locations of your balloons when you retry the level, and the graphics are kind of cute, but the fussiness of the balloon placement just sucks all the fun out of it.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006ON41FC 5 1329523200 51 I got this game as the Free App of the Day at around 2:30 in the morning, and decided to try it out right then.  Next thing I knew, it was almost 5 am!  It's very simple, but most highly addictive games usually are.  Plus the squirrel character is really cute.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0053R08CU 5 1341792000 313 This app is exactly what it calls itself, a jigsaw puzzle.  The game has over 150 different images and you can create puzzles with your own pictures.  There is also a challenge mode which blacks out some of the squares; the hidden areas are revealed every 5 seconds.The game has a fairly large number of options.  You can choose between square or rectangular puzzles and you have the option of plain or the more traditional jigsaw-shaped pieces.  To make the game easier, you can lock matched pieces together, snap pieces to the game board, or have a faint guide image behind the board.  Each puzzle has eight difficulty levels (five on a phone), ranging from 9 pieces up to 100 (49 on a phone).I encountered a few minor issues when moving pieces.  Sometimes they didn't track my finger properly, and if you had snap pieces to game board turned off and lock pieces together turned on, it was difficult to get the game to recognize the puzzle was finished unless you lined it up on the game board just right, even though all the pieces were stuck together.I ran this app through Addons Detector and it has only two add on modules, Amazon Licensing, which is to be expected of an app coming from Amazon, and Application Crash Report for Android (ACRA).  The latter is probably the reason the app requires Internet permissions.Ultimate Jigsaw Puzzle HD has more puzzles and more options thanSpectrum Puzzles, and it handles a large screen tablet better, but the latter has fewer frustrations when moving pieces around and also allows rotation of pieces, making for a much more challenging game.  Spectrum is $1 cheaper, but adding the two image packs to give it the same number of images makes it cost $1 more.  Personally I'd choose Spectrum Puzzles over this app, but only by a fairly slim margin.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006ZE9Q5A 3 1334275200 147 This app starts out like your typical hidden-object game, but then you find much more.  Some of the levels require you to solve riddles and find the answers hidden in the room, others require that you put objects back into the scene.  And there are numerous other mini-game puzzles, all of which can be skipped if you don't feel like playing them.This would be at least a 4, maybe even a 5 star app, except the images are so blurry when you zoom in that it's often hard to tell what the heck you're looking at. At times I had to resort to random clicking because I couldn't figure out what some of the objects were. That blob was a pillow? Coulda fooled me.The app runs well on my Motorola Xoom LTE and HTC Evo 3D, though it runs letterboxed and not full screen on the latter.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0078GZ1HG 2 1336003200 133 The game play in iStunt 2 is better than most "stunt" games I've tried before likeTrial Xtreme,Turbo GranniesorZombie Rider.  The tilt controls work quite well on my Motorola Xoom.This app cannot be moved to the SD card and it takes up 36MB of storage. -1 star for that.I might have given this app 4 stars, but there is in-app purchasing everywhere.  Want more levels? Gotta pay for it.  Want to unlock new characters or abilities and don't want to play for weeks to earn enough coins to afford them?  That'll cost you too.  (The cheapest unlockable character with a special ability is 4000 coins, and you only earn about 15 coins per level.)  Stuck on a level?  You can spend money to skip it.  -2 stars for in-app purchasing in a pay game.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006VW94HQ 5 1342828800 156 Word to Word is a word association puzzle game. You are given two columns of words and you have to match together words that are related; they can be synonyms (hot-warm), antonyms (hot-cold), compound words (hot-dog) or merely related in some way (hot-summer). Higher levels will have multiple possible matches for some words, making the game much trickier. The game comes with 440 puzzles.This game is a lot of fun and is actually pretty challenging, especially on the later puzzles. It's also one of the more unique games I've seen so far.The game works great on my Motorola Xoom tablet.The best part of this app is that there is absolutely no villainy on the part of the developer. No In-App Purchasing. No OpenFeint, Flurry or other data miners. No permissions of any kind! It's also a relatively small app, at 3.3 MB. And it only costs 99 cents! This is the way to write an app!
A10GLVITSITGSA B0052UZIFA 1 1306800000 87 74 Megabytes?  Are the developers INSANE?To put this in perspective, Angry Birds is 19 MB, Majesty is 14 MB, PewPew 2 is 14 MB, Zenonia 2 is 13 MB, and Fruit Ninja is 12 MB.  You could install ALL of these games in the same amount of space Plants vs. Zombies consumes, and still have room left over for Wordsmith (2 MB).This kind of wasteful programming should be discouraged.  There is absolutely no reason this app should be this bloated; it's just sloppy coding, plain and simple.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004R1LNGS 1 1324684800 175 They recently "upgraded" this software.  Now you are limited to one device per e-mail account; unless you have more than one e-mail address, you'll have to pay an extra $4 a month.  And features that used to be free, like location history, you've got to pay for that now too.And once you "upgrade" your software, your old account is useless.  Hope you don't lose your phone before getting the new account setup!It doesn't work correctly with the Swype keyboard on my HTC Evo 3D.I installed it on my Motorola Xoom 4G and then tried to send an alarm to the tablet.  It pops up with a screen that wants me to type in my e-mail address and password, but it won't let me actually type anything!  I had to reboot the tablet to clear the lock screen.While it found my tablet with scary precision, it thinks my phone is on the other side of the county!  It also took a considerable amount of time after sending the alarm command before it actually made any noise.
A10GLVITSITGSA B00634GHJA 3 1335052800 513 This app is buggy on my Motorola Xoom.  The address it tells me to type into my web browser is incorrect.  It shows the tablet's address as 192.168.20.1, but I know for a fact that it should be 192.168.101.151.  The address the app is showing isn't even on the same network.  Typing in the correct address gave me the app's web interface, but when I tried to upload a photo, the app force closed.  The picture did show up in the Gallery, however.  The app always runs in portrait mode.The app works correctly on my HTC Evo 3D.  It was able to download .MPO files from the 3D camera, but it could not upload them.Transferring pictures from my Evo to my Xoom was flawless, though I had to hit refresh devices several times on the Xoom to get it to see the Evo.  Transferring from the Xoom to the Evo, on the other hand, had problems.  Automatic discovery would not work and I had to manually enter the IP address.  Again, the Xoom displayed the wrong address but entering the correct address worked perfectly.-----There is no option to put pictures in any other folder other than the default PhotoGallery; you'll have to use another app if you want to organize your pictures on your device.There is no password on this app's web interface; if it's running, anyone who can figure out your IP address can upload photos or videos to your device or download any photos you have selected.  There are network scanner apps that can identify the IP addresses of every machine on a network and what ports are open on those devices.  Indeed, when I ranFing - Network Toolson my tablet, I was able to find the open port on my phone in less than 15 seconds.This app is hard coded to use port 8080, which is a common alternate port for web servers and thus a frequent target for hackers.  There is no option to change the port number.The app is only usable if it is currently on the screen.  If you leave the app for any reason or turn off the screen, it shuts down.  That means you cannot use your phone to do anything else while transferring pictures.  At least this does limit the exposure of the device to network snooping.-----This app would be useful for transferring pictures from phone to phone, phone to tablet or any such combination, or downloading them to a computer when you don't have a cable with you (copying photos from your phone to your laptop in a coffee shop, for instance).  But the app is limited to photos and video only, uploads are rather clunky and it has some potential security issues.  If this app had the option for a password, I'd give it 4 stars.I would recommendWiFi File Explorer PRO(another former FAotD) over this app.  It lets you transfer any type of file, to and from any folder on your device, it has a configurable port number and optional password protection, it can run in the background, and it's $1 cheaper.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004Z92T9W 3 1314316800 166 "Don't be fooled by imitations--this is the real thing, published by the original manufacturer, Konami.  You get the same look and feel"Sorry, but the graphics, sound effects and gameplay are nothing at all like the original.  While the graphics are  an improvement over the 80s, the music and sound effects are way worse.  The game looks and sounds much too cutesy now.  The gameplay has also been changed to make the game easier, for instance, the turtles no longer dive underwater until you reach the third level, and the traffic moves much slower.The game also has significant lag at times, which makes it rather frustrating.  There also seems to be a slight clipping issue with the trucks; several times I got killed jumping behind a truck when I should have been clear.  At least once I died for no apparent reason.  Otherwise it works well on the Motorola Xoom tablet.Overall, it's an OK "modernized" port of Frogger, just don't buy this expecting the original arcade version.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005AKPLYK 4 1309996800 194 What's with developers who don't make their apps tablet compatible?  The tablet industry is about to explode with at least a dozen different models already out or on their way this year.  I don't recall there being this much reluctance over developing for the iPad.Anyway, this game actually does work on the Motorola Xoom tablet, with a few minor graphical issues (text items are screwed up beyond any hope of readability, units near the bottom of the screen cannot be upgraded because they are too close to the buttons), but the game is completely playable and enjoyable.  I made it all the way through wave 100 on the first map.I'm docking the app one star because of the excessive file size.  I find it highly unlikely that a game like this, even with "high definition" graphics, requires 38 Megabytes. Previous App of the Day tower defense games Guns 'n' Glory and HexDefense were 14 MB and 7 MB, respectively.  (Please, no "Durr, move to SD" comments.  Excessive app size is a sign of sloppy programming.)  $2.99 also seems a wee bit high given the prices of these other two games (99 and $1.49, respectively).
A10GLVITSITGSA B007ZRZF8I 1 1339027200 171 In this game, your character runs in a single direction, and you can reverse gravity to run on the floor or the ceiling to avoid obstacles.  There are no other controls, just tap the screen to switch.  That's it.  Yes, it really is as dull as it sounds.I might have given this app 3 stars for its mediocrity, but the developer chose to include in-app purchasing.  I would have no problem with this if the app were free, but when game developers start wanting to nickle and dime you in a paid app, it's time for people to put their foot down.This app has OpenFeint installed, even though there is no button for it or mention of it in the description.  If you put your phone into Airplane mode and start the game, you'll get a Feint offline notice at the bottom of the screen.If you like this sort of game, I'd recommendYoo Ninja! (Ad-Free)instead.  It's the same price, same type of game, but without in-app purchasing and without secret OpenFeint.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006YVGOA4 4 1336953600 62 This app is great for learning or identifying those mysterious and sometimes downright confusing chords and scales.As a bonus, the app comes with the full version of Mini Piano Pro.I did encounter some problems with Staff View; the majority of the time hitting play resulted in either a terrible disharmony or no sound at all.  All other modes seem to work normally.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007TLOYZU 1 1337212800 137 Yet another game that wants you to pay for the app and then pay again to play it.  Come on developers, stop trying to emulate EA, they were voted the Worst Company in America.108 Megabytes?  For a game that's basically an Angry Birds clone with just the black bird?  Really?  Angry Birds, Angry Birds Seasons, Angry Birds Rio and Angry Birds Space COMBINED take up less space than this monstrosity.And to top it off, the game isn't even fun.  Throwing power and angle don't seem to be consistent; half my grenades end up flying off the screen, the other half end up falling at my own feet (too bad you can't blow yourself up).  There's nothing to indicate how you threw the previous grenade, so if you miss just slightly, you can't just tweak your next shot.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006R8GK2Q 4 1340582400 107 This app is a fairly typical hidden-object game.  There isn't really much too distinguish it from the 90 or so other HO-type games currently available on Amazon.  It has a good story line, and the graphics are good enough, though occasionally a bit blurry on my Xoom tablet.It's a bit confusing when your character keeps saying she needs to find one particular item, like a doll or a watch, but then you start searching for a dozen things that aren't that one item.I would have given this game 5 stars, but I'm docking one because it keeps bugging me to log into Facebook or rate the app.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0063222V4 2 1336780800 386 I received Audubon Birds as Free App of the Day, which lead me to buying the Flower, Tree and Butterfly Guides as well, and all of these were great, so I decided to go ahead and round out my collection with the remaining Audubon Guide apps while there were still on sale.Unfortunately, Audubon Insects appears to be the weakest of all the Audubon apps.  Insects are the most numerous creatures on this planet, yet this app only has 510 entries, and many of those are only at the genus-level, not individual species.  I could not find any entry for the Box Elder Bug (Boisea trivittata), which are very plentiful around here, and the app has only a single species of millipede, the large North American Millipede, Narceus americanus.The number of photos is rather limited, with most species having only a single photo.While all the other Audubon apps have range maps, Insects & Spiders does not.  There is range description text for each listing, but this often quite vague ("Western North America", for instance).The app has an option to download the entire database, which in the other apps is enormous, but with Insects is a mere 160 MB.  If you choose not to download the database, it will consume bandwidth if you have a limited data plan.The app has an advanced search function, but it only has 5 parameters: shape, habitat, region, color and size.If an insect has alternative names, the app does not allow you to search for them; you can only search using the primary name and scientific name.  For instance, I wanted to look up the June Bug, but it didn't show up in a search.  I finally managed to find it by using Google to find the genus name, Phyllophaga.  The app listed this particular bug as a May Beetle, and although it showed June Bug as an alternate name, it wouldn't let me search using that term.Like the other Audubon apps, this app lets you keep a life list, record sightings and take photos, and then upload them to AudubonGuides.com.This app crashes frequently when starting up, but it will start successfully on the second attempt.  This occurs with both my Motorola Xoom tablet and my HTC Evo 3D phone.On my tablet, the app constantly switches back and forth between portrait and landscape.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005KMOP9K 3 1332892800 256 I enjoyed the game Lights Out.  I still have an original 17 year old hardware version from Tiger Electronics.  The developer claims "Lights Off" is "The Original Game", but it clearly isn't.One my Motorola Xoom, the screen is a bit messed up.  The buttons are off-center and cover up the logo, but the game is still totally playable.  There's also no sound.  I'm not sure if that's intentional or a bug.  (EDIT: It's a bug.  Other reviewers have complained about the volume being too loud.  Maybe it's not such a bad bug then?)This version of the game keeps track of how many moves you have made in the current puzzle, but doesn't display the minimum number of moves required.  If I solved a puzzle in 10 moves, is that good or bad?  (Just to test, I pressed buttons randomly and took 127 moves to solve one puzzle.  The game just moved on to the next level like nothing was unusual.)  The game doesn't let you see your previous scores and it clears the score just seconds after completing a puzzle.There also doesn't appear to be any way to go back and retry previously solved puzzles, nor can you have multiple players on a single device.  The only way to reset the game is to go into the Settings for your device, find the game under Applications and press the Clear Data button.There are a ton of Lights Out clones out there, many of them for free.  This version doesn't offer anything extra for your 99 cents.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0061S0A64 5 1334707200 104 When I first started playing around with the app, I wasn't too impressed with it. OK, it can make some musicy sounding notes. But what else can it do?Then I started poking around in the settings. That's where the beauty of this app is. You can completely change the sound of the notes, make them drift around, change scales and octaves and do all kinds of effects. This has the potential to make some very interesting music.My only complaint about the app is it could use more instructions. I had to figure out what a lot of the stuff does through trial and error.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006IY163C 2 1324771200 89 Seriously, the 2600 sucked.  The 400/800 had much better graphics.  I would gladly pay for the Atari 400/800 version of Star Raiders, but I wouldn't want the 2600 version even if you paid me.  Alas, that's all that's available in this app, arcade versions (which are great) and 2600 versions (which are terrible).This app also doesn't appear to have any way to display what games you own and which ones you don't, it just mixes them all together.  I'd give it 3 stars if it at least did that.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0066T8M1I 3 1325030400 226 So this isn't even an beta version?  EA is shipping alpha stage products to paying customers now?I guess that would explain the bugs.  The worst bug is that the trading screen is utterly broken; tapping anywhere selects properties almost at random.  There is a display bug in the history window that makes it look like I'm paying rent twice (at least I hope that's a display bug and not the computer cheating and taking my money twice!)  I also had a hard time selecting a game room; you could swipe right easily, but it only registered swiping left 1 out of 5 or 6 times.  I only played for about 15 minutes, so there's probably a bunch more bugs I haven't encountered yet.In the time I tested the app, after selecting the house rule to evenly distribute the properties and with 1 AI opponent, I landed on the computer's properties 10 times and the computer landed on one of my properties 3 times.  That's not really a big enough sample to prove the AI is cheating, but it does seem to show some bias.The AI offers absolutely terrible trades.  The computer asked for Boardwalk, giving it a monopoly, and offered two low rent properties that didn't give me anything.  Riiiiight...$5 is a bit much for an app even the publisher admits isn't even a beta yet.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006YFO31C 3 1334102400 112 Not much to say about this app.  It's your standard bubble shooter game.  It has two modes, one where you try to clear the board (called "story mode" for some reason; there is no story that I've been able to find) and an endless mode.The problem here is that this game isn't really anything special.  If developer had at least made the birds different species, instead of being all identical except for color, then he might have had a little something to differentiate it from the zillions of other bubble shooter games out there.Is the game worth 99 cents?  Sure, it's a decent time-waster.  But so are all the other bubble shooters.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007375V4I 4 1340496000 208 The game of MASH has been around for ages; I can remember playing this when I was a kid. Of course, we had to use paper back in the Middle Ages. Now you can play on your phone or tablet.In the basic version, you enter various locations, jobs, vehicles, colors, names, numbers, and animals--you can type your entries or use the randomize button to have them entered for you--and it will come up with a prediction about your future, such as, "Once you graduate, you'll find work in Portland, Oregon as a Veterinarian. You'll get around town in your burgundy scooter. You'll marry Alexis and live in a Mansion with your 44 kids and ever-loyal pet pony."The paid "Elite" version of MASH lets you download additional stories; there are currently 18 available. These include games such as Superhero, Championship Football Game, Rumors and Dear Diary.This app is not optimized for tablets; on my Xoom it only runs in portrait mode and the buttons are very small. It looks much better on my Evo LTE.Overall it's a cute little app, loads of fun for kids, or nostalgic adults who remember playing this in their youth. I'd give it 5 stars, but I'm currently docking one for poor tablet support.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005BFMQJC 4 1310256000 136 This game reminds me a bit of Nanaca Crash, a really simple and really stupid game but something about it compels you to keep trying over and over again to break your own record.I'm not sure I'd be willing to pay 99 cents for this app.  Can you sell apps for 50 cents or is 99 cents the floor for apps?A mode where you have to fly the plane past assorted obstacles would be a nice addition.  Or maybe a mode where you have to pass through various targets to get boosts or extra wind.  The addition of either of these would probably make the app worth the 99 cents.  I'd also like to see more airplane designs available for purchase, not just color variations of the same design.It works great on the Motorola Xoom tablet.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0062YYSTW 1 1335484800 145 Out of curiosity, I tried doing a Google search using the instructions in several of the recipes.  The recipes appear to have all been copied from a site called Recipe Goldmine.  Although it's possible there is a connection between the app developer and the website, I rather doubt that, as Recipe Goldmine has a US contact address, while hidtechs has an Indian address.  I have sent an e-mail to the owner of the website and will update this review with their reply once I receive it.The app contains numerous instances where it's supposed to display an accented character but doesn't have the proper coding for it, resulting in gibberish, for instance, saute' becomes sautA(C).  The developer didn't even bother to proof-read the recipes.EDIT:  I received this reply from the owner of Recipe Goldmine: "No, I did not give permission for those recipes to be used."
A10GLVITSITGSA B004QJGPNM 1 1302739200 25 Doesn't work on the Xoom. All I get is a black screen when game play starts.  Glad this was free or I'd be rather annoyed.
A10GLVITSITGSA B00840HIUS 1 1339286400 174 This is yet another app that wants to nickel and dime the player after purchase. Or in this case, more like $10 and $20 the player. I managed to earn about 250 to 300 points per game, but the best ball in the game costs 847,000 points! I'd have to play over 25,000 frames just to afford that one ball! Unlocking all the lanes requires 337,500 points, which would require playing this game over 1,000 times! Purchasing 650,000 points costs $5, while 7,000,000 is a whopping $20, so unlocking all the alleys plus that one ball will cost you $10. Keep in mind that you lose everything you purchased if you ever have to reinstall the game.And to top things off, the app also has OpenFeint, with no option to disable it.On the positive side, at least the controls are greatly improved over the original Let's Bowl, but they still leave something to be desired.If you want a bowling game, try PBA Bowling 2. It's a couple bucks more, but the balls are free.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007QTSROE 5 1337212800 79 This is one of the best games I've played in a while.  It is a 2D side-scrolling shooter, nothing new there, but with a very unique, old-timey sepia-toned paper drawing appearance.The gamepad can be resized, a great feature I wish other developers would adopt.  And there are no permissions whatsoever, another feature programmers would do well to imitate.My only complaint is that if you die, you have to start the level over from the beginning, that's a bit annoying.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007TCMOY2 1 1340496000 146 This app tries to be a series of puzzles, but what it succeeds at is being annoying.  Many of the puzzles have no instructions, so you have to try to guess at what it wants you to do.  There are also at least a few "trick question" puzzles.Worst of all, however, is the controls are completely broken.  Objects don't follow your finger correctly, and there is at least one maze level that is extremely hard to finish because of this.Often, if you make a mistake, the game forces you to start over several puzzles previous.  Since the puzzles are all exactly the same each time, it can become annoying have to hit the same items repeatedly just to get back to where you were.If you're thinking of buying a puzzle game, just keep walking.  If you pay money for this app, you've already failed the test.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006RA13BW 3 1333411200 118 I tried giving this app to my kids, but they got frustrated that they couldn't use it with their hooves, so they headbutted the screen then went back to chewing their cud.-----Seriously, though, this app has all the appeal of popping bubble wrap.  Except bubble wrap is usually free, while this app normally costs 99 cents.  I can't see anyone but maybe a VERY young child, or someone autistic, who would be entertained by it for more than a couple minutes.There are a bunch of free balloon popping and even balloon inflating apps available.  I haven't tried it, but it looks likeBalloon Popwould be a better choice, since it can also teach numbers while your child is popping.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006H7TC3Q 1 1337817600 177 When this app works, it sometimes produces passable looking sketches.  I uploaded to Amazon the one sketch I managed to save as an example.Unfortunately, 60% of the time (quite literally, 6 out of 10 attempts), the software just exited without warning and without any sort of error message.  Poof!  Gone!But even when it doesn't crash, it still doesn't work!  I tried to save the images I created, and it displayed a message that the photos were saved, but when I plugged my tablet into my computer, lo and behold, the folder I saved them in was empty!  The only way I was able to actually save an image was to e-mail it to myself.The controls are just terrible.  It takes entirely too many taps to do anything, and the menus love hiding themselves.  The tabs to open the menus are so tiny it's hard to hit them.The app runs in portrait mode, but opening the gallery or using the camera causes it to switch to landscape.Until they get some of these bugs ironed out, save your money.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007IUKQGS 3 1338508800 111 This app is your basic Lingo-style game; guess the word based on the first letter.  You can choose 5, 6 or 7 letter words.I like the game show Lingo, and I enjoyedLingroveafter they got the bugs worked out, but this game utterly failed to keep my attention.  It is extremely bland, like eating plain oatmeal.  There is a huge gulf between the keyboard and the letter boxes that goes completely unused, about 1/3 of the screen.  It looks incomplete, like someone just slapped it together and didn't really care about the design.On a positive note, the app is quite small and requires no permissions.  It works well on my Motorola Xoom.
A10GLVITSITGSA B00659XNK4 3 1335312000 158 The difficulty level is all over the place in this game.  Selecting the 3 star animal level, the first three words it gave were GIRAFFE, KOALA and OWL.If you accidentally move a letter tile too close to a slot, it will stick there and cannot be moved, even if it's in the wrong spot.  You have to fill in the rest of the slots, then it will kick out the incorrect letters and you can try again.While saying the letter on each tile might be useful for beginners, by the time your child reaches level 3, they should be familiar with the letters by then.The sound effects in the animal levels get really annoying after a while.There are apparently only a handful of words, because they get repeated frequently.  I encountered KIWI 3 times in less than 7 words.I'm 38 years old and I've never seen a quince before, how is a little kid supposed to recognize it?
A10GLVITSITGSA B004HIGDV6 3 1304380800 83 The app has been updated and now it works correctly on the Xoom.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This app sort of works with the front-facing camera on the Motorola Xoom.  The preview doesn't work right, everything looks all stretched and distorted, but when it actually takes the pictures, the result looks normal.I suppose the $2 cost of the app is less then what a set of photos from a real photobooth would cost, but this app doesn't seem to have much use beyond its single, kitchy purpose.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0073XT3GY 5 1339372800 256 In this physics-based puzzle game, you play Mr. Weasel, head of Weasel's Skool 4 Huntin' Chickens. Your students set out to raid a chicken coop, but are instead captured by the farmer. So you do the obvious thing, strap a rocket to your back and try to rescue them!While the game sounds like a clone of Angry Birds, and you do indeed launch the titular character across the screen, the similarity ends there. In Angry Birds, you basically just slam yourself into obstacles, but in Rocket Weasel, you have to try numerous strategies to accomplish your mission. You might have to light firecrackers or burn ropes with your rocket exhaust, avoid leaping porcupines, deploy a parachute, or trigger crazed squirrels armed with mallets. There are even a few levels that have Rube Goldberg-like contraptions.I must say that this is one of the most imaginative and well animated Android games I think I've ever seen. I found it to be even more fun than Angry Birds. The character designs are wonderful and the game is full of surprises, like the little animations Mr. Weasel does if you leave the game idle.The app includes a link to the developer's website where you can vote for a new rocket type to be used in a future update, or suggest your own rocket ideas. I love it when a developer is committed to providing updates to their product.It works perfectly and looks gorgeous on my Motorola Xoom LTE with ICS.For only 99 cents, this game is a definite must buy.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006XIR9KM 5 1334880000 196 At first glance, this is just Memory with fancy new graphics. And then the tiles start moving around! And the clock is counting down, so you'd better hurry! And what you thought was just a simple matching game suddenly becomes a serious challenge. You not only have to remember what symbols were where, but you have to track them with your peripheral vision as they start moving around.Studies show that regular mental stimulation can improve your intelligence and help protect against cognitive decline and memory loss associated with aging. This is a great game for exercising your brain. It stimulates your short-term memory, decision-making abilities, and hand-eye coordination. It's also great for "warming up" your brain prior to an exam, interview, meeting or conference.If you find the game too fast-paced at first, you can start out with Basic mode, which has no time limit and no penalties for mistakes. As your improve, you can move up to Survival mode, which also has no time limit but penalizes errors, then Timed mode, where the clock is reset with each match, and finally Speed mode, where you have only 60 seconds to make as many matches as possible.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004S80UUU 3 1305676800 56 Unless you've got amazing twitch reflexes, this truly is an impossible game.  Make the slightest mistake at any point and you have to start the level over.  If you like that sort of thing, then this is the game for you; if not, stay clear, you'll just make yourself crazy.Works great on the EVO and Xoom.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005A89508 1 1336348800 89 An app that allows people to cheat at Scabble-type games like Words With Friends or Wordsmith?  Lovely.  So much for ever playing any of these online again.  I wonder if it would be possible for the developers of these other apps to add "PunkBuster" type checking to their apps to scan for the presence of this app.Do yourself a favor, skip this app and download a vocabulary building app instead and learn to beat people legitimately.  You'll feel better when you win using your brain instead of an app.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0059WTMLW 5 1339200000 261 EDIT:  Looks like OpenFient and Flurry have been removed from the game.  Kudos to the developer!Original review:This app is your basic Sudoku puzzle game, but it also has seven different variants, such as Color Sudoku, in which each each color must have a unique number in addition to the usual rules, and Jigsaw Sudoku, which has oddly-shaped squares.This game has one of the largest Settings menus I have seen in a long time.  Just about everything is customizable, from the level of help it gives you to the colors and fonts the app uses.The list of features in this game is enormous.  It has a full help system which can analyze the puzzle difficulty, tell you want techniques are needed to solve it, check for mistakes, fill in the pencil marks, or show your next move.  You can save multiple games in progress, and you can bookmark a particular layout so you can try a possible solution, then undo it all if you made a mistake, useful on harder puzzles where there may be several paths to follow.While this app does have OpenFeint, it asks when you start the app for the first time if you want to enable or disable it; it can also be disabled in the Settings menu.  The app also has Flurry Analytics, which can be disabled in Settings.My sole complaint about the app is there is no explanation for the different game variations, but fortunately they are pretty easy to figure out.The app works perfectly on my Motorola Xoom tablet and my HTC Evo 3D phone.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004S3MB2U 5 1319846400 151 For many years I used Calc98 on my Pocket PCs.  It was able to do just about everything, and when I switched to Android, I sorely missed it.  There just wasn't anything even remotely similar available.  Until now.NeoCal Advanced isn't just a scientific calculator.  It's also a financial calculator, a statistical calculator, a programmer's calculator, a unit converter and a date and time calculator.  It can operate in order-entered, precedence, or RPN mode.  You can switch between calculators in mid-entry, so you can, for instance, type in a hexadecimal number, perform a trigonometric function, then store the result for statistical work.It looks nice as well, and the layouts are customizable.  It works great on both my Evo 3D and my Xoom tablet.The only down side is the $10 price tag, but you'd pay that for a basic hardware scientific calculator, and considering it's 6 calculators in one, it's worth the money.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005MKRVLE 1 1340150400 376 This app is one of the most basic Sudoku apps I've ever seen. The interface is primitive and it lacks features found in many other Sudoku games.The graphics are unimpressive and amateurish. The app forces the operating system to run in portrait mode on my tablet, placing the system buttons and menus on the side of the screen, even though the app itself is reluctantly capable of displaying in landscape. There is a large amount of wasted space on the edges, and the background image falls short of covering the whole screen. When I pressed the Menu button, I got a dialog box full of gibberish. Even the icon looks boring.This app does not appear to have any way of entering pencil marks. It will fill in some marks if you press the Crib button, however it still leaves many of the spaces blank, making this feature nearly useless. Besides, I'd rather do the work myself.There is a large button labeled Solve which will start filling in the answers if you press it. Since it's right next to the numbers, and above the Undo button, I imagine it would be quite easy to hit it accidentally. It doesn't ask if you are sure you want it solved for you, it just starts doing it the instant you press it.Pressing the back button on your device exits the game rather than taking you back to the menu.The game has only 3 difficulty levels, the fewest I've seen of any Sudoku game except the ones they print in the newspaper.The permissions this app asks for are questionable. Why does it require read phone state and identity, view network state, and full Internet access? I can't find any features in this game that would require the Internet.3 stars for mediocre design, then -3 for no pencil marks, -2 for questionable permissions, -1 for having only three difficulty levels, and -1 for poor tablet interface. Inability to enter pencil marks is an absolute deal breaker for me.I'd HIGHLY recommend Sudoku 4ever Plus or Enjoy Sudoku over this app. The former has several interesting Sudoku board variants and multiple markup systems, the latter has an excellent tutorial if you're new to the game or want to learn some advanced solving techniques.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005F9Z2G8 1 1312934400 134 Of all the newspapers available, why would anyone want to read the New York Post?  It's a newspaper known for its sensationalism and downright distortion of the news.The photos in the app are very heavily dithered and look like they were scanned from a newspaper.You can't change the tabs at the top of the app, so you'd better really love gossip and sports, because you can't get rid of them.But the worst part is that this is a PAID app but it has advertisements.  You can get the exact same stories as this app for free by going to the Post's mobile website.  (In fact, the ads on the free website seem to be less obtrusive than the ones in the paid app!)  Or better yet, use the mobile website of a credible newspaper.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004S33RRI 4 1303344000 133 I have two Android device, an Evo phone and a Xoom tablet. Previously I'd used Grocery IQ for shopping lists, but syncing was a bit buggy; items I'd already removed from the list would often reappear.  Since Amazon was giving away this app, I figured I'd try it out.The interface is extremely complicated and it took quite a bit of effort to figure out how to get everything working properly.  Some features are not very well documented, particularly syncing.  I almost gave up, but I stuck with it and finally got it working.  Synchronization seems to be more reliable than Grocery IQ,  It syncs after every single change, so it may end up using more data if you're not on an unlimited plan, but since it's text, the usage should be quite minimal.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004RCD7NY 5 1337558400 355 This is an excellent reference work for anyone who needs information about nations or world regions.  Covering every country, autonomous state or disputed territory, it draws upon the World Factbook compiled by everyone's favorite spooks, the CIA.The app provides information on Transportation, Military, Economy, Population, Government and Geography.  It appears to be missing the Communications and Transnational Issues categories contained in the World Factbook and it uses just a subset of the other categories, as there is no information in the app on, from the Geography category for instance, maritime claims, land use, water resources, or environmental issues.  It is also missing the entry for the European Union, which, while not a nation per se, is a political entity of significance.The World Factbook is updated weekly, however information for specific countries may be obsolete simply due to a lack data from that nation (particularly for states with unstable or hostile governments, such as Afghanistan or North Korea).  There is no indication whether the data in this app is updated when the World Factbook updates.The app also provides a quick link to Wikipedia for more information, although in a few cases, the link points to a less useful article (Holy See rather than Vatican City, for instance).My only real complaint about this app is that it's rather tedious switching between categories.  You have to tap the icon, wait for the little selection wheel to zoom up, spin it to pick your next category, push the button and wait for it do its little zoom out animation.  This whole process takes at least 5 seconds, each and every time you want to switch categories.  The ability to just swipe left or right across the screen, like many other apps do to flip pages, would make things a lot easier.This app works great on both my Motorola Xoom tablet and my HTC Evo 3D phone.  The interface looks better on my tablet, although there is a slight quirk where it switches to portrait mode when changing the comparison reference country.If the price for this app is too high, there is a free ad-supported version available from Google Play.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005F11PEY 1 1335657600 95 The most recent update took away all the points I'd accumulated and all the levels I'd unlocked, just so they could add in-app purchasing to make me pay for more points and to unlock levels?  This isn't the first time they've erased all my progress in the game.  What's to stop them from yet again wiping out any points or levels that I might have purchased?I would have given this app 4 or 5 stars in the past, but after the developers have shown just how greedy they are, it deserves less than 1 star.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005DTZAZS 5 1341878400 456 In the year 4122, genetic experiments have brought dinosaurs back from extinction and given them intelligence. One of these intelligent creatures, called nanosaurs, was sent back 65 million years into the past to recover eggs. Upon returning to the future, however, a group of rebels stole all but one of the eggs and took them to other planets in hopes of raising an army. The sole remaining egg hatched into a pteranodon. Equipped with a jetback, it is sent through a wormhole to retrieve the stolen eggs.Nanosaur 2 is a fairly unique flight game. You control your motion by tilting your device. The blue button in the left corner is your jetback booster, the red button in the lower right fires your weapon. The green button next to it switches weapons. You start out with a blaster with 20 shots and a sonic scream which has infinite ammo and can be charged by holding the fire button. You can acquire additional ammo and new weapons, including heat-seeking missiles, fragmentation grenades and bombs, by flying through green powerups.Across the top of the screen you have a map, the number of eggs you need to collect, how many lives you have remaining (you start with 3), then your health, shield and fuel status. These three can be restored by flying through the red, purple and blue powerups, respectively; additional lives can be obtained by with the yellow powerups. Below the map is the calibrate button which you can press if your controls start acting up.The objective of the game is to fly low and grab the eggs (which will be done automatically when you get close enough), then carry them to one of the waiting wormholes where they will be sent back to Earth. If you get hit, you will drop your egg and you'll have to pick it up again. Collect all the eggs on the planet, and the wormhole will change color. Fly into it to travel to the next world. You can only save your game after completing a world.Game play is excellent and the controls are intuitive. The graphics look incredible and the game runs quite smoothly on my Motorola Xoom.My sole complaint is that there is no training mission or tutorial, you just get thrown right into the action. I died in less than 5 seconds the first time I played because I had no idea what I was doing. There is a very detailed help file, but that doesn't really make up for a lack of tutorial.The application is fairly large, over 55 MB, but it is quite a lot of game. It calls on just a single permission, Control Vibrator. Pay attention, developers, this is the way to write an app!
A10GLVITSITGSA B007Q3GY1S 4 1336176000 108 I remember playing this when I was in 2nd grade.  I never had one myself (my parents bought me a Simon instead), but a friend let me play with his.This version appears to be missing a couple buttons.  I mean, even the icon for it shows 6 buttons, 3 on each side, but this game has only 4.  This doesn't appear to affect play, however.There appears to be an minor little bug: after crossing the 50 yard line, the yard numbers continue to go up.  I got stopped on the 98 yard line.Other than those little quirks, the game play appears to be the same as I remember.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006OOI008 2 1335312000 97 (One drools, the other dribbles.)The title of this app is "Slam Dunk Basketball", but at no point do you ever do anything even close to a slam dunk.  It's just shooting hoops.  Nothing more.  You don't even have an opponent to play HORSE against.The controls are a bit tricky and several times the ball simply vanished after I tried to shoot it.Just tapping on the screen shooting the ball randomly, I made 55 points.  Trying to shoot carefully, I scored only 49 points.  Not much of a game if you can score more points with button mashing.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0050D6PH4 4 1306108800 135 This is a fairly simple yet addictive puzzle game.  If two bubbles of the same color are touching, you can pop them.  The more bubbles you pop at once, the more points you get.  Couldn't be easier, and yet like other simple puzzle games (Tetris, Bejeweled, etc), it's also highly addictive.  It also makes that great bubble wrap popping sound when you pop the bubbles.Although it says it's not compatible with all tablets, it works adequately on the Xoom.  It only fills about half the screen, and it's a bit finicky about where you tap, but it works well enough to play it as is.  This should be a fairly simple thing for the developer to fix; I hope they do so.Also works well on the Evo, though the opening animation seemed a bit sluggish.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007SPQ04A 5 1341532800 255 In Meowch!, you play a runaway cat, trying to escape the clutches of a crazy cat lady.  You leap about window ledges and light fixtures, bounce off satellite dishes, climb hanging vines and slide down gutters, avoiding power lines and Animal Control, while collecting "missing cat" posters and trying to reach a safe hiding place on the ground.At first I thought this was just an Angry Birds clone, drag your finger to launch the cat, but the second level changed that pretty quick.  You have to make multiple jumps per level, and sometimes you have to make your next leap in a hurry before you are grabbed by the cat lady.I found the cat lady to be the most difficult of the obstacles in the game; if you land on a lit window, you have only a second or two to make another jump before she grabs you and yanks you inside!  Oh noes!There is a time limit to each level, but it's about 3 minutes, and you can add another 1 minute and 40 seconds for each poster you nab, for a maximum of 8 minutes.  You shouldn't need anywhere near that much time.I love the graphics in this game, particularly some of the cat animations.  The game is fairly challenging (it took over a dozen tries to get all three posters on level 1-3), yet fairly forgiving at the same time (you'll stick to a ledge even if your landing isn't perfect).The app works perfectly and looks great on my Motorola Xoom LTE.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0058VW36U 1 1335657600 31 Used to be good, but the latest update has added in-app purchasing.  I'm sorry, but I cannot give a good rating to a pay app that expects you to pay again.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007HBA70S 1 1338595200 302 The latest update for this game erases all your progress, forcing you to start over from the very beginning.  What did the developer add to make this worth while?  In-app purchasing and advertisements!  That's right, you have to start all over again just so they can squeeze a few more bucks out of this game.  And if you do happen to make an in-app purchase, the developer has already shown they have no compunction about wiping out everything you've earned or purchased.I originally gave this app 4 stars, but because of the unmitigated greed of this developer, I'm dropping my rating to just 1 star.----------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This app is basically a story-driven collection of minigames.  There are hidden-object and jigsaw puzzle games to acquire potions, match-3 games to collect wood, and a diagonally-tilted Bejeweled style game for quarrying stone, and more.  It's also a resource-gathering game; once you have enough materials, you can construct buildings for the town, such as a sawmill or a tower.  Complete all the missions in an area and you can move on to the next part of the map.Unfortunately, it takes a lot of materials to build anything, so you're going to have to play some of those minigames over and over and over, particularly the ones for stone and wood.  That's great if you like those sorts of games; personally, I found the diagonal Bejeweled game to be frustrating, especially to get the pieces in the corners.The app looks good on my Motorola Xoom tablet and I didn't encounter any issues, although the text occasionally left much to be desired.  The developer is Russian and their translations aren't always the best ("I tore open my sack and I lost my stones."  Ouch.  Sounds painful!).If you like Bejeweled, hidden-object and other such puzzle games, you'll love this app.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005QT1KU4 3 1342915200 498 Gunship II is a Vietnam War era combat flight simulator.  The game currently offers 5 missions, with the developer claiming several more are coming soon.  The first mission is to transport a load of cargo from a carrier to a land base using an H-34 Choctaw.  Then you have to take photos of a couple suspicious villages using an H-13 Sioux.  The third mission is to rescue a pilot trapped behind enemy lines using a UH-1D Huey.  This is followed by an air patrol in a UH-1B Huey Gunship.  The final mission involves another observation helo drawing enemy fire so your AH-1 Cobra can target them.  Future missions will supposedly involve the F-4 Phantom II, T-28 Trojan, A-37 Dragonfly, CH-47 Chinook, OH-6 Cayuse and two enemy aircraft, the MiG-15 and MiG-21.The controls are fairly simple, you slide the control on the left up and down to adjust the throttle (and thus increase or decrease altitude), while the control on the bottom right works the rudder.  You move forward, backwards and sideways by tilting your device.  The camera button lets you switch between interior and exterior cameras, and you can look around by swiping on the screen.  If your aircraft has guns or a camera, the appropriate fire buttons will appear in the lower right corner.  The red bar along the top is your aircraft health.Some people have complained about a lack of instructions, but they are provided for you IF you follow the designated flight path.  Just fly through the red arrows and all will be explained.The graphics are pretty good, and the developer did a great job on the rotor motion effects.My primary complaint about the game is that there are no instruments, particularly an altimeter.  It is sometimes difficult to figure out how high you are above the ground.  An airspeed indicator and vertical speed indicator would be handy too.I think there is a glitch in the second mission.  It kept complaining I was too far away while taking the photos, even when I landed right in the middle of the area where I was supposed to take pictures!  Do they want me to get out and take portraits of the soldiers or something?  Say pho m&aacute;t!The game works well on my Motorola Xoom, however many of the buttons in the game are black with no labels at all.  This isn't a problem when there is only one button, such as at the end of a mission, but pressing the pause button brings up four blank buttons.  If you have this problem, the pause menu buttons are apparently "resume", "restart", "calibrate" and "return to menu".The app is free of In-App Purchasing, nor does it have OpenFeint, Flurry, or any other secret data miners.  The only permissions it calls on are harmless: accessing the vibrator and keeping the screen from dimming.  Excellent!Five star app, minus 1 star for the glitches and 1 for the lack of instruments.  If these are fixed, I will adjust my rating accordingly.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004T2QZL8 3 1314748800 216 I liked Alchemy, then I read that Doodle God was even better, so I downloaded the free version from the Google Market.  It worked well on my Evo 3D, and when I checked Amazon and found it available here, I decided to purchase it.Unfortunately, Amazon's version of the game is VERY far behind Google's.  The version Google has is 1.4.1.3, Amazon's is only 1.3.  It appears Amazon's version hasn't been updated in over 5 months!  Alas, this version does NOT work properly on my Evo 3D.It's a great game, but don't buy it from Amazon, get it from Google if you ever hope to see updates.  I only hope Amazon will give me my money back.EDIT:  The game finally got updated on Amazon, but now it's utterly broken.  This version has actually been pulled from Google by the developer because of all the problems, but slowpoke Amazon still has the defective version.2nd EDIT:  There is a new update which supposedly fixes the force close issue (I haven't tried it out yet).  The current version is 1.4.2.4, which actually puts it ahead of Google (which still reports version 1.4.1.6) at the moment.  Only time will tell whether the developer will keep the Amazon version up to date or if it will fall behind like in the past.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004ZFK600 5 1306195200 95 This app is an absolute must have for tablets.  If you're like me, you've probably been frustrated at the fact your Xoom or other device can't send a simple text message.  Well now you can!  And without having to pay per message fees or for expensive bundles!If your phone has SMS already, but your provider charges for messaging, this app can save you money there.If your provider gives you unlimited messaging as part of your service (like Sprint), then this app isn't as useful, but it still has a few other features like group texting.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004S2FUH4 3 1334188800 78 Everything this app does can be done using a basic calculator (or even in your head) if you know how.  But if you're not mathmatically inclined, it can greatly simplify figuring out percentages such as discounts, markups or tips.Personally, I'd rather spend the money on a good all-purpose calculator app that can do more than just one basic function, but if the percent key on your calculator gives you the willies, then it might be a worthwhile purchase.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004Y21WXE 4 1309910400 94 Everyone could use a unit converter.  There are a ton of them available, both pay and free.  All in all, this app is fairly unremarkable.  The only thing that makes this one somewhat unique is that you can hide units or even entire categories if you don't need them.  Don't think you'll ever need to convert to parsecs or cubits?  You can disable them.A nice addition to this app would be the ability to add your own custom units or conversion categories.  I'd also like to see the ability to convert dBm to Watts.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0080SC22I 1 1344384000 208 Mysteryville is a fairly basic hidden-object game.  I made as far as level 4 before dying of boredom; there was only one spot-the-difference puzzle, all the rest were just finding stuff.I was unable to zoom in or move around in any of the puzzles.  Every touch on the screen counted as a mistake, regardless of what I was trying to do.Why does every house in a hidden object game look like it should be on the TV show Hoarders?  And why is it nobody in these games will ever help you unless you clean up their mess?  Just imagine if you ever had to go to the hospital. "Oh dear, you're bleeding all over the place.  Help me pick up a few things first then I'll put a bandage on that."Some of the characters are highly stereotyped, almost to the point of racism, particularly the Chinese guy in chapter 3.  "Then you dlink, blave girl."  Really?The real hidden objects in this game, however, are the hidden data mining modules.  Flurry and Google Analytics, Facebook and Twitter4j, and a boat-load of permissions, including Read Phone State and Identity, Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, and Full Internet Access.The only mystery in this app is why anyone would pay $3 for it.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007NZRKF8 3 1341619200 167 Concentrate is your basic Memory-type game using a standard 52-card deck of playing cards.  There is only one mode and only one difficulty setting.The first time I attempted to run the app on my Motorola Xoom, I got a blank screen for about 30 seconds, followed by a force close.  The app loaded successfully on the second attempt.  The game was frequently slow to respond to my screen taps and the card flip animations were often rather jerky.On my HTC Evo LTE, the app loaded correctly, though slowly, but also suffered from occasional slow response.The cards were fairly hard to read on my 4.7 inch phone, I can't imagine trying to play this on a compact phone.  The cards were quite legible on my 10 inch tablet.The app is relatively small, 1.27 MB, and while it does have Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, it does not have Internet Access or any other worrisome permissions.I give this app 3 stars, an average score, for being a perfectly average game.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0058W5D0W 4 1310601600 296 I've been wanting a cookbook for my tablet, and here comes Amazon with iCookbook as the Free App of the Day.  Alright!The app looks beautiful on the Xoom.  Large, colorful pictures and an excellent layout.  The text is extremely easy to read, and in Prepare mode, is easily readable from across the kitchen.  The photos make everything look absolutely delicious and I'm looking forward to trying some of these recipes.Alas, the app doesn't appear to do so well on phones.  On my Evo 3D, the app title appeared as "kbook" the first time it started.  The text is small, but mostly readable unless you have vision problems.  The Evo has a large screen, however, on smaller phones the text is probably illegible to everyone. (Pro tip:  Hit the Prepare button to display the directions in a larger font.)The recipes appear to all be the free recipes that companies give out on their websites or the backs of products (e.g., 1/2 cup SKIPPY CREAMY or SUPER CHUNK Peanut Butter), but of course you can just use whatever brands you want.  The developer of this app also publishes a large number of dead tree cookbooks, most of which are co-branded (e.g., Campbell's 1-2-3 Dinner and Reynolds Incredibly Easy Cooking with Foil).While the app includes a conversion chart and substitution list, it would be nice to see those things actually integrated into the recipe.  I'd also like to have the ability to scale recipes (trying to remember to double everything in your head leads to mistakes, it would be much easier to see the correct amounts in the recipe).$4.99 seems a wee bit high at first, especially considering the source of the recipes.  But a comparable physical cookbook would cost around $10-15, so it's actually probably worth the money.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005Z4BGY0 5 1332288000 186 With so many copycat games out there, it's refreshing when a developer comes up with something new.The game starts out as a typical "find the hidden objects in the scene" type of game, in which you search through a room looking for fragments of music.  Some objects need to be opened, turned or reassembled to find a piece.  Once you find all the fragments of a song, it switches to puzzle mode.  It's similar to other puzzle games, fit the pieces into the frame, but with a very unique twist: each piece has symbols representing musical notes.  You can't just toss the pieces in randomly, they have to fit together AND create a melody.  Each puzzle completed adds another musical fragment or a key that unlocks a new room to explore.This game does not require the ability to read music and most of the songs should be familiar to most players.  And in case you don't recognize a song, there is an option to listen to the lead melody.  There is also a hint option that will grey out any pieces that have been placed incorrectly.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007NACZPI 1 1332460800 239 Setting aside the fact that this game has in app purchasing, which for a pay game alone makes it worthy of a zero-star rating, its just a really bad game overall.On my Motorola Xoom, the game is extremely sluggish, sometimes taking a couple seconds to respond to screen taps.  It also takes 25 to 30 seconds to load.The game REQUIRES an internet connection?  How much of my data plan is this going to eat up?The third task you're assigned after starting the game is to quarry rocks.  Unless you want to spend 12 crystals (i.e., $1.20), you MUST wait for nearly two hours AND YOU CANNOT DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME UNTIL THE TASK IS COMPLETE.  What is the point of a game you cannot play except every few hours?  At least gametime passes while the game isn't running, so you don't have to leave your phone/tablet running all the time.The game didn't exit when I told it to exit.  Watchdog reported it was still running with foreground priority.  I can understand some apps remaining in memory and dropping to standby, consuming no CPU time, that's normal for Android, but staying active and consuming processor power after I exit is unacceptable.  I had to kill the app manually.If you want a game you can't actually play, save your money and get the free gameGodville.  Then you can at least feel like you're accomplishing something while you do nothing.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007V4X5MS 4 1337644800 188 This app is a fairly basic coloring book-type app.  You're given a selection of 41 colors to choose from (scroll sideways to see them all), as well as a selections of stickers.  There is also an eraser, and options to change the brush size and opacity.  There are coloring pages for each letter of the alphabet, plus an option to start with a blank white or black canvas.  Drawings are saved automatically when exiting, though that option can be disabled in settings.  Saved drawings can be reopened from the gallery.The app is simple enough for a young child to use, but it also has features an older child might appreciate, such as adjustable opacity.The controls seem a bit small on my Motorola Xoom tablet, but just right on my HTC Evo 3D.  It's much easier to draw on the tablet, however.There is one major bug in this app: if you touch the screen with more than one finger (or accidentally brush it with your thumb, palm or whatever while drawing), the app force closes.  If this happens, the drawing is not saved and all your work is lost.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0058P7KUA 4 1310083200 142 It took several attempts to get the game to start.  The first several times I got a black screen for about 15 seconds, then it dumped me back on the home screen.  It finally worked the fourth or fifth time I started it.  I think that stupid OpenFient may be to blame.  If it doesn't start, try it again four or five times before you give up.Once I was able to get the game to start, it's pretty fun.  It's a dual-joystick game like the previous Free App of the Day PewPew 2; you move with one joystick and aim with the other.  You can move in one direction while firing in another.  You move around avoiding the zombies while blowing them away with your pistol, grenades or various powerup weapons like a shotgun or buzzsaw.Works well on the Motorola Xoom tablet.
A10GLVITSITGSA B00885MDHM 1 1343779200 222 Cross Fingers is a tangram-style puzzle game.  You have to slide pieces around the game board so that they fit together to form a shape.  Most pieces stay where you put them, but the red ones will move back so you have to hold them in place with a finger.The pieces didn't track my finger very well; on the more complex puzzles this frequently caused other pieces to be knocked out of place. -1 star for this.When you open the app, you are immediately slapped in the face with a full-screen advertisement for a bunch of different games.  There were so many game ads, you actually have to scroll down to view them all!  At the bottom of the screen is a small button you have to press to open the game.  This comes up EVERY SINGLE TIME you start the game!  Even free apps aren't usually this obnoxious with their ads.  -3 stars for this.The game also has an absurd number of permissions, the most worrisome of which are Full Internet Access, Modify/Delete SD Card Contents, and Read Phone State and Identity.  The game doesn't need any of this, and a malicious app with these permissions could be used to collect information from you or even steal files from your SD card such as photographs or documents.  -2 stars for this.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0089ZM1GY 1 1341446400 330 In Rope Rescue, you have to save your fellow birds by dragging a rope around a number of pulleys, avoiding knives, fire and other obstacles, and connecting to a hook on a cage.  The shorter the length of rope, the more points and the more feathers you are awarded.  Occasionally, you'll have the opportunity to release a butterfly.  These are used to unlock a level or obtain a hint or extra time.  You can also get a butterfly for every 25 feathers, or buy them with real money using In-App Purchasing.Originally I wasn't going to dock this game because the IAP didn't appear to be too necessary, but then I did some counting.  You can only obtain a maximum of 30 butterflies in the game: 3 you start with, 10 if you get at least 250 of the 252 available feathers, and 17 if you can release all the butterflies in each level.  It takes 30 butterflies to unlock the Infinity Hall world, which means you have to complete nearly every single level with a perfect score AND you cannot use any butterflies anywhere else in the game, otherwise, you'll only be able to play the final level by paying cash for it.[EDIT:  My bad, there are 31 butterflies available in the game, I missed one while counting the releasable butterflies (18, not 17).  But this still is an awfully slim margin, you either can use one hint and then have to complete nearly every level with a perfect score, or you can play without hints and can afford to miss an average of just 4-1/2 feathers per world.  Use two hints and you will HAVE to pay if you want to unlock the final world.]I feel this takes the app out of the realm of acceptable IAP and drops it squarely into evil.  At $2.99, the app is already pushing the boundaries of price, adding a virtually required IAP is just a slap in the face to the consumer.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006WFM7U8 3 1335312000 111 The graphics are very simple and blocky.  Controlling the Kokabot is extremely annoying; it's very hard to get it to go where you want it to.  The game was fairly fun until level 14, when you now have to maneuver your difficult-to-control Kokabot through a maze, grabbing stars while a wall moves across the screen.  If you're too slow, take the wrong path, or the Kokabot decides to go it's own way, as it is wont to do, you'll miss a few stars and have to start the level over from the beginning.  The music just keeps looping over and over and over.Why does this app require Full Internet Access permissions?
A10GLVITSITGSA B0055S348W 4 1316131200 436 I've been looking for an app that would let me print from my tablet.  I have software that can draw pictures, edit photos, receive e-mail, view web pages, and compose Office documents, but until now, I had to transfer these files to my PC to print them.My printer is an HP Officejet Pro L7650, which has both a network connection and Bluetooth.  The help docs for this app claim this is a supported printer.  I tested this app on a Motorola Xoom tablet and an HTC Evo 3D.Connecting the printer using WiFi was relatively painless and I was able to print a test document with no problems.  But when I tried connecting to the printer using Bluetooth, the printer would crash every time I tried to print.  I've printed to this printer using Bluetooth before, so I know it works.  When the printer crashed, PrinterShare would hang and I had to kill the app and restart it.I tried printing a couple documents containing embedded fonts and several images.  The result didn't look right; the fonts were all wrong, some of the images were cut off on the bottom and the text ran over the images.  Drawings came out fairly well, as did a photo; odd-sized images end up cropped, however.  Web pages print correctly if you print them from the browser, but if you try printing a web page from the app (by pressing the Web Pages button), they come out blank every time.  Calendar items printed out well, as did Contacts, though the latter was printed with rather large 16 and 20 point type.  The app can print Gmail messages (which it did well, including images), but it's unable to print messages from other e-mail programs.  I tried printing a document from Google Docs, but it failed with "PDF render error 11" when I tried it from my tablet.This software is able to print other things besides just the buttons in the app.  Any app which has a "share" button can send data to PrinterShare to be printed, so you can print Tweets, grocery lists from Might Grocery, addresses from Yelp, translations from Google Translate, results from Speed Test, passages from YouVersion's Bible app, stories from USA Today, etc.  Each app sends data differently, so your mileage may vary.I docked the app one star because it crashes a supposedly supported printer and the app hangs if there is a problem during printing.  I would dock it another star because of the problems I encountered with printing various types of files, but this was offset with an additional star because it can print from other apps.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004GYOQ6A 3 1309564800 154 I'm not a huge fan of the labyrinth type of game, and this is one of the less well polished versions I've tried. The graphics are quite mediocre. The ball seemed to want to catch and get hung up on everything. Many of the mazes have openings that are just a wee bit too small to get the ball through, so you have to figure out the proper path in addition to avoiding the pitfalls. Most annoying however are the moving sections, which can make the difference between finishing in a few seconds and taking a minute or more to finish.The app also has OpenFeint, for those of you who don't like being spied on.I think $4 is far too much for this game. $2 would be a more reasonable price, if it were a bit more polished. In its current state, 99 cents would be appropriate.Works on the Evo 3D and the Xoom.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0074AKEDC 2 1338940800 281 I think the developers have come up with a totally new kind of game. Instead of finding hidden objects, you have to find tiny pieces of objects. I guess the island's residents are prone to fits of rage where they smash everything in sight.  This is a bit scary, as there are also guns and knives scattered everywhere as well.  You could be an innocent tourist and suddenly everyone goes Landru on you.The game can be rather frustrating to learn. Some pieces that you need won't be revealed until you have gathered items from other locations, which means you end up wasting time trying to find items that simply aren't there.Frequently the pieces are very well camouflaged, making it nearly impossible to see them without resorting to using hints or random tapping. But even tapping on a piece doesn't always work. In several instances I tapped what looked like an obvious piece, sometimes several times, to no avail; after using a hint, it revealed that I was indeed in the right spot.All the characters in the game look like they are either totally stoned, in agony, or completely insane.The description of the app claims it has OpenFient, but I can't find the button for it anywhere in the game.  However, the app still wants access to phone state and identity and the list of accounts, the same permissions OpenFient uses.The game slowed to a crawl then force closed after about 30 minutes on my Motorola Xoom. After that, I was unable to restart the game without it immediately crashing until I rebooted my tablet. All progress I'd made on that level was lost and I was forced to start it over.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004LZF2LW 5 1333324800 308 This is a great app for people who travel a lot or who deal with clients/coworkers/relatives/etc in a number of different time zones.  Not only does it show the time for just about any location on Earth, it also shows whether it is today, yesterday or tomorrow there and whether it is day or night in that particular city.  You can also advance the time so that you can find out, for instance, what your local time will be when it's noon in London.The app also has a world map (or optionally, a globe) which shows all the areas of the world that have the currently selected timezone.  It also shows the areas of day and night in real time.  The default is a plain green and blue map, but there is an optional satellite map available for download.The widgets work very well on my Motorola Xoom tablet, adequately on my Evo 3D phone.  One thing I would like to see is the ability to select which specific time zones are displayed on the widgets, as well as a 1x1 widget for a single, specific time zone.I might have given this app only 4 stars, but then I discovered, buried within the settings, that the developer explains in great detail what EACH AND EVERY permission is for!  (It's in Settings --> About PolyClock --> Permissions)  I have never seen a developer offer this much information about why an app asks for particular permissions.  I would give this app 6 stars if I could just because of this.(For those who were wondering, the Fine (GPS) Location permission is for finding your current time zone in situations when your network location isn't available (and this can be disabled), while the Internet Access permission is for looking up locations not in the internal database and for downloading the optional satellite map.)
A10GLVITSITGSA B004X1TJQI 3 1314748800 197 This could be a decent tower defense game, but it's still lacking in several areas.There's no tutorial or any explanation of what each unit or upgrade does, aside from a brief description of the characters if you bothered to press the "The Family" link before playing.  Alas, it's the third option, which most people won't click first.The graphics are mediocre at best, particularly weapon effects.  The flying cookware looked especially hokey.Using identifiable, named characters as towers is a great idea, but that also means there should be more back story.  Who are these rednecks, why are they in the swamp, and where are these monsters coming from?The biggest flaw with the game is the upgrades are way too expensive.  It also appears that monster cash values don't scale with level like most TD games.  When it takes an entire level AT LEVEL 60 to accumulate enough money to do a single lowest-level upgrade to the weakest unit, you've made the game much too hard.If you're looking to spend 99 cents on a tower defense game, I'd recommend Guns'n'Glory (a former Free App of the Day) over this one.  Or get GRave Defense HD while it's on sale.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004R49A4W 5 1335398400 229 I was thinking of buying this app, and here Amazon provides it as the Free App of the Day.  Lucked out there.There is so much information in this app it can be overwhelming if you just try to browse through all the lists.  There are nearly 800 species included, so trying to flip through them as you would the pages of a book is just too much.  Fortunately, this app has an easier way.  Unlike a printed field guide, you can perform advanced searches, including information such as shape, size, color, habitat, location and time of year.The biggest advantage this app has over the book is the bird songs.  This app has thousands of songs and calls available, so not only can you see what the bird looks like, but you can hear it as well.The app also lets you keep a life list, record sightings and take photos, and then upload them to AudubonGuides.com.Because of the huge volume of data available, this app does require a data connection or a 500 MB optional download.  If you choose not to download the data, it could chew up considerable bandwidth if you have a limited data plan.My one complaint about the app is that it can't make up its mind whether it wants to run as portrait or landscape.  It keeps switching back and forth, which is a bit annoying.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004LZFWJO 1 1319846400 192 This app clearly isn't designed for high resolution displays.  On my Evo 3D, the game filled only a fraction of the screen, while on my Xoom tablet, it did fill the screen but the candy pieces were tiny, smaller than my pinky-nail, and very far apart.  The small pieces made the game much more difficult: on the Evo I couldn't see what was under my fingers, while on the Xoom it's impossible to scan the whole board at a glance.Several times while playing it would highlight a piece clear across the board with no obvious connection to where I was swiping; while I appreciate the extra points, this is obviously a bug.Gameplay is simple, yet rather addictive.  It's hard to force yourself to quit in the middle of the game.  Alas, while the game can go on for a very long time, there's no way to save your place, so if you're forced to switch away from the app, you'll lose all your progress and have to start over.While it's a decent, though not at all spectacular, time killer game, the $3 price tag is about three times what it should be.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006C8EVHM 3 1342051200 183 Word Shaker is your typical Boggle-type game with a small twist, you can shake your device to scramble the letters if you're having trouble finding anything.  You can play with the basic 4x4 board or up to a monstrous 8x8 board, and you can choose a time limit from 1 to 10 minutes or infinite.Overall the game is quite fun.  I like having the option to select an unlimited amount of time so I can try to find the really big words.  I did have an occasional frustrating issue where the game wouldn't quite track my finger correctly, wasting precious seconds during a time limited game; this was particularly bad on my HTC Evo LTE.  -1 star for this.The text-to-speech function doesn't work on the Motorola Xoom with ICS.  Selecting it just brings up a menu to install foreign language packs; even if you select all three it still won't work.  (Text-to-speech works fine in other apps.)This app calls on the Control Vibrator, View Network State and Full Internet Access permissions.  It contains modules from Madvertise and Flurry Analytics.  -1 star for this.
A10GLVITSITGSA B008194C74 5 1337904000 180 This app is one of the more unique games I've seen in a while.  You are given a number of crossword-style clues but instead of merely typing in the answers, you have to locate them within a famous quotation.There are a number of errors in the description for this app.  It's not free, but you also get a lot more than just 24 puzzles (it currently offers 84).  New puzzles appear to be free, as there is no mention of in-app purchasing and the "Funny Stuff" puzzle pack that is shown as $0.99 in the product images is included free with this app.  Best of all, however, is that despite a massive list of permissions shown on the website, when you install the app no permissions are required at all!There is no time limit in the game, so relax, no need to rush.  If you can't figure out a clue, skip it and move on; you can come back after you've eliminated some of the letters from the quote.This game is loads of fun and definitely worth the 99 cents.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004R7C0QY 4 1336780800 375 I received Audubon Birds as Free App of the Day, which lead me to buying the Flower, Tree and Butterfly Guides as well, and all of these were great, so I decided to go ahead and round out my collection with the remaining Audubon Guide apps while there were still on sale.Mammals is the smallest of the Audubon apps, with a mere 283 entries.  Downloading the entire database is only 59 MB, so unless you don't have an SD card or are critically low on space, it's well worth the download.  (If you don't download the database, you will consume bandwidth every time you use the app, which could be a problem if you have a limited data plan.)This is also the easiest to use of the Audubon apps.  While a novice might have no clue where to even begin with mushrooms or butterflies, most people know at least what general sort of mammal they are looking at (e.g., that's a bear, that's a squirrel, that's a raccoon, etc).The app has an advanced search function, but it has only 5 parameters: shape, habitat, region, color and size.  This is fine for most of the smaller families, but woefully inadequate for the large families of Rodentia or Lagomorpha.This app lumps the pikas in with voles, lemmings and pocket gophers, even though they are more closely related to rabbits.  That is because their appearance is more vole-like than rabbit-like.Some of the animals have sound files, but a great many do not.  The app could also use more photos of animals in the larger families, as it can be difficult to tell the difference between various rabbits, for instance, based on a single photo.Many of the entries have drawings of droppings, nests, paw or hoof prints, and various other identifying signs, a feature not found in any of the other Audubon Guide apps.Like the other Audubon apps, this app lets you keep a life list, record sightings and take photos, and then upload them to AudubonGuides.com.This app crashes frequently when starting up, but it will start successfully on the second attempt.  This occurs with both my Motorola Xoom tablet and my HTC Evo 3D phone.On my tablet, the app constantly switches back and forth between portrait and landscape.
A10GLVITSITGSA B0071PS7AC 1 1330992000 42 TEN gutters balls and a final score of 43 the first time I played this game.  I did much than that the first time I bowled in real life. Even the computer player had two gutter balls!  Awful controls make winning impossible.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005SJTLUS 3 1322524800 66 They fixed the volume in an update.  I raised by rating from 1 to 3 stars.Original review:Permissions aside, it's an OK game. I'm not a big Serious Sam fan, but this game is almost completely unlike Serious Sam.My biggest complaint, and one that sends this game from 3 stars to 0, is that your volume choices are mute or full-blast.  This is absolutely unacceptable to me.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004FOA84A 4 1303344000 206 There was an update for this app today and they appear to have fixed the Force Close issue that was plaguing the Xoom and the Evo (and possibly other devices).  I am revising my review from 1 star to 4.The game is a point-and-click style adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis or Maniac Mansion.  You explore the manor, picking up assorted objects and clues to solve various puzzles.  These puzzles can open new rooms or provide pieces to still other puzzles.The game took me about 1 hour to finish, though this sort of game is old-hat for me.  Some of the puzzles were quite difficult, particularly figuring out the proper color sequence (if you play the game, you'll know what I mean).  Unfortunately, the game doesn't appear to have much replayability, since the puzzles are always the same.Is the game worth $1.99?  I'm not sure.  I got an hour's worth of brain-wracking enjoyment out of it.  That's slightly more per hour than a DVD rental, but cheaper than theatre or movie tickets.Old review:1 starForce closes immediately on my Motorola Xoom. And from reading other reviews, it appears the Xoom isn't the only device having this issue. Glad it was free.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004N2NWT2 2 1303257600 43 After an update, it works correctly on the Xoom.  Still sucks, though.ORIGINAL REVIEW:It doesn't work on the Motorola Xoom.  Only a moron would code an app so that it won't work on a higher resolution screen.  Get a brain, morans, and fix it.
A10GLVITSITGSA B005XQLBU4 3 1326585600 181 I keep seeing a lot of reviews that this game is "repetitive".  Have none of you people ever actually played Missile Command?  Of course it's repetitive, all 80's video games were repetitive.I like the fact that you can upgrade your missiles and that you can rebuild your cities quickly if they're damaged or destroyed.  I'm extremely disappointed that you can't chain explosions like you could in Missile Command (i.e., you shoot one missile, it creates a large explosion, which can destroy other missiles which create explosions, which can destroy more missiles, etc).There seemed to be some anomalies in targeting.  I'd tap the screen and a target marker would appear, but the missiles would sometimes explode someplace else.  This proved fatal in higher levels because there's no time to shoot again.The game also kept running and making noise after I pressed the home key upon finishing a game.  It took me a bit to figure out why I was hearing birds every so often.  Watchdog showed it still running in the background.  I tried to reproduce this, but it didn't happen again.
A10GLVITSITGSA B004XDYJRU 1 1303430400 271 This is really a great little app.  It has nearly all the local AM and FM radio stations here in Nebraska, as well as NOAA weather radio and the Lincoln and Omaha police and fire departments.  Plus I can listen to radio stations in other states or even other countries.A word of caution: sign up for a RadioTime account BEFORE you start setting up presets in this app, because once you sign in, it will delete all your presets without warning and replace them with the presets from your RadioTime account.EDIT:  RadioTime is now TuneIn.  The updated version of the app now has a sign-in for a TuneIn account, rather than a RadioTime account.  They're the same thing, just a new name.SECOND EDIT: Supposedly the latest version of this app will no longer delete existing presets when you sign in to your TuneIn account.  I'd still play it safe and sign up for an account first.EDIT THE THIRD:  When I updated this app this morning, I discovered they have added new permissions.  They now want to read your contacts and use accounts on this device.  These are apparently for a new social media feature that is completely useless.  The new user interface is extremely confusing and poorly designed.  To access your favorite stations, for instance, you now have to press the tiny button labeled "My profile".  If you put it in car mode, your favorites are now under "Follows".  Yeah, that's totally obvious.  I can no longer give this app 5 stars, I'm dropping it down to just one.  It's just an awful app now.  Social media killed the radio star.
A10GLVITSITGSA B007JM4CWY 5 1337731200 409 CrossMe is a type of Japanese logic puzzle called a nonogram.  You are shown a grid surrounded by numbers, which represent the number of consecutive squares in that particular row or column which much be filled in.  For instance, "5" would mean that you have to fill in 5 squares all next to one another, while "3 4" means there are 3 filled squares, followed by an unknown number of blank spaces, then 4 more filled squares.  Filling in all the appropriate squares will reveal a picture.The game can look very intimidating to the novice, but once you learn a few tricks, it becomes very simple.Step one:  Look for rows or columns that are completely filled in.  In a 10x10 puzzle, that would be a row with a "10".  Then look for rows that are completely blank.Step two:  Look for rows or columns with a number that is more than half the width of the puzzle.  For instance, in a 10x10 puzzle, a row with "6" or higher will always occupy at least a few of the squares in the middle of the row, so you can fill those in.Step three:  If you have any squares filled in along the edges, then you already know how many to fill in from that edge.  In a 10x10 puzzle, if a row is labeled as "3 4", and the first space in the row has already been filled, then the next two must be filled as well.Step four:  Fill in gaps between squares.  If a row is labeled as "4" and you have one space filled, then a blank, then another filled space, then you know the blank between the two must be filled.Step five:  If you tap on a square twice, it will place an "X" instead of filling the square.  Use these whenever possible.  If you've filled in all the appropriate spaces in a row, fill the blank squares with "X"s and it will be help you figure out the columns.  For instance, if a row is labeled "3 3" and you already have two sets of 3 squares filled in, then the rest of the squares in the row should be X'ed out.Hopefully that made sense.  Like I said before, it's a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes much easier.This game works perfectly on my Motorola Xoom tablet.  My only complaint is that the price, $4.95, feels a bit high.
A10GLVITSITGSA B006VLNIFQ 3 1335571200 56 The opening screens make it look like the game is about a guy leaping around on top of poles like some kind of awesome chopsocky film, but when it actually starts, it's just tapping on wooden circles falling from the top of the screen.  It's like Tetris, but without the fun of stacking the falling pieces.
A10GMU2T2XVQI5 B00FVVR2ZO 4 1402358400 25 I like this type of hidden object game.  The quest keep you going. I like ones where you don't have to decorate to level up.
A10GMU2T2XVQI5 B00E8KLWB4 4 1397433600 26 So far the game is pretty good. Only level four. Hope there are not quest in the future that can't be completed without friends or money.
A10GMU2T2XVQI5 B00CNT8KW6 5 1380499200 20 Good slot game. Only two games unlocked so far but I really like it. Great way to past the time.
A10GR3U6ACROPF B00AREIAI8 5 1362873600 20 This app is so fun I love it you can choose different horses and land  !!!!! And I love horse's!!!!!
A10GR3U6ACROPF B00C6SFRMA 5 1374537600 27 I lllllllllllloooooooooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeeeee this game it is so fun. So many different themes and subject.  My mom and I love this game it is so much fun .

A10GR3U6ACROPF B00A3WTXQ2 5 1362700800 24 Just cause it looks weird it so fun and it is and a time waster ! And when I'm board I play this game
A10GUHRNZV5C4P B009UX2YAC 2 1361404800 67 Loved this App the first month I had it. It is highly addictive and rewarding to unlock new characters and items. Then one day I went to use it and my high score was there but nothing else including my in-app purchases. It's lots of fun but don't get too attached to it. Like many other reviewerss on here, my Kindle version crashed too and reset everything.
A10GUHRNZV5C4P B009O5CLZY 5 1396915200 32 Love this app and so do my kids. Simple concept with fun challenges give this game lots of replay value. All the great reviews of this game are right on the money.
A10GVQPEKFD1V B004UCO0FA 5 1395100800 79 KJV version which is the most beautiful and the most accurate, study the history of how the King James Bible came about, no need for wi fi once it is installed on the device it opens and makes it real nice to take to church to follow along with the preacher, you can find the scriptures fast, just make sure the text to speech is off so it does not go off during the sermon, which happened to me.
A10GVQPEKFD1V B00FS0VUWO 1 1395100800 20 you can only fly a few planes then you have to pay to fly all the other planes and missions
A10GVZIVH9CEY7 B00IZMQ8G0 4 1396483200 35 My son downloaded the game for himself but it's me that's constantly playing it. Try it once and you'd be hooked. Great game.  A lot of questions get difficult as u get farther into game.
A10GVZIVH9CEY7 B00FXKHEK6 3 1384300800 25 This game is great for the kids on those long car rides. Surprisingly I even enjoyed playing. I knew more characters than the kids did.
A10GVZIVH9CEY7 B00FEMJF6O 3 1392508800 26 I saw my niece playing game and only downloaded it because she needed extra friends to get points. Now she has deleted game and I'm addicted.
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B004SCQABY 5 1331337600 24 A great, addictive app, with great graphics. Ive had this app for awhile, And it truly never gets old. Totally worth the three dollars.
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B0067Q42BY 5 1329609600 29 This is a great app, its fun, a time waster and is still intellectual! I love that it has a storyline, along with short comic strips. Totally worth it!
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B009G1J62C 5 1351987200 39 I love this game sooooo much!  You can ride, fly, float, or can do all of them to get to the finish.  I love how there are levels where you can make any vehicle you want.  Totally worth 3$.
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B0071PARPA 5 1333238400 37 I've seen a lot of drawing apps that are pretty stinky!! But for this being a free app, its really cool!!! Lots of brushes to choose from, and tons of colors.  This app is a must get.
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B0064DBE9I 5 1340755200 33 Being a piano player myself, I had a lot of fun playing this app.  I really love how you can choose different instruments to play.  For being free, this app is definetly awesome!
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B0066W1AZK 5 1341705600 20 The computers surprised me at how well they played.  Great way to improve your skills.  Would recommend it to anybody.
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B006D1ONE4 5 1333411200 53 This is a great game that's super addictive, and fun to play.  This is pretty much the most fun game since angry birds. The only thing that I have to say about it is that I wish I would have gotten it as the free app of the day, because, you know, discount!!!!
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B004T2QZL8 5 1332201600 61 I don't know why people are giving this game bad reviews.  Its such a fun game, and on the kindle, I haven't experienced any glitches.  Ive played this game before on the Internet, and I loved it, and now to have it on the kindle is just wonderful.  Great graphics, fun yet challenging, everything you would want an app to be!!!!
A10GX0AJCMZFTD B005V1N71W 5 1343260800 61 Thanks to Pandora, I have been introduced to a whole new world of music!  It takes what songs you've liked, then finds other similar songs.  I've found so many great songs due to this app.  I don't know why people are saying that it forces closed, this hasn't ever happend to me and I've had the app for a while now.

A10GX5A4J1OTNG B009KS4XRO 2 1364515200 24 It was okay, but after a few times, no longer allowed to use unless I spent for more of something. Did not want to.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B006PJ3UKC 5 1357948800 61 i read this every evening and it is a great paper and as my local paper is going to three days a week USA Today will become my &#34;go-to&#34; paper for everything. Right now it is the only place where I get all of the National and World news. Great paper. Wish they had comics and my day would be complete.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B008CGZZHW 5 1357948800 39 One of my favorite games on my kindle. Play it all the time. It is easy and follows the actual rules of Yatzy. Great game to relax you after a long day or to amuse you on any day.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B0098LBZPG 2 1364515200 30 Just cannot get it to open or work. Am going to remove from my inventory. If I can't play it do not want it taking up room on my Kindle.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B004HE5TAG 4 1357948800 23 It is good and a fast moving game. Nice to pass the time. It's blackjack. The game is good and easy to play.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B0087SGWI6 5 1357948800 43 Being 77 years old, I find each of these games to be great for keeping my mind functioning properly and a way to find out if I am slowing down or not. Would recommend to anyone who wants to keep their mind sharp.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B0066T8SDU 5 1357948800 41 This is a great game, the screen is large enough to make it easy to play and word games are just great for keeping your mind going and working at full speed. Play one or two games most evenings. Love it!
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B009WJNXAE 5 1364515200 43 It allows me to play every day and I can buy additional time if I want, but I DO NOT HAVE TO! Love that I am given the option of buying more or not and am still allowed to play once a day.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B00IS87HYI 4 1402617600 63 It is a cute game but you run out of energy or power too soon and can't continue on. So I redo the levels I've done and stop when I reach the money needed level. But a cute game. Would love them to come out with one of these that is really free so you have a chance of seeing the final levels.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B004SJ3204 4 1357948800 32 Like the game and it follows the rules of cribbage. Wish I could select my players color, etc., but that is minor. The game flows and moves along at a good pace,
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B0064TVQ5E 4 1360627200 32 The tiles are a good size. Would like them a tad bigger, but game is easy and it is good training to keep the eye and brain working together. Play it often.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B008JJS6D2 4 1357948800 38 Good game, but slow moving so only play for a short time. It should be speeded up and the cards are really small. They could be larger and make it easier to play. But overall, it is Bingo.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B0067Q4DPE 1 1357948800 53 I have tried to play this several times. Need to remove as I cannot open it. It keeps wanting me to buy screens. And I have not once been able to start the game and do not want to buy any other layout until I am able to at least play the game.
A10GX5A4J1OTNG B0063IH60K 5 1357948800 30 Fast moving and the ads are not intrusive, you just skip them and get on with your game. Play it almost every night. Very relaxing and easy game to play.
A10GZKZ9022JSV B009HN0V6E 5 1388880000 43 Now I have budder armor without mining budder ore!!!! &amp; I have 64 Diamond swords,&amp; infinite food without farming carrots,potatoes,&amp; beet-roots! Also I can turn it to night &amp; day without writing a hexadecimal digit on the PC! WORTH IT!!!  :)  -Rebecca Brown
A10GZKZ9022JSV B00DGMVC4C 5 1402876800 86 This is similar to Zuma's Revenge, but different,too. I love the powerhouse,they're awesome!The music,I Don't have many words to describe it. . Beautiful. Marvellous.I love the surroundings,they give me a warm feeling. There are so much levels. I can't believe some people can make a huge game! I couldn't think of any other marble game better than this.(Besides Luxor &amp; Luxor:Amun Rising)People who don't have this app,This game is totally worth the $5.00 you pay.Definitely a game kids should play.GET IT NOW!!!!!BEST MARBLE GAME CREATED!!!!! :D
A10GZKZ9022JSV B00BXTTRO2 2 1388880000 36 I was downloading mods, &amp; when I enabled one, it crashed.Please fix these crashes! &amp; I can't download Texture packs for some reason! Please Fix this stuff &amp; maybe next time I might rate this better!
A10GZKZ9022JSV B007SYWFRM 5 1388966400 29 I would rate this 1,000,000,000,000,000 out of 10. &amp; Yes .It is that good.Also, there are some bugs please fix them.Then I would rate it Infinity out of 10
A10H1E6QGHM3UZ B0071Q75AO 2 1331510400 26 this app is based on heat of finger. so don't bother. my little cousin didn't even know half the words it told her. stupid and boring.
A10H1E6QGHM3UZ B0058KGXXU 5 1340236800 20 I really like this game!!!!! its fun and creative! me and all my friends love this game! get it now!!
A10H1VYCC4LQPL B00COVCV50 5 1371254400 69 this is a really great game. I'm quite enjoying it :) it's not too easy, but not too hard. good job epic pixel llc!  uh oh still need more words for this... how many words do these people expect you to put? sheesh &gt;_&lt; cause it totally takes 20 + words for a review...... yeah... I'm sure.... it still says I don't have enough... how is that possible? ugh!!
A10H1VYCC4LQPL B00CEBO09A 5 1371340800 27 this is a pretty fun game. mildly entertaining with it's antics and funny sounds. can be a bit annoying, but other tyrant that it's a decent game.
A10H1VYCC4LQPL B00AA87JGU 5 1365552000 23 fun game! just as good as 100 floors! :) I have had a great time playing it! some of them are pretty challenging!
A10H52874HQ6HH B004FRX0MY 5 1402790400 25 This is a nice addition to all of the other services that Amazon provides to Prime subscribers.  I recommend it for anyone who loves music...
A10H52874HQ6HH B0063GORYU 5 1378252800 29 My wife drives me crazy trying to exceed her last point level while we are traveling of just relaxing.  It works really well on our Samsung Galaxy S4 phones.
A10H52874HQ6HH B004MC0FO8 5 1379289600 24 This is a most amazing app to use to identify and then buy a song, if you desire it.  It is quick and accurate.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B0055SWM08 4 1354579200 51 This is a beautiful maze game with incredible depth in levels and difficulty.  The soundtrack may get a little tinkly after looping over and over as one tries to solve a maze, and the stellar graphics mean that the game can cause a huge battery drain.  However, still an excellent app.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B00FGFVMGA 5 1388620800 71 I still enjoy playing The Lost City and so I purchased Mosaika for more of the same.  Mosaika might have a slight edge over The Lost City as I found a few of the puzzle solutions slightly less obvious.  Mosaika, like The Lost City, has neat world-building, interesting puzzles to fit into the storyline, is lovely to look at, with similar music, and, if I had to gripe, could be longer.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B004FOA84A 3 1388620800 167 The Secret of Grisly Manor is a nice little puzzle game in line with the other two FMG games I have, Adventures of Mosaika and The Lost City.  However, Grisly Manor seems more like a prototype rather than a fully formed game and features present in the subsequent games are sorely missed here.  The Journal is particular, which saves a great deal of time retracing the path back to previously-explored rooms to review clues to puzzles.  On the other hand, perhaps that was deliberate in order to artificially inflate the amount of time it takes to solve the game.  Because as short as Mosaika and Lost City are, Grisly is practically a blip.  The puzzle solutions in Grisly weren't as involved either, which is troubling as the other games are not exactly complex.  The Secret of Grisly Manor has atmosphere in its graphics and sound, but as a puzzle game, while acceptable, it doesn't compare to the rest of Fire Maple Games' offerings, even at 99 cents.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B0085P2Z6E 2 1388620800 263 At first, this hidden object game seemed better than most.  It had plenty of levels [21 if I recall] and a coherent storyline [find your missing sister in a magical castle by questioning the teachers, who will help you if you help them].  The objects to be found or cleared away made some sort of sense in the context of the story, rather than some hidden object games which has one searching for an elephant in a library.  However, a higher level didn't translate to an increase in complexity to the puzzle.  Either the gamer is tasked to find a number of the same object [such as scrolls, or capturing escaped bugs] or clear away 'junk' objects to clean a place up.  The junk objects were repeated in the levels as well, which became old quickly.  Any tap on the screen, no matter the circumstances, was a penalty if it didn't land on an object.  For example, one twist at some stages was performing the task in the dark; unfortunately, tapping the screen to light the 'torch' [which was necessary to see anything] counted as a 'find' tap.  The game has a load of unavoidable dialogue and the gamer [who is always called Irene btw] revisits the same teachers several times.  Very tedious.  The graphic depictions of the academy and characters were clearly copied from movie-Harry Potter and quite a few [renamed] characters make an appearance, such as Dumbledore, Snape, Flitwick, Sprout, and Harry himself.  In the end the game was not interesting enough to me enough to keep it on my phone.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B00HLT6JQM 4 1394496000 113 Cryptic Kingdoms closely resembles Fire Maple Games' offerings; since I like FMG, this is a good thing.  There is a good storyline, multiple 'worlds', a journal (although not as thorough as the one used in FMG), and a map.  The puzzles in Cryptic Kingdoms, many based on colors and shapes, can get a bit illogical (in my opinion) but there is nothing too frustrating or impossible; others lean toward the obvious.  Hints are available but I didn't need to consult them to solve the problems.  The background music did not vary and annoyed me after a while, but there is an option to shut it off.  All in all, a very good time-waster.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B004J1AYW0 4 1334016000 42 I tend to play it before a movie starts, which is just long enough to get a few rounds in before I get bored by watching the flipping chips.  There isn't much variety obviously.  The game works very well on my Rezound.
A10H9DKSXJJ03Y B005Z4BGY0 4 1334016000 62 I enjoyed playing Musaic quite a bit.  The musical puzzles were challenging enough and the mini-stories about each piece were cute.  The hidden object portion could get a little frustrating at times and reduce one to a mere pixel hunt.  Unfortunately, once conquered, the game is done.  I could wish for more levels or variations in the music puzzles for repeat playability.
A10HAHGT5O40IV B007N6NGYG 4 1364860800 78 I was hopeing to find a game like the old PC 'Railroad tycoon'This is not that type of game.  I have not found much interest in it.This is given a better rating due to the fact that my girlfriend enjoys playing it, and keeps barrowing my phone to do so. We occasionally work on it together and hae fun spending the time together while doing so.(Hint: make a windows version so she can get it on her phone)
A10HAHGT5O40IV B00933JL0A 4 1364860800 175 This game is very similar to the Win 95 game 'Serf City'You build up a mideval town by bulding population and assinging them tasks. There are supply chains to consider, ie: to make bread you need a farmer harvesting wheat, a mill to turn the wheat into flower, and a baker to bake the flower into bread (the baker requires wood that is chopped down by a lumber jack).  All the people are animated - the lunber jack will go out chop down a tree and bring the wood back to his cabin, where another person will come to carry the wood to storage or where it may be needed.The bigest difference between this and 'Serf city' is there are no fuedal lords attacking you, so no warriors or guard huts / towers.  which for me I prefer, I like to focus on the building and developement, not have to worry and be distracted building a military and fighting.Be carefull, this is a time consuming game, takes a long time to build up a town.
A10HAHGT5O40IV B00ALKKM98 4 1364860800 51 Tried it, ended up playing evey spare moment I had until I had completed all the levels that came with it (well, except for the tablet levels - tried, but just too small to work on my phone).  If I get a tablet I will continue with those levels right away.
A10HFYY2XVWCUG B00BGDEK9C 5 1371340800 21 Playing this game is like real bowling. I would recommend it to all my friends the challenge is great to play
A10HFYY2XVWCUG B00GDADUPS 5 1385337600 23 I like the game it is very mind challenging and really makes you think I would recommend this game to all my friends
A10HFYY2XVWCUG B007MNV5WU 5 1363478400 22 It is so fascinating. I think I'm getting addicted to it playing with my grand Kids we are enjoying it so much
A10HFYY2XVWCUG B006VFNUEG 5 1366156800 28 I love it I can find all the news i am looking for and more i would recommend this app to all who owns a Kndle Fire HD
A10HFYY2XVWCUG B00BYJ6BUO 5 1396828800 21 I like Watch ABC it is very good for watching TV shows missed that I forgot to record. Glad I chose...
A10HKNZTZAM4TR B00HRMNKWE 3 1399593600 52 Fun but stuck in animal level 5 ?', would have to return to game for exact level .  However there are two items , cattle and pillow, that ask for.5 &amp; 7 letters but there are only several two letter blocks to work with.  So impossible to proceed further in animal category.
A10HKNZTZAM4TR B007ZGO7EM 5 1363737600 23 SHOWING the previous entry below the current one is so helpful for  my multi-tasking mode of working . It is SIMPLY PERFECT !.
A10HKNZTZAM4TR B009LQ8X58 4 1365811200 39 I knew I had file corruption, as my downloads were getting slower.  Apps weren't working right.  The outlook was bleak until I found this app.  First run corrected everything.  I run it every few days just to be sure.
A10HLDOERKJCLG B00FBOOEV6 5 1384387200 24 Excellent game - similar to Dots, but with some really nice &#34;tweaks&#34;, both in strategy and sounds.  Actually prefer it over Dots for iPad/iPhone.
A10HP88FKBIOB7 B00CRLSN4U 4 1372464000 23 This game is awesome it is so much fun to play with friends some are hard so we have to lol it up
A10HP88FKBIOB7 B008Y7SMQU 4 1351296000 24 this is a really fun game if you like a challange you most certainly love this game and you cant go wrong with FREE!
A10HP88FKBIOB7 B008TQ16OG 1 1363305600 22 top free apps? I don't think so. I never actually played this but I really want it so make it free please!!!!
A10HRJUNUJYRR5 B007XKEZ7O 4 1344384000 68 I love the app... bbbuuuttt.. I just wish the price wasn't so high, and plus when I was searching for the app there was a free one and I got it but then I also got the $2.99 one and they were both the same thing... so I pretty much just wasted money when I could spend the money else wear.... waste of money.. get the free one..:)
A10HRJUNUJYRR5 B008PPGFZG 5 1351814400 22 I luv this app and it's my life... wish we could post pictures from the enternet... or anywhere. but I wuv it
A10HRJUNUJYRR5 B007MNV5WU 5 1333497600 27 it's something different for a change. I mean like there's nothing like it and where would you find a game like this anywhere. definitely worth $3.00. :)
A10HRJUNUJYRR5 B006D1ONE4 5 1342569600 21 its really interesting and u really have to use your brain knowledge to figure out which direction each liquid is going
A10HRJUNUJYRR5 B0058VW36U 5 1332460800 49 I love this game and I am so addicted to it:) Once you start it's like you can never stop..... I would spend $5 on this game and a dollar is worth buying this game. I would recommend buying cut the rope because you will never regret buying it.
A10HRNATKKR0YJ B008JGSM6G 5 1390867200 25 This is a fun and challenging game to play. Makes you think and leaves you wanting to do another. My granddaughter loves playing it too.
A10HRNATKKR0YJ B00B7Y0206 2 1390867200 34 Too much buffering, it takes up a lot of time and then only plays the video for a short time. I would like it for the video to play without stopping every 10 seconds.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B004HE5TAG 3 1374883200 56 This app reminded me of my favorite card game as a kid years ago. Same game but with a computer player. Not difficult and you are able to bet on the table. You can only play so many hands though until you have had enough of the game so you do get tired after so long.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B00B63HT8Q 5 1374883200 73 This weather radar comes in handy here in Missouri especially this time of year. I have compared this app to a few of our local channels and the weather channel and they are very similar and moving same directions. As far as I know this radar is good enough for me and will come in handy in case my family and I ever have to run downstair for cover again or lose power.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B00A4KVFLY 1 1374883200 46 I love the tv show family feud and when I found this game for free I was excited. So I played a bit and when I found you had to pay to play the rest of the game I was mad. What a tease! Oh well..
A10HSD6IME9JOH B007ZGO7EM 5 1374883200 23 Works Great! What else could you ask for for a free calculator. Comes in really handy too if you have a kindle fire.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B004GWRMWC 5 1374883200 63 Awesome App! Pretty Cool to just browse though if your interested in real estate through out the U.S., looking to move, or just bored and checking out cool houses. Shows pictures of property for sale and rent, cost, details and more. I have never heard of Zillow before but since this app I look all the time and they seem to update often.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B00A4EZ3QS 3 1372550400 123 This game is not to bad. I was try to find something like Candy Crush for my Kindle fire and this had the best reviews. I got into it at first. Kinda hard to figure out at first. I didnt like how your just swipeing through the entire game just with a time clock and not getting anywhere. Like with candy crush you go up levels and it gets more difficult. This game stays the same pace, same difficulty level the whole time everytime. It got old. I dont really play it anymore. I recomend it to anyone that just wants to pass time by or is bored maybe. Its not a bad game, it just not fun anymore after so many games.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B0080H2TFE 1 1374883200 50 I really tried to like this game and played several times. I just could not play any longer. At first I didnt understand, then when you get it your so wore out and bore of it that you dont want to look at all the numbers anymore. I uninstalled it.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B008JJS6D2 2 1372550400 73 This app of Bingo is good. I had no problems with it on my kindle fire. I have always been a bingo fan but there is just no excitement in this game. I got very bored pretty quick. I would have only gave it 1 star because it was such a snoozer but because it had no problems and stayed pretty much to a classic bingo game I gave it an extra star.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B004H2MGOU 1 1374883200 29 Same classic game. Can pass time by yourself but gets boring real fast. The computer player you play with makes it impossible to win, where's the fun in that?
A10HSD6IME9JOH B0094BB4TW 5 1372550400 33 This app of facebook works great on my kindle fire and I think the pictures and status' writing, ect. look just as good as if on a laptop. I dont really have complaints.
A10HSD6IME9JOH B00A757EFW 5 1372550400 62 This app is really cool. The details in the game are just like they were back in the arcades. They even created a joy stick on the screen to move the pacman around, or you can just use your finger. It is the same exact game and rules as it has always been. I recomend to anyone who has ever loved Pacman!
A10HSD6IME9JOH B007N8RULO 5 1372550400 97 I gave this game a 5 star rating because it is one of the first games I felt so addicted to I couldnt put the game away. No problems with downloading or playing the game on my Kindle fire. The only thing I dislike about this is between changing out new hands of cards to play a new game there are pop ups or ads. Other than that I would definatly recomend this game to anyone who likes to exercise there brain a little play puzzles and strategize. If you like Solitaire, you will LOVE Spider Solitaire!
A10HSD6IME9JOH B0088P2A7A 5 1374883200 36 This is one of my Go-To apps. If I dont know what something is or what it means. I go to wikipedia. You can search for the most random words, things, objects celebrities, movies & more.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B00992CF6W 4 1359244800 38 this app is awesome on my kindle!  the huge screen allows me to see more of my sorroundings and i can connect with anyone i know!  the only disclaimer&hellip; i can only connect if there is internet connection.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B0064X7FVE 5 1377561600 47 this app is great!  it allows you to view the forecast across the world, the globe, etc.  the only thing is, you cant view without wi-fi (like most apps) and its a battery hog.  However, I got a really good use out of it.  it works great!
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B00AM5JTV4 4 1359244800 35 i love quizing my roommate to see if he is a moron!  we both are witch kind of stinks because we both want to be scientists.  this is so fun... even though its dificult.  ;)
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B006VXRNYG 5 1362700800 29 my friend has this game on her ipod and i got it on my kindle.  i love how the pictures glow off the screen!  it is also really calming.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B00APKDEH6 5 1399680000 54 If you have a Tumblr blog, get this app!  It allows you to like, reblog, and post on your tablet.  You can chewing your messages, followers, and the like as well.  You can also set up an account on it!  It doesn't crash often for me.  I give it five stars for a reason.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B009UX2YAC 4 1359763200 64 i think this app is pretty good!  i love how the base of it is,1) u were doing grafiti on a subway car2) a fat police officer and his boston terrier caught u3) u have to run for ur life while doging and jumping over signs, bushes, and trains.i also think the officer needs to lay off the donuts.  hes really putting on weight.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B004UID2LC 4 1377561600 76 I am a big anime fan and this app helps me a lot.  it allows me to download music and video that is sent to my gallery on my kindle.  the only two disclaimers are that:1. you cant do anything without wi-fi2. you cant watch music videos or things by a big time artistmaybe those will work for you, I dont know.  other than that, this app is great and I highly recommend it for you!
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B004TTY694 5 1359763200 66 i gpt this app to use as a personal journal.  i activated it and i immediately started typing!  it saved my &quot;documents&quot; (thats what i call them) easily and i was able to open them backup and edit them.  i also love how i can type and it instantly fixes my mistakes!  thisis a reliable app and i totally recomend it to you.  ^.^  :)  ;)
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B0071PARPA 4 1362700800 34 im really glad this game was free.  i overall love this app, although when i go to use a drawing tool, it comes out faded.  also the advertisments are starting to drive me insane.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B009ZKSPDK 3 1383955200 30 what happened to the original minecraft?  just curious.  this is fun, a great app with a lot less bugs and lags, bur still.  I thought minecraft was the only one.
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B004K56MNU 5 1367107200 59 I love this app.  if you are looking for a writing app to share your skills with others, this is the app you should by.  not only can I check my data on the computer, but now I can do it on my kindle to!  I'm so glad Wattpad made an app!  I highly recommend this app to you!
A10HTZH1QLOFNT B0066TUXU6 1 1379808000 49 this app sucks.  if u do end up finding a video that u actually want to watch, it makes you sign in when u don't have an account.  it also lags a lot to, which drives me freaking insane.  I'm glad its free, cause' it ain't worth your while.
A10HURT1B9FM44 B0094BB4TW 3 1404864000 20 Since the update it will not  open no matter what I do I wish someone would fix it thank u
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1396396800 21 U will love it it Is the best game ever go get it now u can do any thing on it
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00EBQRSTK 5 1404172800 20 I've played many of these types of games but this one's my favorite so far. Very fun for all ages.
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00BX42FLY 5 1397520000 38 I enjoy this game a lot. Fun and challenging. Can play for a long time or a  few minutes and that's a plus for me !!  Even my kids like it so great .  We play together sometimes.
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00ABGEFWC 5 1386547200 22 This game is super fun go play it over 400pets to get us Ya Ya Ya go now good for all ages
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00HETUEFG 5 1397520000 26 LOVE this one. They range from easy to hard depending on your knowledge of the item. If you like these games this one is for you
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00FCYEZOQ 5 1394755200 22 Awesome game. Graphics could be a bit better but fun otherwise. Even my three kids enjoy it. Fun for the whole family
A10HURT1B9FM44 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383177600 22 My favorite game. LOVE it so so much. I'm hooked and so is the rest of the family.Great for all to play
A10HWQ7QGU5NET B005ZXWMUS 5 1345852800 37 I just love being able to view movies and documentries on my Kindle.  It is great when I travel long distances and need to get my mind off of the long trip, plus the selection is great.
A10HWQ7QGU5NET B00FAPF5U0 1 1393459200 62 I was not crazy about the way the game is set up.  I love the game itself, but not the way you are not allowed continuous play.  I do not like waiting a day or so to be able to be able to continue playing the game, or unless you are willing to put up cash to pay to continue the game.
A10HYIP18NQHC4 B009UWL580 4 1353715200 20 simple and easy to use. great for the little ones. fun game. have to wait awhile to get more grabs.
A10HYIP18NQHC4 B00AK0X5VQ 5 1363737600 80 I love this game! It is challenging, fun & relaxing. I play it every night before bed.  They do recommend wearing headphones while playing it and I can see why! It's like you totally submerse yourself into the game. All outside distractions are gone! I do wish they had a help or tip screen, but I usually keep trying until I get it. Even though I got it as a free app I would still spend $4-5 for this game!
A10HYIP18NQHC4 B00A4O6NMG 5 1368230400 45 Very fun game if you you don't mind waiting a bit for certain things. My daughter gets so excited to hatch monsters and get new parts of the song. You can also alter the song so it sounds different by muting certain monsters. Very fun.
A10HYIP18NQHC4 B0087TUZII 4 1343865600 24 seems like an ok game so far. just started it though. wish there was a game like this that didn't need real money though!
A10HYIP18NQHC4 B007T8Z5PG 1 1343952000 54 Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS APP!!!! It took 15 minutes to download, and then when i tried to open it on my kindle fire it said there was an app issue & to "force close" Now I cannot get a hold of the app publisher to correct this problem! WASTE OF $2.99!!!
A10HYIP18NQHC4 B00846WWVM 4 1363737600 38 This is a cute game. It is somewhat challenging, but just right for my 8 year old. I don't know if I would have paid for this, but i got it as a free game of the day.
A10I18BTNB3G1T B008L29K6E 5 1381449600 21 This is a fun and challenging puzzle game. Cool dinosaur pictures. Could be more puzzles but it is a free one.
A10I18BTNB3G1T B00B9AGS42 3 1404864000 23 Fun game, but too many ads on the free version. Also, crashes my Kindle Fire each time I play more than one level.
A10I18BTNB3G1T B00CSR2J9I 5 1392681600 41 I love his game, my daughter loves it too. She is way better at it them I am,  but we have fun playing it on Kindle Fire and phone. Great game. No problems with freezing or anything else. Great time waster!
A10I18BTNB3G1T B008Y212PI 5 1381017600 20 This is a fun game. Pictures are pretty and games are challenging. I got it free but worth two bucks
A10I18BTNB3G1T B00FPISXPQ 3 1400025600 49 The game itself is good. The pictures are beautiful and tons of free ones in lots of catagories, but on the free version a 64 piece puzzle is the most you can do. Disappointing...that is not challenging enough. I prefer 108 pieces so I won't be keeping this one.
A10I6CVBTPABO8 B004SJ3204 2 1380758400 30 I don't care for the looks and setup of the game. Especially as compared to Aces Cribbage. I simply like the looks of Aces Cribbage better, and how it works.
A10I7FJJDJG5UH B004SZ1U66 5 1344729600 32 I love playing this game. Even the freestyle allows me to be creative. I've finished all of the &quot;missions&quot; so to speak, and I'm hoping for more challenges in a future update.
A10I8IRUYM2I40 B009ZE27US 1 1357257600 36 even though its free it is a complete rip off of what you were probably expecting. it dosent even go below the age 20. so don't get it cuz its really dumband a complete rip off
A10IDYZUZHF91W B0087TUZII 4 1344643200 20 its a good time waster. good story line better then some I have played.so I rate it a 4 star
A10IDYZUZHF91W B00DCU2TCC 4 1374019200 24 Download it if your in to playing slots It's a great time waster . The slots are ok and the time played is fun.
A10IDYZUZHF91W B0081IRIKI 5 1339718400 23 its the best slot game that I have played in awhile download it and try it for yourself the bonus are ok to
A10IDYZUZHF91W B00KQHVWWC 4 1405123200 22 It's one of the best casino games I have played so far . It  has good bonus plus its good slot games
A10IDYZUZHF91W B008D2QRAO 5 1345766400 20 the pay out are better then some game a good time waster have had a problem with game play yet
A10IDYZUZHF91W B00H1L6L86 5 1394928000 22 It's a great app  good bonus and great over all game play. If it into slots this is the game for you
A10IFNRF7HTR2W B00GP0G0IK 1 1389657600 38 not sure if I like game or not received  a message stating that  game did not download completely.  I will try again.  Hope it works. love hidden object games .  reviews sounded like this one would be fun.
A10IFNRF7HTR2W B00A9JG6RS 5 1358380800 20 I gave a 5 star recommendation because I loved this match game. I would highly recommend this game to others.
A10IFNRF7HTR2W B0085P2Z6E 5 1358380800 21 This is an enjoyable game. I enjoyed finding the hidden objects and the adventure games.  I would highly recommend the game.
A10IFNRF7HTR2W B009ZHQLHA 1 1358380800 24 This would never download to my Kindle fire hd or to my kindle fire.  Not sure if I would like the game or not.
A10IG0MQLPPZ3I B007TNS6JI 5 1358035200 25 best app I ever got on my kindle fire Its awsome and free good thing to I have a lot of stuff on this game
A10IG0MQLPPZ3I B00APKHA9Y 5 1356998400 22 this game is epic if u love zombies then u will love this game I promise u it a good zombie game
A10IG0MQLPPZ3I B0080K98U0 5 1376265600 27 I love this the only bad is that you have to have wifi and u need to buy a lot of potion I mean like 500 hundred
A10IG7CSWPFX52 B008XG1X18 4 1394928000 20 Something I will use often was worth it to add to my collection, go on and give it a try
A10IG7CSWPFX52 B00BYJ6BUO 4 1395705600 38 It was so nice to jump in my warm bed with my Kindle fire and watch my favorite show without any effort on my part. The picture was clear and crisp, as I said &#34; I love it&#34;!
A10IGJ5Q3Z9WIA B00DUGCLY4 5 1404518400 37 Its wonderful its challenging if u don't understand emoji's but yea the one with the rabbit head and egg in the frying pan stumped me for awhile but then I figured out it was Easter egg lol
A10IGJ5Q3Z9WIA B00FLMU7BY 5 1382140800 30 if you no the beat and can sing the words but don't no the title look it up on tootle that's what I do and it is an awesome app
A10IGJ5Q3Z9WIA B00BGC5UAG 5 1361577600 31 its the exact same thing as whats the word but u should get it anyway and whats the word who ever reads this should get both they a lot of FUUUUUUNNN
A10IGJ5Q3Z9WIA B0092KDEGG 5 1363132800 52 this addictively fun it takes u to different rooms and u can find differt stuff to get out oglf the room that the weird lady has u in.....but any way its tottaly fun evefy should get it.......... but i cant get past the 4th room on the first episode please help meeee
A10IGJ5Q3Z9WIA B00A1SL8SE 5 1358553600 36 its fun and all that but what I think is stupid is that u only get 2 worlds and some u don't get freezes and some u get a limited amount but its great and all!!!!
A10IGU5KZQG7US B0071PARPA 5 1341273600 21 I love this app! it is so kewl because there are different settings for the color and stroke of the pencil.
A10IGU5KZQG7US B00876UUN6 5 1346976000 34 its like pokemon. and if u love that then you, ail love love love love love love love love love love this amazingly wonderful game that's is so fun youxdont want toxput it down.
A10IGU5KZQG7US B00846GKTW 5 1338768000 41 I love this game. it will really help people out with what looks good together,  and how the should wear things. and if you thought this is wat tu want to do as your career then you have a head start.
A10IMBCKOMEXH4 B008Y7SMQU 4 1348358400 22 its fun to play but its also hard at the same time. If you like hard games. I would recommend this game
A10IMBCKOMEXH4 B008JGSM6G 5 1344297600 25 its really fun and hard at the same time but its a workout for your brain. If you like challenge you would like this game.:)
A10IMBCKOMEXH4 B008XG1X18 5 1346630400 29 This app is amazing on kindle fire sometimes it dosen't load fast enough but I love this app. It helps so you don't have to go on the Internet.
A10IMBCKOMEXH4 B006OBWGHO 5 1329696000 20 This game is very additive its fun, Sure I wish it was like the full verson but its funvfor KIDS!!!
A10IMBCKOMEXH4 B007TXUZ1U 3 1338854400 20 I love this tame but I hats how you have to have a certin amount of points to buy things...
A10IMBCKOMEXH4 B008H4MVRG 5 1344470400 22 This game is very fun. I play on it everyday. You get all these different animals. I love this game so much:).
A10IOE89402WYK B007SXGTH0 1 1349136000 29 Paid version is probably great. I loved it until it said I could only create three notes. Three! Why keep it? I didn't. Bettter luck with the paid version.
A10IOE89402WYK B004UID2LC 5 1368489600 66 This is by far my favorite app on my kindle fire (even better than all my games!)  because I can watch all my favorite videos from Youtube even when I don't have Wi-Fi!! Brilliant! I was especially happy I got the app when a channel I liked got deleted from the web ... but my favorite vids were safely stored in my gallery! Definitely suggest it.
A10IOE89402WYK B008RKNG88 2 1351728000 38 I got this app just to see if it was really as bad as the reviews said and it was. glad it was free ... not worth paying for. the background music is better than the game itself
A10IOE89402WYK B005DSLRDS 1 1373500800 54 The good thing first: They had the 1980's A-Team theme song. (YAYY!!)The bad thing(s) that ruined the app for me: CUSS WORDS!!! DO NOT LET YOUR CHILD PLAY THIS GAME OR THEY WILL BE BLASTED WITH FOUL LANGUAGE!!Terrible app, don't download ... unless cuss words don't bother you. In that case, go right ahead.
A10IOE89402WYK B00DJFIMW6 5 1373500800 112 I love the movie Despicable Me. I saw and loved Despicable Me 2. So I knew I would love this app! And I was right! It's basically a mix of Temple Run and Subway Surfers, two of my favorite games, so I really enjoyed it. Great time-killer for Despicable Me fans!!10-08-2013 EDIT:Okay, I meant to add this sooner, but this game and other Gameloft apps freeze my Kindle Fire. Unless I had all WiFi bars, the game froze and I had to wait for my Kindle Fire to run out of battery and then plug it back in and blah blah bah. This problem may or may not occur on your device.
A10IOE89402WYK B009ZZDNT6 2 1373500800 41 It's an okay app, but there are definitely better alarm clock apps out there. I got it because it sounded great, even better than the alarm clock app I already have, but it wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
A10IOE89402WYK B0063IH60K 5 1345852800 23 this app is great : it's just like playing solitaire on your computer or in real life!!! I would definitely recommend this app!
A10IOE89402WYK B007SYDYLS 3 1349136000 24 this is a good app and its fun but I'm glad its free cause I wouldn't pay for it. it helps pass the time.
A10IOE89402WYK B007SXYAIA 3 1373500800 32 I was expecting this to be more like Ice Cream Jump, but it was still ok. Fun for little kids, but it can get boring pretty quickly. I'm glad it was free.
A10IOE89402WYK B005FM77HW 4 1373500800 126 I needed a good app to keep my siblings out of the apps that I wanted to maintain a good score on (Jetpack Joyride, Subway Surfers, etc.) and things I wanted to keep private (email, notebooks, etc.). The app definitely serves that purpose, and even has a fake 'force close' notification box that pops up when they try to open the app. If I press and hold, then the password pad pops up. If they just tap, then it goes back to the main screen of my kindle fire. The only problem is, the app appears on my carousel and my siblings wonder what it is .... if this can be fixed, I would give five stars. If that doesn't bother you, then definitely get it.
A10IOE89402WYK B00CHSPB8Y 3 1381190400 105 I definitely like the app for the game itself (I mean, who doesn't love Iron Man?) but I am still encountering difficulties with Gameloft! Constantly freezes my Kindle Fire. But I really do love the game, especially with the option to switch from touch controls to &#34;Gyro&#34; (tilt) control. Not a huge fan of the artwork ... wish Tony looked more like Robert Downey Jr ... but it still looks like Tony Stark, more or less. What's not to love?I would recommend this app, unless you have the same Gameloft issues I do. I loved the game but had to uninstall it because of that.
A10IOE89402WYK B006AZZPCM 5 1381190400 59 I like this app better than other YT downloader apps because of two really big factors: (a) I can watch videos within the app, and (b) it looks just like mobile YouTube! So I can easily navigate the app and I also have the option to download vids in mp3 format, as audio in my music library! Definitely recommend.
A10IOE89402WYK B00C787O48 3 1373500800 28 This app is just like the cut the rope app ... except not as good. I'm glad it's free, because I don't think I would pay for it.
A10IPLH4EC2AUJ B0097M6WDG 2 1350086400 34 I think its just like temple run but with a streaker its gross that there is an option that says uncensored are you sure you want to. well I think that is way inappropriate.
A10IPLH4EC2AUJ B005HPIO88 1 1327363200 24 this is scary it has a scary backpack and t is not for backpack it is so so so not educational removing from device
A10IPLH4EC2AUJ B005UQ9FNC 5 1326326400 21 it was.so awesome for a week then stopped working for kindle fire please please fix this.after that total 5 star game.
A10IPLH4EC2AUJ B0071PS7AC 1 1330992000 23 don't get this app. the controls are terrible. the highest my score ever gets is ten. that's all. good thing this was free.
A10IWHA0811ONZ B00HHBXYGM 4 1393718400 20 great game but it takes forever to unlock other areas because not a lot of people are playing it yet
A10IWHA0811ONZ B007TO3JW6 5 1349827200 23 awesome game one of the few that doesn't freeze up !!! never a problem, I wish they would come out with other games.
A10IWHA0811ONZ B00881VLCE 4 1399248000 22 great puzzles for free. there are 3levels plus being able to rotate the pieces. it should take a few days to complete.
A10IWHA0811ONZ B0089Z3D02 5 1344384000 24 I love pogo now I wish it would get Chuzzle one of my favorites along with others when a can we expect more games?
A10IX0WY4W3VYO B008JGSM6G 5 1357776000 41 Works very well with the device and is super fun! My boyfriend loves this game so I knew I had to check it out. It's addicting and I'm glad they have so many levels available to keep users interested / busy.
A10IX0WY4W3VYO B005ZFOOE8 5 1357776000 26 Works flawlessly on the device and compliments the speakers of the system. The visuals are nice and it responds quickly when suggestions are made. Nice work!
A10IY8PPT5OQE5 B004JK61K0 5 1355875200 27 Product works well. Had no difficulty setting up. Takes a bit of sorting to figure out which mail came from yahoo or gmail. But not too hard
A10IYH8MS5WVMT B004SIIBGU 5 1400630400 29 Where you can find any and everything your heart desires and at good prices!  Always a good find! Never have had one problem with purchasing or selling on eBay!
A10IYH8MS5WVMT B0094BB4TW 3 1400630400 47 I don't use it as much as I thought I would.  It seems people use it to post their daily lives...which I get annoyed with.  There are some things one should not post publicly. Otherwise, FB is great for keeping in touch with your friends and families.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B005NJ2K6U 3 1319500800 58 Nice twist to the overdone 3-in-a-row games.  I can see most people deciding between this game and one of the other 20 games on their phone that Amazon has offered as a free app.  And even though it takes a different approach, it's still a big file (19MB) and I think that is the deal breaker for me.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B004GBARY8 3 1319414400 181 This live wallpaper looks and does exactly as described.  I was happy to try out a Halloween themed wallpaper for a few weeks until Halloween passed but I am uninstalling it now.  You have some options with a few different backgrounds:-you can choose between 3 colors of fog and how much fog is on the screen.-choose how many pumpkins but u can not remove them all-there are bats that fly around on the screen which you can remove.I guess it can also be a game too since u can get points for smashing pumpkins and bats, it will keep track for you.  But that got old after 10 seconds.Parts of the app are nice but I would like to be able to remove all pumpkins or at least move them where I want, just so an apps icon is not sitting directly on top of one.  There was a pumpkin sitting directly underneath my camera apps icon and it made it semi difficult to see.5 stars for the app fitting the description.1 star for how much I want to use it.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B004SJIEXY 4 1316995200 56 First thoughts were, oh great another match 3-of-a-kind game.  Still installed and played.  By the time I quit I had been playing for 3 hours.  It has the same general idea as others except there many other goals and a few other games inside of the main one, I guess you may call a bonus level.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B004XNGKBS 5 1317081600 109 First off it does exactly what is says it can, what ever motion my finger does it replicated.However, I don't see this as something people will use &quot;just to take a quick note&quot;.  Where I see it getting the most use is by kids.  It could be made into a fun game or a place to create a drawing.  When you are done you can save your work as a picture (jpg or png).Has the ability to copy / paste normal text from the clipboard.  Select different sizes and colors of your pen.  And you are still able to use the soft keyboard on your phone if you wish.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B004RCUJ9E 5 1318723200 78 I really spend a lot of time playing sudoku on my phone and this will make a nice compliment to it.Very easy to understand, pick your color of pieces, difficulty level of the computer, click on a piece and it shows you the available moves.Checkers should be an easy and enjoyable game to play, and with the high quality graphics and nice user interface this app is something i will keep on my phone and use quite often.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B004UIBIHM 5 1314921600 139 I felt the need to run this app since I saw an earlier review saying the password did not work.  It DOES work and I was unable to access my info.unless I had the password. It does need to be at least 4 digits long though.Also, I was a little unsure how secure my info would be if stored on my phone.  I was able to find the checkbook app on my SD card, open it up and find a database folder.  I tried opening the db with multiple programs and was only able to see defaults words that were built into the app like categories and menu names.  I was not able to see any digits except for a date, all other numbers were encrypted.  I don't know everything, but I do feel this app is very secure.
A10J1BJCO4IBVS B004V4IUEE 5 1329696000 63 Great for people with the kindle fire, but unnecessary for people using an Android phone made by HTC and possibly other manufacturer's.  This calculator does a great job and is worth its 5 stars, but this calculator functions almost identical to the free one that comes stock with your phone.  The biggest difference is you can change skins (the colors/look of the calculator).
A10J8X6Q096LNH B008XG1X18 5 1392595200 67 I really love this app and it's utilities. Sharing the finest recipes, fashions....oh heck, just about anything that becomes meaningfully conveyed w/a picture and your caption or thoughts as well. I love the secret boards and the easy way to add an item. It's also great to browse and search. I love that you can follow a poster's picks too. Pinterest is one of my internet favorites.
A10J8X6Q096LNH B00HTYNMWS 3 1393286400 36 I was looking for the Pet Rescue Saga app.  It's ok but not as flexible in terms of tools as the Pet Rescue. I'm not liking the interruptions of corporate sponsor (advertisements). Otherwise, good time killer.
A10JFW10WI8MX0 B008JK6W5K 5 1354233600 25 This game is very addictive and a good time waister. I love this app and I think all people should get it.P.S. It's free! (rhcpforever4)
A10JFW10WI8MX0 B0063IH60K 4 1336262400 37 I have enjoyed this game a lot, but I suggest that the creators of this game should make the game more exciting during the game and when you win or lose. Overall, this game is pretty good.
A10JFW10WI8MX0 B0054JZC6E 5 1336176000 25 I really enjoyed this app because you can get 100+games from 1 app! I feel I can safely say this app definitely deserves 5 stars!
A10JH0DWDLECA6 B004K4RY9M 4 1402790400 33 This game is great but a few times I played,I found that some words will repeat on the same spot on the list,and in the exact same place.Love it but can be glitchy
A10JH0DWDLECA6 B00DJFIMW6 5 1399593600 27 I'm not THAT big of a gamer,but when I played this game,I was amazed.I felt like I was running with the minions.THATS how real the graphics are
A10JH0DWDLECA6 B00HEVJU7W 5 1402790400 98 This game (app I should say :) ) is BEAST! It entertains me when I am bored out of my mind (which is often)I seriously recommend it and think that it should be around for years to come!This app allows you to play games,watch videos and full episodes,let's you VOTE for what should happen,and even do stuff that is not even on the SITEIt still can be glichy and you have to put in some cable address (whatever THAT is).I recommend that you do not put in your cable thingy and enjoy the app!Hope you love it!From creeperking

A10JJF3KPSL4UI B008171UVM 5 1337472000 26 Very cool game. easy to play and addictive! The only downfall is having the kindle fire and needing an Internet connection. Add me if you'd like.
A10JJF3KPSL4UI B007DKC922 2 1332633600 20 I have a kindle fire and keep have to force closing the app. It seems like a great game otherwise.
A10JJF3KPSL4UI B006OCM13M 5 1331164800 23 A great game for kids! Very addicting! I highly reccomend this and the other team lava games for the fire! add me tmartin6938
A10JKY45V2JEWK B008CFVG58 4 1342915200 25 if u like this game u should get pet salon there almost exactly the same! I love pet salon and I like this game too!
A10JKY45V2JEWK B0050KDTSK 5 1330732800 44 this is probably my favorite game I have so far its tons of fun, you get to make a lot of money, grow crops, decorate ur farm, talk to friends and visit other farms. soo much fun. I really enjoy it. so will u
A10JKY45V2JEWK B004Q87AA0 1 1336953600 29 I down loaded this app before I looked at the reveiws, but amidietly after I saw the reviews I uninstalled it do u think my kindle is still safe?
A10JKY45V2JEWK B00846GMHW 1 1340150400 34 its basicly sad and pretty stupid i think, I wouldn't clog my kindels memorie with it. but that's just me. the name is pretty sad too, &quot;throw the knife&quot;, that's basicly all u do!!
A10JKY45V2JEWK B005KCQZ2K 5 1330732800 56 this game is woo much fun!!!  and its supper adicting I have to stop my self from playing it somethings though because when I do play it I find my self playing it for hours!  I highly recommend it. its not just for little kids anyone of any age can play it, the carecters are adorable.
A10JKY45V2JEWK B007HIM53I 4 1332979200 57 just like all the &quot;TeamLava&quot; games its amazing and really fun!!  u practicly get to host a night club and play any music u have downloaded on ur device at ur night club and u can make drinks and have them sold at ur nightclub. it also really fun cause u get to desighn ur night club.
A10JKY45V2JEWK B006HJKKCG 3 1359849600 36 its good for a free translater. like any translater its only right 60% of the time but its knows most the basics. its helpfull if ur taking Spanish 1. and I asume any language 1 class.
A10JKY45V2JEWK B004VMUS9G 5 1346544000 50 it works perfectly!!!! I cant believe this app is free I wouldn't mind paying $5 for this app its so good!! Ivan costumize ur alarm from what song it plays, all the way ti what Color it is!!!! u can eve make playlists on this app! I seriously recomend it!!!
A10JRMPVXD0RQR B00975HIYU 5 1369094400 20 Just got this game and already know that it is going to be one of my favorites love the bonus
A10JRMPVXD0RQR B008K6G8CK 5 1393200000 24 Lots of different games to pick from and enjoy.earn tokens and oodles to use.best app I have found.more fun than going to a casino.
A10JRMPVXD0RQR B00E8KLWB4 3 1389830400 21 Enjoying it but don't know all the different helps and how to get them and when to use them.need more instructions.
A10JRMPVXD0RQR B00EYTRD0I 5 1381708800 21 Good game to keep your mind sharp and focused.if you get stuck you can get a letter to help you out.
A10JWTG2XTZVW1 B00CWY76CC 4 1391472000 29 So entertaining and a great way to cure my boredom! I can't wait to see what is on the next level each time I successfully get out. Pretty cool!
A10JWTG2XTZVW1 B0097HSS4M 5 1360195200 21 Making sure your pictures are always fabulous is easy with this app! Blotting out blemishes is my favorite part. Love this!
A10JWTG2XTZVW1 B008XG1X18 4 1367884800 21 I LOVE this app!! I spend time on it daily for all kinds of things. Be careful, it is addicting! Lol
A10JWTG2XTZVW1 B006OCM0G0 5 1361664000 32 I have been playing for about two weeks and was suggested this game based on others I have. This is so addicting and fun! I am on it several times a day!!!!
A10JWTG2XTZVW1 B00CZCX2S8 3 1388880000 23 This is a pretty cool way to pass some boredom. After the tutorial, it's easy to grasp. I really like the auto-dub feature.
A10K1C3GKIHE3C B00BR4QNJ0 5 1369180800 22 This is a really great app an I recommend it to anyone who likes zombies and other things to complete my review
A10K1C3GKIHE3C B0086700CM 5 1338768000 22 This is a very good app and for one thing it is free. I would have bought this game if it wasn't.
A10K1C3GKIHE3C B007PT3QOQ 5 1344384000 22 ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies ponies my little pony pony pony pony pony pony pony friendship is magic!
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B00ENTDDGW 4 1384128000 41 Great game.  Fun to play.  My only issue is that when I go to quit it does not close cleanly; it goes to a &quot;force close.&quot;  It would receive a 5 star rating from me if it weren't for that issue.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B0073U6WLG 4 1332806400 32 Plays great, graphics are okay.  Why the 4 star?  Simple.  I don't like having to log onto the wireless when I want to play.  Remove that and I'll give it 5 stars.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B0085N9I84 3 1338681600 49 Ignore the blatant 5 star reviews.  A few may be legit but that many?  I don't believe it.I normally love this type of game but this one goes overboard with the &quot;quests.&quot;  It's repetitive.  Kids may like it for a while but even their attention span will wane quickly.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B007PT3QOQ 3 1334361600 36 Download/Install:  OKInternet required to play.  Freezes Kindle if not available.Game play:  This is the kind of game I like.  I don't like the fact that the Internet is required.  That limits where I can play it.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B004WGGQPQ 5 1323129600 53 Two thumbs up for everything!I downloaded without first checking the reviews, as is my normal routine and I am not disappointed!I love the variety of drawing tools, color and paper.  The GUI is easy to learn and use; it outperforms all other drawing programs that I've downloaded (and deleted).This app is a keeper!
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B005ZY5U2E 5 1323993600 51 Downloaded/Installed with no problems.  Plays without a problem.For word game nuts, like myself, you will find this easy to play and addicting.  Beware the birds... they'll start to perch in the middle of your game if you make words where the letters don't touch.  This results in fewer letters to use.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B004SJ3BCI 5 1322870400 57 I had never played the game before I bought the Fire.  I am now addicted.  The ease of play and simple touch controls allows me to quickly replay a level.I love the graphics and sound effects; I find myself laughing even as I lose the level.Two thumbs up for game play, graphics, sound effects and replay value.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B0062OFUNU 5 1332979200 20 My favorite sit down restaurants such as Bob Evans are included.  Great app to guide you on you food selections.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B0067QCC70 3 1324080000 40 Download/Install: okForced Close: yesI love the style of game, but the game is a bit difficult to play on this device.  Even using the pinch method didn't help much.  Others may like it, but this version is not for me.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B007MNV5WU 4 1332547200 30 And it does have ads.  It took a while for them to pop up, but they finally did.  I'd give it a 5 star rating if it weren't for that.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B00FAPF5U0 3 1383868800 44 After a certain level you need friends to continue playing.  As I do not have or want friends for the game I have deleted it from my Kindle Fire.  I am glad I got it for free or I would really be ticked off.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B004DPIEF6 5 1329436800 37 according to the radar, my house has at least a dozen chatty ghosts.A cute tongue-in-cheek app that will be sure to cause supernatural believers to dig out the ghost hunting equipment and head for the closest cemetery.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B0071QIN00 5 1328918400 68 Downloaded and installed fine.  Played without crashing.  Options available to control sound.Ok, with that said, this is a very cool game!  I'm not normally into this style of game, but tried anyway and I love it.  Graphics are wonderful, controls aren't bad and the crashes (which I do often) are cool.  It's free, give it a try and an honest review.  Please remember to not feed the trolls!
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B004N8KDNY 4 1329004800 66 Downloaded/Installed/Opened: NO PROBLEMSBriefing room video:  Would NOT initialize, hence the 4 star rating.Beyond that, it's a fun game, love the aliens.  I guess that would be my one suggestion, let the player pick the side to play.  I'll keep it to help pass the time.  REMINDER:  Please review the app itself without comparing it to another game and as always, please do not feed the trolls.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B006N1K1AE 5 1332806400 54 When I saw the size of the app, I didn't think there would be a lot to it, BUT... the mirroring of the drawing is very cool indeed.  I'm pretty good at drawing one side of a cartoon face, but generally can't draw the other to make it look right.  Now I can!!!  WOOHOO!
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B00683JNUQ 5 1322956800 49 This game is new to me.  After installing it, I played the tutorial and was hooked.  The controls are easy to use, no problem with response from the Kindle.Two thumbs up for: graphics, ease of play and the addictive nature of the game... AND it is free (for today).
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B0071PS7AC 5 1330992000 31 Yes, the controls are sensitive, but once I got used to it I was to bowl a few strikes.  Nice graphics and decent sound effects.No complaints from this wanna-be bowler pro!
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B008910NAO 5 1356134400 37 Yes, it's Solitaire, but with subtle Christmas color.  Plays well, looks nice and the app itself functions without issue.  I didn't pay attention to the price since today it's free, but I would pay money for it.
A10K7PR3MPGC77 B005V20JKI 4 1322006400 60 It loads.  It plays.  The game can't keep track of which way is up.  I kept the Kindle Fire at the correct level for playing on the horizontal level, the same as other apps, yet it kept flip-flopping while playing.  This made it rather difficult to play when the screen kept switching.Other than that, the game seems to play fine.
A10KA5WRHTOTQC B00ANHJ8K8 5 1365120000 23 I really enjoy playing this game and am excited to progress further in it. Thanks to the game makers for giving me gifts.
A10KA5WRHTOTQC B00E5GJ7QS 5 1384300800 29 This is aGreat game. Love the power ups  and how easy it is to win tickets. Would suggest to all bingo lovers. Wonderful way to spend a boring day.
A10KA5WRHTOTQC B00BJ4ETBW 5 1365120000 32 Excellent game. I like the game play as well as the storyline. Would recommend to all of my friends. I hope they make more games like this to download onto kindle HD.
A10KEZ871RP5DB B00BHHIWQO 4 1367452800 46 I do like this game and played it a lot then all of a sudden it stopped working and I couldn't get it back and ended up just deleting it.  I don't know what happened, but I'll try to download it again and see what happens.
A10KEZ871RP5DB B009WO7NQO 3 1358121600 37 this game is harder than others, won't let you play but several games and then you have to buy more to finish.  But I probably won't play this game all the way through what I have anyway.
A10KEZ871RP5DB B007USZX7U 4 1358121600 21 I'm always ready to play Mahjong!  It's fun and helps out the memory!  Will keep playing.  I like the different tiles.
A10KEZ871RP5DB B009KS4XRO 4 1363392000 20 sounds like fun, works fine and you're playing against others on line.  It is a good fast game to play.
A10KEZ871RP5DB B00A6W03Z4 3 1366329600 30 tried for 3 days to download! still not downloaded. will keep trying. otherwise I will just delete it..waste!  hope not. I like this game. UPDATE:  Game downloaded and works great!!!!!
A10KEZ871RP5DB B007SYXJXG 5 1355184000 21 This works great, easy to find what I need and easy to record what I need to see.  I love it.
A10KEZ871RP5DB B005UOK2KY 4 1358121600 38 I like to play this, I've played all the ones that are on the game, the balloon pop thing is fun and I really don't have to think to much!  Sitting in hospital waiting room, I like it!
A10KEZ871RP5DB B00FB13Y74 4 1393200000 24 Always fun to play!!!! With new additions, it's fun to go through these games to find them and learn how to use them.  Enjoy!!
A10KEZ871RP5DB B005HXUSS4 1 1358121600 21 this game is hard to play on my Kindle, not sure why, but I will probably delete it. way to sensitive.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00HWD2OE8 4 1391385600 27 Was a fun game! Really cool - my son likes it a lot. We got it for free- so you can't beat that. I would recommend it!
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00CZY1ZV2 4 1379116800 28 Cute game but it is short and simple. My kids liked it but got bored as soon as the did everything - which they did within a day.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00B7Y0206 5 1383264000 37 This app is pretty simple and the title of it is what it really does. I needed to download it on my Kindle to watch You Tube content and it does the job. So, no complaints here...
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00B5DLSMU 4 1366675200 45 This was fun - but I got sick of the ads and wanted to be able to practice when I wasn't competing - so I upgraded to the paid version - it was only a dollar or two and I like that a lot better.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B0058VW36U 5 1387324800 35 I am not 100% sure how to play this game - but my kids do and they LOVE it! It is cute (I have to say) I think the idea behind it is very clever!
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00A3XR6HO 3 1356480000 46 This is a cute game - but I was looking for something a little more challenging. Also, it seems like there are not very good directions - at least I have not found the detailed info that I have been looking for. Still it is cute.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B008Y2FRFO 3 1400284800 43 This is okay - my kids were amused for a little while - but there is not much to the game so they got board. In any event, it was free - so it was worth downloading for the minor amusement it gave.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00BSW0M34 3 1366675200 49 Downloaded this on my Kindle Fire - it is cute and the graphics are nice - but I had a hard time trying to figure out what to do and you can only imagine how hard it was for my kids - they got frustrated and a little bored.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B0066TUXU6 5 1388880000 71 I love Hulu+ - and it's nice that I can use it on my Kindle thanks to this app. I have had no issues with using the app and Hulu + keeps me as a customer because of the variety of shows they offer in streaming. Very highly recommended to people who may not want cable - but still want to have the option to watch shows for a good price.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00C787O48 4 1366675200 55 This is a cute new version of the cut the rope game. My kids like it because of the Dino - but it is kind of the same as the original game. However - I did think some of the earlier levels were a little harder - so I guess that adds to the challenge.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00BS3UFCQ 3 1369267200 73 This was kind of like the &#34;Guess the Logo&#34; game - I was hoping it was going to be different - with either showing brief scenes from the movies or pictures - but I guess that would involve copyright clearance. In any event, I really did not like it - I got some of the clues - but most seemed vague and hard to connect to the film they are supposed to represent.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00FRQ32N4 5 1384646400 25 My son really loves this game. He likes robots and loved the movie Real Steel - so this is the perfect little game for him.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00B7KKNI6 4 1362441600 49 I like this game - my only issue is that it is impossible to get all the words with the time they give you. They should allow time extensions for words that are longer than five or six letters - this would make it a little more challenging too.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00IKZX1ZI 5 1400284800 53 This is a super fun game - if you are a fan of Candy Crush - you will probably like this. I like this more than Candy Crush because it is a bit simpler and the graphics are way prettier - although I am a bit biased - I LOVE the movie Frozen...
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00ABGFFOO 3 1362441600 23 Not really a great game - my kids got bored really quick and I removed it from my Kindle. Could be more interesting.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00DJFIMW6 4 1379116800 34 This was a cute game - kind of like Temple run but obviously some different goals. My little ones have fun with it and the graphics were really cool - almost like the movie.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00CKOYVG8 4 1390694400 30 I love the original Angry Birds - but this is hard to really get in to - I don't know why - I guess I just like the traditional version.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B004UID2LC 5 1388880000 39 What can I say - this does what it is supposed to do - no problems with it. I would recommend it for people who use You Tube on their Kindle - it makes it easier to view videos.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B004SOR4H6 5 1378771200 23 Wanted to link to Twitter on my Kindle - so I downloaded the app. Now I can link to Twitter on my Kindle.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00E46D1QQ 3 1379116800 27 Cute because it has Mickey Mouse. But there was not much to it. It was a free download so it was fine for what I paid... :)
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00B2V66VS 5 1389225600 34 Fun game! I loved the first one so I was excited when the second one came out! It did not disappoint! If you like the first Temple Run you will probably like this one!!
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00ANT8OF6 4 1369267200 51 This app is very cool to look at and the sound is great too. The whole game seems a little sparse - I wish there was more to it. My daughter loves the show - but the game does not seem to have enough to hold her attention for very long.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00BQPEIT2 5 1381276800 24 I really like Temple Run and it this is a cool off-shoot of it. I like the connection to OZ and the monkeys. Fun!
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B009G1J62C 5 1355961600 64 I am an Angry Birds fan - but my kids really like this game. They tell me that it is fun because it is way more challenging. I have played it a few times and see their point. Having to construct different vehicles and really thinking about how they will do the job is very challenging. My kids have lots of fun with it!
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00AEEZK70 3 1387324800 25 This was okay but it was a little boring. I removed it from my Kindle after a week - I just lost interest in it,
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B009KEN87O 4 1388880000 74 As a child of the eighties - I grew up on Atari &#34;Space Invaders&#34; and this reminds me of that. Now, my kids who are growing up in the age of Xbox and Wii U may argue this game is &#34;boring.&#34; But, I disagree - I like it on my Kindle Fire - it helps to pass the time when I am waiting for an appointment or pick up. Fun/simple = fun to me!
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00992CF6W 5 1395792000 37 I know that Minecraft is the new thing - I don't really understand it - but my son wanted it and he absolutely loves it. He hase built an entire village so far and keeps on going.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00CSR2J9I 3 1379116800 35 This is a cute game but it was hard for me and it got a little frustrating which led to boredom. My daughter (16) loves it though. So, maybe it's just for the younger crowd...
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B004RCHGRC 5 1366675200 34 My husband has an android phone and cannot download words with friends - so we found this and it is basically the same - we really enjoy being able to compete with one another.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00885RFRK 5 1381363200 23 While I am not a huge fan of dinosaurs - my son is and he really enjoyed this game. It kept him occupied.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B008D2QRAO 3 1387324800 36 I like slot machines... but I don't really get this. If I am not earning money then it isn't really that fun. The graphics were cool. But I may be missing some point of the game.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00AKOB7CG 3 1388880000 38 This is a clever idea - relatively simple. I liked it - did not really motivate me to do exercises - and that's what I need. If this had more of a variety it would improve it too.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00FAPF5U0 5 1401062400 28 Okay, so I'm a little late to the game - but I really love candy crush. I will be joining the millions who waste hours on this game.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B005HSL626 4 1389225600 43 I have to admit, I like this game a lot at first - but it gets a little repetitive. It is fun for a laugh and it was free - so if you like motor skills games then you may enjoy this one.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00CWY76CC 5 1380067200 59 I really like this little ap/game. It is fun to figure out how to escape from a room and find clues - It kind of reminds me of the game MYST I used to play - but a lot more simple. I would LOVE if they expanded this and would def. pay more for a more complex story line.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00FATEJYE 2 1393200000 22 Primarily because it states it is the Kindle Tablet Edition - but it does not work on my Kindle Tablet. Very disappointing.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B009S984J8 4 1355961600 28 My daughter (4) really likes this. It would have been nice if it had a few more levels of play - but it is still fun for her.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B008N1V11U 5 1355961600 50 My son is a video game and Batman fanatic. This game fits in perfectly with his taste. I like it because it is portable and he is able to play it in the car. A little dark - so probably not for the younger crowd. But I really like it.
A10KHX41ONY4U1 B00CHSPB8Y 5 1369267200 62 Well, this is not a game I play - but my 9 year old son loves this. He keeps telling me how great the graphics are. He spends time on this game and seems to have a lot of fun. I downloaded it for free - but I would have paid for it based on how much my son has enjoyed it.
A10KI3AAE24LYB B00846GKTW 4 1337990400 21 well I just got this game and I'm 9 what does casual mean? guess I have to look in the dictionary
A10KI3AAE24LYB B007HIM53I 5 1353628800 47 THIS GAME IS AWESOME IM ON IT EVERYDAY CHECKING MY MESSAGES, DRINKS THAT ME FRIENDS SENT, TEXT, AND NEWS FEED. EVERYDAY U SHOULD GET PEOPLE AT UR CLUB DANCIN. YOU WILL HAVE A BALL ON THIS GAME AND U SHOULD GET ALL THE OLD AND NEW STORIES.

A10KI3AAE24LYB B00689PMD2 5 1343001600 34 This game I so addictive I am on it all day it is a great game for kids 8+PARENTS THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR UR KIDS TO PLAY EVEN U CAN PLAY TO.
A10KI3AAE24LYB B0086700CM 4 1343260800 47 Its ok but when u get to 1500 or something it gets hard and then when I keep trying and trying it gets hard.Finally I give up and I don't wanna play.So I wish they can put the speed down by making it go up just 100
A10KI3AAE24LYB B007OXASB2 5 1336348800 40 this game is so addictive u will be on this game all day.I never get my kindle fire because my daughter's always on this thing so I going to bye her one so she can STAY OF MY KNISLE FIRE
A10KI3AAE24LYB B007HGMVIE 1 1353628800 23 Its so boring the rest of the stories r runner than this. Don't get this game its a wast of ur time :(
A10KJ5MGQLQ3MS B004SBQGHS 5 1356998400 49 Loved that it was the app of the day, and enjoy it on all of my android devices. Would recomend to any of my friends or family. Even without the app of the day I would have bought this. Very fun and ad-free version is the best! Thanks Amazon.
A10KJ5MGQLQ3MS B004O4K4SQ 5 1356998400 54 If you are an arcade gamer, than you would know the classic game Galaga. Radiant HD runs that over. This brings a classic into a modern day version, with incredible asteroid field levels, and various lasers, bosses and enemies as well. Just a great game. A must have for any Android and Amazon user.
A10KJ5MGQLQ3MS B005ZXWMUS 3 1356998400 75 I love Netflix, and have been a subscriber for over a year, but would like to see honestly a little more effort put into the app. If YouTube can come this far with the app Google has created, and with Netflix being so huge these days, the app could be incredible. But the fact that Netflix is what it is as a service gives this application a four star. Great service overall, app needs work.
A10KQAW67VU7XE B00AMR1HZ8 4 1357516800 23 My grandkids (age 7 & 14) played with me and we really enjoyed this game.  We difinately will be playing it a lot.
A10KQAW67VU7XE B008FC5APU 4 1366156800 33 I really like this Gin Rummy game.  It is very easy to play and it is very addicting.  I find myself wanted to play a lot of games instead of just a few.
A10KQAW67VU7XE B0087TQYUG 1 1401753600 22 I deleted this game as I do not like to play against other players.  I didn't pay attention before I downloaded it.
A10KQAW67VU7XE B00GY0PQZ4 5 1401753600 24 This is a very interesting game.  The only problem is some of the catagories I have problems with and have to buy extra hints.
A10KQAW67VU7XE B004K4RY9M 4 1357516800 27 I only did a few puzzles but it is very easy to do and I really enjoy the challenge.  I will be playing this game a lot.
A10KQAW67VU7XE B0063IH60K 5 1357516800 21 I have always liked playing any game of Solitaire.  I will be playing it more than any game that I own.
A10KU3Z7EFJ8LG B00ESNW58K 5 1398643200 30 I love this game. It has so much to do and I keep finding something new every time I go to it. Thank-you for something new and different. It's awesome!
A10L1JJ2P4M2XL B004HE5TAG 4 1405209600 27 I would give it 5 stars, except that the game does not switch the value of an Ace from being worth 11 to 1  during the deal
A10L1JJ2P4M2XL B00CMF27DE 4 1391817600 20 This is a fun and relaxing game. It gives enough wins to keep me entertained and the music is fun.
A10L1JJ2P4M2XL B00E8KLWB4 4 1398816000 36 I love the game. It's entertaining and it changes up often enough to be worth it. 2 problems tho, need to increase number of crystals per level. And wish more people would accept my friend invites!
A10L2FCO3HWAK6 B00850NK6I 3 1388880000 32 But when it's all you've got, you deal with it. I get nervous about upgrading the software because my iTouch is 4 years old and Overdrive might obsolete it, like Apple did.
A10L2FCO3HWAK6 B00DJFIMW6 1 1378512000 57 We were really looking forward to this game because we are big fans of Despicable Me and I would love a minion or two.  We're trying to install it on my daughter's Trio Lite and the installation system won't come up.  The software downloads from Amazon Apps with no problem, but the installation system never comes up.Bummer!!
A10L33TZ6RVYIN B00CH87HF4 2 1379894400 80 I loved dungeon hunter 3 and still play it. I was really excited to see a new one. I downloaded it on my kindle fire hd because i have a 32GB version and this game takes up a lot of space. As it is now the game is too buggy to get through too much playtime. Im going to keep it installed though and wait for the update because im sure itll play great eventually. Right now? Not so great
A10L33TZ6RVYIN B0067VKQLE 5 1368576000 24 Fun and addicting. The game looks good and the controls are simple. It's fun trying to come up with the most productive plant placement
A10L33TZ6RVYIN B00DOIBYYG 1 1373155200 108 I have vine on my Samsung galaxy and it's a great app. 6 second looping videos is an ingenious idea on how to see a tiny bit of what others are seeing. However on kindle fire hd the app just plain old doesn't work. At least not yet anyways. It's a newer app for kindle fire so I was expecting a few problems. These are not little problems. It freezes and then forces you to close it every time. I have a lot of confidence it'll be up and running smoothly fairly soon and when it is I'll update my review. But for now? Wait a couple weeks
A10L33TZ6RVYIN B00AO2P3GA 4 1370476800 27 A decent shooter for the kindle. Controls aren't too bad just a few quirks like where they put the grenade swipe you hit it accidentally a lot
A10L3Z0WNJCYKI B009C7ZQM4 5 1388620800 22 Love this app. Let's me know when I need to clean house in the different departments to keep my phone running well.
A10L3Z0WNJCYKI B006AZZPCM 5 1388620800 21 Works when others don't! I love it!! Highly recommend it.... specially when Silk doesn't come through. You'll always have the choice!
A10L3Z0WNJCYKI B005ZXWMUS 4 1340755200 61 I love Netflix and the fact I can watch it on any of my devices. Trouble is, it sometimes leaves me mid -movie, and sometimes I have issues trying to get it back again.  Specially when it's in a series. I guess when I master it,  Netflix will have 5 stars. Not sure it it's me or Netflix at this point.
A10L7R7Q0FQIPX B00FAPF5U0 5 1382745600 25 I kept watching for this game to come out for kindle. so much bigger play area than my phone. still very addictive. challenging and fun.
A10L7SSV5YAMN5 B00BM8UNUQ 4 1362528000 22 yes. hope the whole series come out. can't wait. love that you get more upgrades and get to decorate the V.I.P  room
A10L7SSV5YAMN5 B00B2WWEFE 4 1361923200 55 can't wait for the next dash series game to come out.brought the upgrade to have all the levels.got more guests like the wedding crasherIn a couple levels it was hard to move the people waiting because they were so close to the table that it would click to the table instead of moving the people
A10L7SSV5YAMN5 B00702PZME 4 1334361600 27 fun to play.  good way to learn words that are similar and opposite. and it also free. 20 levels free then you can upgrade for more levels
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00A77II0U 4 1355529600 48 Great story, plays well on my Samsung Galaxy.  Would have given it a 5 star but for the fact that the time to go from scene to scene or into a tapped area is a little long.  Do recommend to those that like a good hidden object adventure
A10LBT4V6Z635U B008N04TMO 5 1346889600 31 This is a wonderful game with great graphics.  It played really well with no glitches on my Samsung Galaxy. Type of game you can play over again and still be entertained.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B008L29K6E 5 1356307200 29 Really fun game.  Makes you think but not too hard.  One of the best boredom busters I have played.  If you like brain games this is a great one.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00CX713IG 3 1371168000 35 For a time waster while waiting for an appt, etc it is okay.  To just sit and play it is very repetitive and somewhat boring.  Just a simple straight forward hidden object game, no story.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B0084DYNGC 5 1375142400 37 just starting game again for thr second time, great game but first time it froze when i was almost finished. This game was enjoyable the first time hoping bug is fixed so i can finish this time.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B006RM6JCI 4 1352246400 24 I have a lot of fun playing this game.  Makes you think, can replay to better your score.  Nice graphics.  Good game for relaxing.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00BI3AFPI 1 1363737600 20 After download game would not work on my Samsung.  It would turn off when I clicked on the play button.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00BI2QOYA 1 1373846400 24 Did not get to play as it would not work on my Samsung Galaxy tablet.  Wish they would make more games for Android Tablets.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00ADIT8U2 4 1356048000 38 Took a little trial and error to get started but great game after i got going.  Would give 5 stars if it was longer and a bit more difficult.  Overall well done game, great graphics, good job coolgeeks.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B008Y212PI 4 1363392000 40 this game is great in making you use math and logic skills.  It helps keep your mind sharp and your reasoning skills at the top of the game.  Beside it is entertaining and makes waiting for appt. Go by quickly.
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00B2W289G 5 1360627200 96 Love this game, puzzle are so much fun and different than the ordinary.  Graphics are beautiful and zoom is great, it is nice to be able to see the small details, every game should have this zoom.  The story is good and it is just not point and click.  You have to use your brain to figure out what to do and where to go, but then that makes it fun and last a while so you really get your moneys worth.  The remarks made when you are trying different things I find funny.  Great job!
A10LBT4V6Z635U B00C71OUJC 5 1366329600 51 Just started the game and got as far as the girl in the room by guy on floor, when the cop hands me the key to his room the game goes back to the home screen and will go no further.  Got to find out where to get my money back
A10LFICYJTGSII B004UBH4S6 5 1357516800 22 I like how it works and is pretty accurate. :-)  it could work a little differently,  but I'm not complaining about it
A10LFICYJTGSII B0097GVJWQ 5 1366329600 22 the game keeps u interested instantly. great storyline and deep characters. I cant wait to play the second hereon of this game.
A10LFICYJTGSII B0064X7B4A 5 1363132800 20 I like the game it keeps u interested. never get tired of it. always play this game ill love it
A10LFICYJTGSII B00F2UZ2UQ 5 1381190400 73 I've played this game many times on my computer and still love it. if you're a strategist you will love this game. Always put most of your villagers as scientists. only have one farmer to start so that you don't deplete the bush too quickly. if you see a mushroom use a child to get it quickly they give u more food. when you have enough points buy farming first to grow crops
A10LMXN0S1BQUV B0087HT36U 5 1349049600 48 If you like challenging puzzles that are visually pleasing as well as challenging, then you'll love Siege Hero!  You also get a brief visual history of the world through eye catching animated characters while using your brain to save peasants while at the same time defeating the enemy.
A10LMXN0S1BQUV B008194C74 5 1340236800 22 A clever game of cross word type puzzles made out of some of the best, most awesome quotes from well known people!
A10LMXN0S1BQUV B009C7JS14 4 1391817600 40 This App is cool but shows only one day instead of the week.  That's OK if you don't want to know what's going to Happen later in the week.  If it showed a weekly forcast if watch it every day.
A10LMXN0S1BQUV B00IAQ3RJM 5 1402963200 47 I've played many match three games and this is one of my favorite ones to play.  I can get past the levels without feeling like I needed to buy helps which is a HUGE plus and the characters and graphics are cute.  I highly recommend this one!
A10LPCBWAADOSR B008MM9630 5 1358380800 25 This game is so awesome I love it I would play it all the time but the only thing is you run out of energy
A10LPCBWAADOSR B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392076800 33 This is a awesome game and it stinks that the creator of flappy bird took it down but we still have this and there is somthing cool about this game... the bird poops!
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B004DPCSKI 3 1360627200 31 sometimes you get an app that is just for fun and works well this is one of them.  Dont think it really works but it is fun.  I like it thanks
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0094FYBB6 1 1360627200 22 tried it didnt like it and deleted it from not only my kindle but the cloud too.  Not my kind of game.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00768WTXA 5 1392163200 23 I love this game. It is beautiful. It is not so difficult that it is frustrating.  My grandchildren LOVE to play it too.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00ATSAVQG 4 1377388800 29 This game is different from the others. It is challenging and interesting.  Strained glad pictures are beautiful.  I enjoyed the challenge of the puzzles and they progressively got harder.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00AQ398AY 5 1360627200 20 On my Kindle Hd 7 it works.  I have it and avast on my kindle.  seems to work together ok.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B004DLNC4I 5 1360627200 32 I absolutely love this app.  It works amazingly well no matter where we are from West to East coast.  It is informative and helpful.  One of the best apps I have gotten.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00846FBEM 3 1350432000 28 fair for a free app. quite a few interuptions to post on facebook or twitter. needs a hint button. on kindle fire objects are pretty tiny to find.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0067Q42BY 5 1388534400 20 I like this game I do 2 or 3 a day and it helps keep my mind sharp thanks .
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0088Y7YHW 3 1388534400 33 pretty much like all other slot games.  Doesnt keep paying you enough to keep you playing for long.  Ok for a quick game and then to delete when they ask for real money.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006YC74E8 5 1388534400 46 Free camera does a great job.  Only problem was getting the pictures off of it.  Finally found out my computer needed a different driver and  now they are safe on my external hard drive.  I really like it and use it on my kindle fire 7.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B009HUB40Y 1 1388534400 26 this game asked for money to quickly for me so I deleted it to make room for a working app.  so I am not much help.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00HJ30F1U 5 1391126400 22 fun to play game, can go back and play other levels to earn more money to buy helpers with.  I like itl
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B008N8IV2U 1 1377216000 23 Wasted my time getting this game. Not fun didn't work. No explanation of the game, r how or what to do with it.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00BJCLUXO 4 1388534400 24 little kids like it, it keeps them busy for quite a while.  It offers several choices to draw with.  Graphics are cute for kids.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006FKPVHQ 5 1360627200 29 I absolutely love this app.  It works amazingly well doing what I need it to do.  It is number helpful.  One of the best simple apps I have gotten.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0064TVQ5E 4 1365811200 56 I love mahjong games and this is one of the best I have played.  I didn't rate it a five star because after every game there is an add.  But you have to expect that from a free game.  Could make the tiles bigger or pinch in or out.  The music and sound effects are great.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006JPS1OM 4 1360627200 46 sometimes you get an app that is just for fun and works well this is one of them.  I enjoy no brainer games to fill in time when I have to wait, this is a great one for that. Items are very small hard to see.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B004TI2ZXY 3 1360627200 34 I like this app.  It works  well doing what I need it to do. Actually I was hoping to find a GPS when I got this.  It is helpful for preparing for an event.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B008YRVW0I 4 1350518400 27 i have always liked this game.  it is free but you cant win because they want you to buy it to complete it.  free is not truthful.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00D6VP410 1 1388534400 23 this game never worked for me so I deleted it to make room for a working app.  so I am not much help.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00AE6XMHI 1 1388188800 47 This could be a cute game but the never-ending babble of the characters is not funny and does not add to the game. The games and puzzles were cute. I would have purchased the game if it hadn't been for the constant, time consuming, not .funny babble.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B004TI2ZOI 4 1360627200 28 I like this app.  It works amazingly well doing what I need it to do.  It is number helpful.  One of the best simple apps I have gotten
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B008XG1X18 5 1377216000 38 I use this app all of the time. This one contains many tips on how to better use your kindle fire.. But. It is not frustrating hard to follow.  I like pinterest has anything you want to know.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0085YOD1A 5 1372204800 27 Nice app being free helped. I like the large icon showing my battery and the charge it has. Thanks for a great app. The colors are nice.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00CTN0ALA 3 1388534400 47 this game just like all of the others start out pretty cool, but some ask for money sooner than others and this is one.  If I can't play it long enough to see if I really like it I wont buy it.  So this one got deleted.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006HXXJH0 2 1394064000 26 Many of the game s are the same old thing. Luckily they are free so if they are too boring you can delete them. Too small.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00BJ9VBLI 5 1377216000 28 but it is just like any other match 3 game entertaining for a while then they want you to buy the game, lives or something.  Typical game sample.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006Z0KKIG 5 1360627200 25 love mahjong.  I download any of them for the holidays, then i bring the current one out of the clouds when it is that  holiday,.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00BL0I7WG 2 1377216000 36 Fun for a while then just becomes the same old thing. I removed it from my kindle.  As usual need to spend money to play long. I won't pay to play. Objects to small to find.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00EJILIPA 3 1378771200 49 The game could be fun if it was not so dark. Can't see the things you need to click on. Words for hidden object too small.  Always try to make you buy the full version.  What are the stars for?  Fix these problems and it will be worth buying.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B007ZGO7EM 4 1360627200 28 I likethis app.  It works amazingly well doing what I need it to do.  It is helpful for shopping.  One of the best simple apps I have gotten
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B007PT3QOQ 4 1348617600 33 i would have given 5 stars if you could get the green money without actually buying it. and i prefer to finish building without having to involve friends and beg them for stuff.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0091FQNHO 4 1377216000 25 Just like any other match 3 game entertaining for a while then they want you to buy the game, lives or something.  Typical game sample.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B009G9KFQ0 5 1365033600 31 I love the weather applications and this one is a great addition to the others I have. Contains many different choices pertaining to the current as well as the pending weather.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006PJ3UKC 4 1360627200 28 I didn't know I even had this app.  I like usa today and my husband loves it so we will start using it now that I found it.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00BNJGZBK 5 1379030400 40 Great Game great twist to an old idea. I even went on to buy this one. I seldom buy them. Objects were pretty good sized some spots were pretty dark. To play on the small kindle screen went pretty well.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00CRHF748 1 1377216000 24 Could not find it after it supposedly loaded.  Not worth my time to hunt for it. No idea if it is fun or not.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B007TBAQCK 2 1377216000 31 Fun for a while then just becomes the same old thing. I removed it from my kindle.  As usual need to spend money to play long. I won't pay to play.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00820STKI 4 1360627200 31 this is a cool app,.  I put it on my kindle for my grandkids and bring it  from the cloud when they are here.  keeps them occupied. they really like it.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006C4U9RW 5 1388534400 22 great app works well on my kindle fire hd 7, I can listen to about anything I want to for free. cool
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B007HEQIMQ 5 1391126400 34 if you can love a bank app this one is pretty cool.  You can do most of your banking on this app but have to sign in totally to do big stuff.  works ok.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00FAX6XQC 1 1388534400 23 didnt work was to hard to play, had to use two stylus to play .  deleted it to make room for something else.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00E0NWJVG 5 1388534400 23 I like this game I do 2 or 3  times a day and it helps keep my mind and eyes sharp thanks .
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B009S24P7A 5 1351641600 22 This is an awesome app that all grannys should have on their kindle.  love it I grew up with this story.  GREAT.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00A8ECU24 4 1360627200 21 Granddaughters like this app.  Keeps them busy for a while but seems not to have enough action for them. Its ok.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B009V1E8EI 3 1360627200 21 I love hidden object games.  This was a good game but the hidden items were very small and difficult too see.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B004VOJT0I 4 1360627200 23 A good book if you are looking for new recipes.  I like the allrecipes.com website and this app is a great addition.  .
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B0063GORYU 5 1348531200 20 great game. i have had several hours of fun from this game. for a free app its great. try it.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00GNIJAEA 4 1394064000 23 Cute app, need to increase the number of people you can interact with.  Has some cute ideas. Not an app I use regular.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B008LXN9II 1 1350259200 21 I would give no stars if possible. would not open or play. reloaded 4 times.  this app is a big joke.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00869HEJ2 3 1394064000 24 Many of the game s are the same old thing. Luckily they are free so if they are too boring you can delete them.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B005ZISF8Q 1 1353888000 23 I am not pleased with this app.  I cannot even open it to look at it.  Deleated it from my KFhd7.  Very disappointing.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B005EYWT38 5 1360627200 21 Puts me to sleep and that is why I got it.  Cant complain about that, and it has choices of sounds.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00CJ95O2E 5 1377216000 27 I use this daily on my kindle fire hd and it really seems to make a difference. And on top of it all the app was free.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B006QC6YL0 3 1360627200 22 Lacks pictures need pictures for easier use.  A pretty good book for home remedies and it was free.  That is a plus.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00B03IY90 4 1388534400 54 this game just like all of the others start out pretty cool, but some ask for money sooner than others and this is one.  If I can't play it long enough to see if I really like it I wont buy it.Items to find are too small for kindle.  So this one got deleted.
A10LR5LRY9SGI2 B00910Y1OQ 3 1350259200 24 started out pretty cool. then came the pieces with no way to move them. there you set unless you want to start all over.
A10LUEAKM7F8W8 B00A757EFW 5 1388620800 23 One of my favorite games of all time!  This app works very well on my kindle and I would recommend it to anyone.
A10LUEAKM7F8W8 B004TI2ZXY 3 1390003200 25 Had to load it a second time because it stuck in night mode but it is a very good help when looking for a destination.
A10LUEAKM7F8W8 B0065AFQSU 3 1388620800 21 This app is not really meant for the kindle tablet.  It is a google app and is somewhat hard to use!
A10LUEAKM7F8W8 B004SIIBGU 3 1388620800 24 It is a little harder to use then on a desktop but I was able to get around ok and get the job done!
A10LVWR95Y7H2E B00ESCOI7C 5 1380326400 20 A great way to challenge your self while spending time. I love playing this while traveling. overall a great game
A10LVWR95Y7H2E B00BMH4GQE 4 1367107200 20 I like playing these types of games in my free time, overall good game, really fun for terns to play.
A10LVWR95Y7H2E B00BG3ID0Y 4 1367107200 21 I like to play this game in my free time, tons of fun word puzzles to figure out. overall good game.
A10LVWR95Y7H2E B0063GORYU 5 1339891200 19 I love this game and I was not able to put it down ever since I got it!love it!
A10LVWR95Y7H2E B004K56MNU 5 1345852800 34 love it!  now insted of reading my  wattpad books on the small screen of my ipod i can read on here and the text is bigger so it dose not mess with my eyes.
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B004KU2JZU 5 1325203200 110 This app is the best I've seen for Solitaire! There are so many games to choose from, and the instructions are clear enough that it's easy to learn new games. I bought the paid version to support development because it's that awesome. The only things I would change would be to have the option to change the color of the face of the cards (white is too bright when playing in the dark) and to have a color-picker option for the table &amp; card backs. There are a lot of nice choices already included for table &amp; backs. This one is just me wanting that perfect shade of purple. :)
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B004WPG1A2 4 1321142400 31 Everything works well on my Dinc2. Minus one star because the sound turns back on every time I pause or exit the game - prohibits playing while someone else is sleeping.
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B006XIR9KM 5 1334880000 58 It's worth downloading to see if you like it. I don't like how the tiles move around on their own because I have a tough enough time remembering where they were to begin with, but I'm sure a lot of people will love the extra challenge. The game works well, and exits properly. It's definitely worth checking out!
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B0066T0BTO 5 1325116800 50 This is an excellent version of Bejeweled 2. If you are looking for a different game (Blitz, etc.) look elsewhere. If you want the original B2, you won't find a better one out there. The knockoffs just don't compare. This game is beautiful &amp; works perfectly on the HTC Dinc2.
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B0066T8M1I 5 1325116800 90 This is a fabulous game! I like that I can set different house rules &amp; it has all the features of playing the real game as will as some cute animations. There are a few minor differences from the board game, but mine is several years old so they may be accurate for the latest versions. For instance, Mediterranean &amp; Baltic are brown instead of purple and Luxury Tax is $100 instead of $75. Nothing that really affects game play. This is the best electronic version of Monopoly ever created!!!
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B0057B1C90 4 1325116800 36 This game has some odd quirks in the physics, but is enjoyable to play anyway. I throw a backup ball, so it's more like real bowling for me than for all of the fingertippers out there.
A10LWRQK3RF8A7 B0051HNMTI 5 1330560000 55 You can choose the length of the workout &amp; the app divides the time and speaks the name of the next exercise when it's time to switch.Brian &amp; Matthew:If you were that sexy, you wouldn't have time to sit around &amp; wait to downrate the FAOTD every night. Oops! Ya'all gave yourselves away. Delta Alphas!
A10LX1PB8U94LM B00EBQRSTK 4 1405900800 55 This is a nice little game, it seems to go along with all of these easy words as the solution to the puzzle. Then they throw in some off the wall answer and it will make the game interesting (or you will spend a lot of coins). It just depends on how patient you are.
A10LX1PB8U94LM B00FOW265Q 4 1405900800 25 I liked this game, it is fun and just hard enough to keep me interested. It will be great for waiting rooms and the like.
A10LX1PB8U94LM B006RM6JCI 4 1391904000 31 I liked the game,it was a nice change from the usual games and puzzles I play.What I did not like,was the requirement to review or rate it to access more puzzles.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B009ZZDNT6 3 1368662400 28 Worked at first then it started to go off at the wrong time. It was ok T first but it started to act up so I deleted it.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00AOA9BL0 3 1379635200 59 It's has bad volume on my kindle fire, you can hardly hear it unless you're alone and quite. Also it starts to work for a bit then when I press a video to watch it starts to load until it goes back to the search screen and says that this video can't be played and there was an error.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00BW08XRO 4 1379721600 31 I  love this app it's a lot of fun and challenging. I like how the customers come faster after every level and how we get different recipes to make. Great game.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00EGY1WN0 4 1381795200 20 I like this app I just wish we had more to choose from and that all the books were free.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00AREIAI8 4 1376179200 23 I love this app it's so feel. You can train,feed,groom,and much more with your horse. I recommend it to everyone who loves horses.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00A9JG6RS 4 1371513600 35 This game is so much fun. I wouldn't mind playing all day. The only problem is that this game has pop ups. They can be really annoying, but other than that this app is cool.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B0062BYUJ8 4 1369958400 28 I love the backgrounds they're so peaceful. I could listen to this app all day. Also very good at releasing your stress. I love this app soooo much.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00FAPF5U0 4 1386979200 35 I love this game the levels are challenging and fun I just wish that we could get more lives instead of  just five. I recommend this app to everyone who loves a challenge and mazes.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B007U7BIO8 3 1364428800 21 It's good but Sometimes it seems not to work on my kindle fire. But other than that it's a good alarm
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00B7Y0206 3 1374537600 46 I like this app a lot the only problem is that some of the videos won't work on my kindle. Other than I don't have any other problems so far. It's also good because the screen is very clear. Not bad of an app at all.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B008NCUFYS 5 1364601600 20 This game is so much fun I recommend it to everyone and every age. So try it out for yourself
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00C149WAM 2 1373328000 51 Don't get me wrong, I want to use this app soooo much, but you can't unless you have an e-mail address. You HAVE to sign up for the dumb book thing just so you can get a password for this app. If you don't you can't even get in. Big disappointment.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00G357N92 4 1385424000 23 I love this game as well as the first one. I love all the new recipes. I recommend this app to everyone :)
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00BM8UNUQ 4 1370044800 46 I love these kind of games. This game is as fun as all of the other dash games with these characters in them. I also recommend to those who haven't tried any other games like this, then try dinner dash. This game is so much fun.
A10M2B1HHYOSKB B00CJ77HU8 4 1372636800 76 I love this game I play with my little stepbrother all the time it's kinda our way of bonding time. Funny part is when I was playing with him on this game today it said No More Moves three times in a row and we didn't even have time to make a move. We both burst out laughing. All in all this game has lots of boards to beat and I'm sure that you'll have fun.
A10M2FW0K7R0YN B00CKW6FVE 5 1386028800 35 The changes and additions made to this game really enhance the game play. I find it much more enjoyable and entertaining than the original version. The only drawback is that it's so much more addictive.
A10M2FW0K7R0YN B00E5GJ7QS 5 1389139200 24 This game is fun and simple enough for my special needs daughter. She is loving it. Easy yet a bit of a challenge, too.
A10M2FW0K7R0YN B00AMEFZ72 4 1389571200 23 Nice combination of features. Not just your typical bingo game. Easy to navigate and play. My daughter is having a blast with it.
A10M2FW0K7R0YN B00CMF27DE 5 1391126400 25 Great little game. Plays fast and easy. The excellent detail in the illustrations of the cats at rest and play just add to the enjoyment.
A10M2FW0K7R0YN B00DT4GRTM 5 1391472000 41 This is a nice little game. We all enjoy playing it each day. It has some nice features and variations that make it stand out from the others like it. I do wish we got more daily chips an bigger rewards.
A10M2JG95HHM1R B004WGGQPQ 5 1329004800 49 well this app is the best.  i love it.  It has a lot of colers and marcers,crans,pait,and colered penciles. Amazing app love it.  you shoukd get it.  also you can save your your pics into a booklet that u can print.  i lobe this app tortaly love it. :-)

Insted of  telling you things I dont like I will tell you things I do like.# one i LOVE that there are no add at the end of the game.# tow I also love that there are some funny things in the game. So its not boreing. #three is that its fun and you never get bord of the game.You NEED to get this game NOW.
A10M2JG95HHM1R B004O9G750 2 1324512000 76 well i like this game but theres a couple problems with it. My first problem with it  dosent always aim where you want it to aim I thinck that the creater really needs to fix that right away. My secent problem with this game is that i got stuck on level 100. Now im not saying its bad to make levels hard but it is bad to make levels  TO hard level 100 is TO hard.
A10M2JG95HHM1R B009UX2YAC 4 1359158400 79 Wow I have to say t ha t I was and still am addicted to subway surfer ! It is Great how you can unlock a bunch of things , you can unlock huge mystery boxes with millions and millions of coins ! Multiple people to choose from and play with ! My only issue with this game is that it  is so expense to buy things ! THANCKS for readingHi I'm jazzy and this is jazzy reviews !########
A10M30ZEKY25VZ B006D1ONE4 5 1322352000 46 This game has the same easy pick up and play quality as Angry Birds but makes you do a lil more thinking to solve the puzzles. Difficulty starts off easy but works its way up gradually to offer some real challenges. Be warned, its HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!!
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B0092KDEGG 4 1370131200 74 Originally  I  felt stupid , like I just  couldn't figure what I was missing .  Then it finally hit me  everything you need is right In front of you. The 1st room was easy but as you progress you just need to proceed right there.  The only problem was at 1st all clues were in Chinese , I could not find any instructions.  You just  need to go to settings and find your flag.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B009KS4XRO 2 1400976000 21 Didn't like it that much . I found it confusing at times . I like Bingo but this was also boring.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00ATPVA78 4 1377129600 43 I am enjoying this game so far. It is not to hard yet if you like puzzles you should enjoy this game. The only thing is that they say it is free yet you have to purchase the game after a short trail.Brendaimpson@Yahoo
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00FEMJF6O 4 1402099200 23 Like it lot just very time consuming. Quest can come too many at a time and for levels your not even close to.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1404604800 34 Very difficult for those that don't like a challenge.  If you tend to like a challenge then this is the game for you the only trouble is no hints without purchasing the full version.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B008PB2ZVI 4 1395446400 34 Like this alot.  At time every straight forward and others ,I need all the help I can got.  My only problem is the stupid ads that creep up in the middle of the solutions.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00CT9ZVGI 5 1382400000 22 Lots of fun with some puzzles that at times seem impossible. I had at times needed to just walk away and regroup.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00IYOACQ6 5 1402790400 27 Enjoyed all very challenging but you have access to hints just would enjoy more levels. I have tried others and they were not as much fun .
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00881VLCE 4 1402790400 27 I have looked at other jigsaw puzzle apps and find that this is by far the best  I purchased the bundle but am having trouble finding it.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B0064X7FVE 1 1376092800 35 The old app was fine,  Don't know why you changed it.  I want the old format back!  Ya it had some problems but it was still better then the crap you have you have now.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00E78QIDE 3 1403827200 26 Fun and hard makes you think outside of the box . State the less obvious.  Very nerve racking most of the yet challenges you to think.
A10M3V9SOAOB55 B00AA87JGU 4 1370476800 43 I really like this game a lot. The only problems are the coins you start with don't , last to purchase only two hints . The other is the little saying between rooms goes to fast you don't  have time to read them.
A10M5YGW2KPUEY B004RCD7NY 5 1337558400 23 I can't believe this was free. the interface is very nice to use. extremely easy and well integration with wikipedia is great. thanks
A10M5YGW2KPUEY B004SYIA1U 5 1313107200 21 I love this app. my kids sit entranced listening to the shadow. and superman. this IS a captivating and lovely app.
A10M5YGW2KPUEY B004SBS8LA 5 1301616000 26 this game is so much fun . I can't believe it was free. the birds make funny sounds and fly away when you save them .
A10M5YGW2KPUEY B004SCQABY 5 1301702400 35 this game is so much fun. it will provide you with many hours of fun. I like the music and different airfield choices. the helicopters are a pain and they give you a good challenge.
A10M5YGW2KPUEY B004VOJT0I 5 1309305600 43 THIS APP IS WONDERFUL. I LOVE HOW YOU CAN CHOOSE THE MEAL THE TYPE OF MEAT OR FOOD GROUP. OR JUST SHAKE PHONE TO RANDOMLY SELECT A MEAL. I USE THIS TO COOK GREAT MEALS . THANKS GUYS. GREAT APP. GREAT GREAT GREAT
A10M5YGW2KPUEY B004SRLB1I 4 1301788800 31 this is a cute app for kids. the cat records you talking and repeats it like a parrott.  I like knocking the cat out! you can pet it and it purr.
A10M6AV180YYIU B007PW1BZY 4 1334016000 42 I have always loved phase 10 and used to play it all the time with friends. this app is exactly what it should if you like this card game.  the only thing missing in my opinion is the ability to play multiplayer
A10M6AV180YYIU B00E4WVYR8 5 1381276800 64 I wasn't going to download this game because it sounded boring to me.... blend the colors, yawn. But it had such great reviews and I was bored so I gave it a shot. I'm officially hooked. It's a simple puzzle concept with colors but it gets more challenging as you go along. Fast paced fun.... I might be up half the night playing now.
A10M6AV180YYIU B00BS3UFCQ 5 1366156800 27 A fun, addictive game. Challenging enough for it to take a long time to guess them all but with enough easy ones to keep from getting frustrated.
A10M94ASQEBL56 B005AKD836 5 1359763200 22 I like that I can use it from PC, smartphone or kindle and easily update status, check friend's status, and rate books.
A10M94ASQEBL56 B004TTY694 3 1361145600 46 This app sets the title of the note automatically.  Then afterwards you can edit the content of the note but not the title.  Thus some notes have confusing titles.  If they made the note title editable I would give it a 5.  Good for taking notes.
A10M94ASQEBL56 B00G5LQ5MU 3 1391126400 26 I enjoyed the levels I was able to play.  Very well done and creative.  Was looking forward to a couple of weeks of good, challenging levels.
A10MA9GT66YY24 B00CWY76CC 5 1375142400 24 LOVE the challenge!!!! Really makes you use your brain!!!! Would definitely suggest this app for everybody that enjoys a good rack your brain challenge.
A10MA9GT66YY24 B00DLJ31HQ 5 1382227200 26 Very challenging and great for the kids to interact with you to guess what the pics are. Absolutely love this app, would recommend this for everyone
A10MA9GT66YY24 B00D5YT6IA 5 1389916800 20 This game is very challenging and i would definitely suggest that you get it,the greatest thing is that it's free.
A10MBGAK94GJ1N B00BNH1PF8 1 1363392000 57 Rating this cuz it is the only way without using actual money to get past the first couple of puzzles!  I will review again later once I see how it works after this!Ahh now I see!  And it's FUN.  Ads are tiny at the bottom of screen and once I got started playing I couldn't hardly stop!
A10MBGAK94GJ1N B0063IH60K 5 1360713600 70 Great version of an old favorite.  Just as addictive as Windows version. LOTS of choices of decks, tables etc. Easy to use and fun to play.  EDIT after having this game for about a month I'm pretty frustrated that I can't get my win percentage much over 11percent, nor my average time (regular scoring/draw 3)much under 1min 50secs.  I'm REALLY good at "e solitaire" but not this one so much!
A10MBGAK94GJ1N B009G9KFQ0 4 1360627200 33 I like this program a lot. Easy interface easy to keep several areas in memory so I can check  my weather and then with just a tap check my son's 2500 miles away
A10MBGAK94GJ1N B004DLNC4I 4 1367020800 46 Curiosity made me get this!  I enjoy turning on my Kindle Fire when I hear sirens in my small town to hear what's going on!  I always hear folks talking about what they heard &#34;on the scanner&#34; and now I know why!  Ads are very nonobtrusive
A10MBGAK94GJ1N B008Y7SMQU 4 1360108800 31 Great alone or with friends to test both brain power and the power of advertising!  Worth the download. LOTS of pop ups at first tho. Easy to earn tips are great
A10MDBF6K01VT B00CWY76CC 5 1391299200 22 This is a great it makes you think. I recommend that everyone play this game, it is great fun for your brain.
A10MDBF6K01VT B00AHNC0SK 5 1393891200 24 Better than the Simpson's if you ask me and the best part is that you get to interact with the rides it is awesome.
A10MDBF6K01VT B00DYY92MG 5 1391126400 20 I can't believe that I can remember some of theses shows. It really brings back some great memories; great game
A10MDBF6K01VT B00CEBKMN8 5 1389744000 32 Great game loads of fun, really passes the time. I have never been good with the quarter games in stores; but this game is enjoyable and easy to progress on thank you.
A10MDBF6K01VT B00HJ4G1MQ 5 1390953600 23 The graphics are great and the game is easy enough to use and not get lost great game it's a lot of fun
A10MDBF6K01VT B00HCMG6LG 5 1391299200 20 This game is just as fun as the first game it makes you think, we want more levels thank you
A10MDBF6K01VT B00IKZX1ZI 5 1404345600 22 We love this game my girls are loving this game, they play every day with out fail thanks for my kids enjoyment.
A10MFAH9W1B5R2 B00DJYC55C 5 1395446400 37 This app is amazing !! But she can be fighsty she calls me Kesha and I pretend I am a cat and we share secrets please  make a Angela that grows up just like the Tom one
A10MFAH9W1B5R2 B00A8ECU24 4 1399075200 32 I love this game so much. But the price for one fun**in pony is ridiculous seriouslyAn I hate my little pony [ baloney ] and try it it's great !! Smooches !
A10MFAH9W1B5R2 B00JFYY2OC 5 1401148800 33 I'm stuck on level 10 this game is hard but I like it and I  really need help I beg somebody to help me seriously I need help XOXO to whoever helps me
A10MMUVPONJ0Z1 B006MHWXMS 4 1328140800 39 Great app although I wish it could incorporate my phone book for call reminders and allow me to dial straight from the app as oppose to closing and looking up # and then dialing hope to see in update
A10MMUVPONJ0Z1 B0055S348W 5 1316131200 51 I've tried others and sadly big disappointment but since this was free I said what the heck worth a try...OMG is all I can say works Perfect on both phone ( thunderbolt) and tablet(Xoom) this had to be the best free app ever offered by Amazon thank you to both parties
A10MMUVPONJ0Z1 B004X80QNG 4 1323216000 26 Beautiful interface.  ease of use. have it on my xoom and thunderbolt and works great however needs widget.  hopefully future update will include.  job well done
A10MMUVPONJ0Z1 B004QOP62S 4 1320796800 23 Its decent not enough to Facebook about. its just like text twist.,..wouldn't pay 2 bucks for it but its a good free game
A10MO6SWEYJQ3F B00FAPF5U0 5 1403481600 65 For all of you who rated it a 1 and said, its a scam for money and its sucky how you have to buy lives. You don't!! Do something else with you life without sitting of your kindle watching thr time til you get a life back. You either get off your butt and do something while you wait or waste you money. Your choice
A10MRIEXG2UVOL B0075ASHQM 5 1376956800 22 Fun for trivia buffs! We enjoyed testing each other with the items in this book. Being able to randomize was really cool.
A10MRIEXG2UVOL B00DWZ3S90 4 1396483200 23 This a great game. It becomes addictive. You may want to set a timer, if you only have a limited time to play!
A10MRIEXG2UVOL B00CPPXYC4 5 1405036800 20 This game is fun for all ages. My grandson likes it as much as I do. Cute graphics as well.
A10MROYW806BUC B00AE9UYJ4 3 1371772800 28 First it's not scary at all second is he doesn't do anything to kill you so to be honest I think that this is the worst slender yet
A10MROYW806BUC B005ZXWMUS 1 1369526400 23 My fav spongebob show just got took off from the whole netflix  you need to put it on  again now I hate it
A10MROYW806BUC B009HKL4B8 5 1359590400 21 Awesome game you did a great job with I give it 5 stars love it so much  it's very fun game
A10MVE2MEOU6XT B007PW1BRC 5 1339027200 37 I haven't played Phase 10 before, this was a good test.  99 cents isn't outrageous, but I love to test before I buy.  Especially with these aps. I will spend the dollar, and play the real thing.
A10MVE2MEOU6XT B008MEM24S 5 1347926400 75 If you played &quot;Where's My Water?&quot; you will know how this works. If you haven't then after you conquer this game, then I suggest that game next.  This is a cute puzzle game with some entertaining characters. The 300 levels plus bonus levels should keep you busy for a while. Somehow the developers manage to find new things for every level.A great game from Disney. Thank you for finally giving me another game to play!
A10MVE2MEOU6XT B006GIX2MI 5 1334534400 41 This is a fun time, resource, money management ap.  Inhabe opened it on the computernand this translates well to the tablet.  If it is as much fun as the computer version you will get your money's. worth out of this one.
A10MVE2MEOU6XT B008Y2FRFO 3 1349222400 52 Will drain your patience, your time, AND your wallet because you (or your child)  can purchase coins in multiples. You can earn points very slowly while offline, slightly faster while online, and turtle slow while playing.  Three stars for realism. A removal from my device for being a drain on the pocketbook.
A10MVE2MEOU6XT B006OOHYIC 4 1335139200 43 Lovely graphics,  relaxing music.  Challenging game,  with enough hints to keep you from getting frustrated.  The main downfalll is the nagging to leave a review,  even on the apaid version. Thus the deduction in stars. Almost annoying enough to make it 3 stars.
A10MWN6JRRU4IR B00BG3ID0Y 4 1367539200 24 Some words are hard and others are pretty easy.  Can collect coins fairly easy which on wtw 2, you can't.  Highly addictive.  Would recommend.
A10MWN6JRRU4IR B0088Y7YHW 4 1346976000 28 The only problem I have is that the credits go quickly.  You either have to wait or buy more :( to play for any significant amount of time.
A10MX7UVT3TR1D B00BN6K97Y 3 1403395200 27 Great app but the only downside is that it's pay outs  are small graphics are awesome and addictive this app gets a 3 out of 5 starsI
A10N1VAIY8XD4Q B009KS4XRO 4 1379980800 21 I tried it yesterday and it is addicting, I accidently forgot to start supper I was so intrigued with this game
A10N1VAIY8XD4Q B00ED4TX2A 5 1379980800 26 I have this on my computer too, it is a little different , so I am stuck on a part of it when playing my kindle
A10N1VAIY8XD4Q B004SJ3BCI 3 1379980800 20 I am not sure what the object of this game is  and it is very confusing knowing what to do
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00J3AW23G 5 1400025600 40 This puzzle game is fun. It's challenging and thought provoking. I've been playing for a couple of days and not once has this app asked for money . I find that refreshing.  Thumbs up to the Oak Team. THANK YOU!!!
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00E8KLWB4 1 1391990400 58 I like hidden object games BUT I HATE hidden object games WITH TIME CONSTRAINTS . I have been playing for enough time to have made a few levels but I find myself FAILING FAR MORE OFTEN than I succeed.  With that thought in mind, I'veremoved this app from my device so I won't spend a moment more frustrated.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B009S980KG 1 1384128000 78 I`'ve been playing for two weeks and this game is Impossible. The goals don't bring in enough coins . The buildings, expansions, and upgrades cost too much.  And even when you spend the coins and then wait the required time for the upgrade then you find out you need items that your planes MIGHT drop IF you've flown to the right destinations before you can actually finish and get the upgrade`s benefit.  I QUIT.  I recommend Never Playing.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00GTCECVG 1 1394323200 139 I played this app for a week and I was attacked by other players DAILY. You can't stop the attacks and you lose ALOT of your resources from each attack. If you are attacked by more than one player you lose all your resources that day .  There isn't any way to protect your resources from this and with no resources you can't build. You have to have a lot of resources to build up but the more you have the more you lose in the attacks. I got tired of almost having enough to build and then watching someone attacking and seeing it all taken away.  If this kind of frustration is your cup of tea then by all means play, but if you find this as frustrating as I did then stay FAR AWAY FROM THIS APP.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00CTQ6SIG 4 1381363200 26 This is a great way to spend some funny time. I love ordering around the Simpson cast. They usually make funny comments when you tap them.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00ESNW58K 1 1398729600 73 I despise time limits, especially ones that then push in app purchases to overcome the limits. Dangling pretty things that you can't possibly get without the use of a commodity earned very slowly, if at all, but easily purchased for &quot;Just a few REAL WORLD DOLLARS&quot; is annoying and I refuse. Cute app but far too much of the pushing for money.  I quit.  It got one star became I can't give less.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B0067Q42BY 5 1378166400 32 I've been playing for a couple of days and I haven't seen the supposed bombardment of advertising others have complained about. The app is interesting, fun and mildly challenging.  I`m enjoying it.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00KWVZ750 3 1404345600 36 This game is cute but it is some what annoying. It is not always easy to figure out how to do things. Also there is a LOT of advertising in the game that you can't avoid.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00IZMQ8G0 3 1398038400 37 This game is fun but the categories don't mean that the questions are related.  I don't think questions about space or Popeye the sailor belong in the stone age category. In this regard the game is annoying.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B007NACZPI 1 1370304000 748 I bought Tiny Village for my Kindle Fire in December of 2012 and started playing. I liked what I saw and played often. However when I had a problem with the app the TinyCo support was unable to correct the problem, blaming me for the error and saying I asked for the item I didnt purchase using the for real world money Crystles. I supose I should have seen the lousy support answer as a red flag but I was enjoying the game so I continued to play. A month later I started a goal set that again caused me to be angry at the TinyCo support because goal 10 of 11 required that you spend the special "Friend" tokens only gotten from haveing friends play the game with you... I prefer to play alone so had none of these tokens and there for felt that I had wasted my time and efforts to do an Unfinishable goal. And now the final straw ( third time is the charm, right!), My Kindle Fire had a catastrophic failure out of the blue, It refused to power up. Now I had no idea that I would be walking into a hornets nest of worthless emails with thier Tech support. I was unaware that the game was what they call 'Device Specific' meaning that it would only play on This particular Kindle and no other with out thier help transfering it and that somewhere in my now Dead Kindle was a TinyCo Id which I had no idea existed and because my kindle would not power up had no way to retreave till I wrote them asking for the transfer to my new Kindle. Amazon was kind enought to replace my old one with a referbished like new kindle Fire but they couldnt transfer my game as only TinyCo could do that. I wrote TinyCo to have this seemly simple thing done and was asked for the TinyCo Id that was attached to my old kindle... Information I told them I didnt have because I didnt know I even HAD a TinyCo Id. Then in an email I was told they could find my game if I gave them the udid for my old kindle and my new kindle prompting my first email to Amazon who happily provided the info for the one sent back and telling me where on my new Fire I could find its UDID... I sent this info to TinyCo and was again told my game could not be found because the UDIDs didnt match any thing they had in thier Data Base and was again asked for the TinyCo Id. I again stated I didnt have the TinyCo Id as the original kindle had failed and then was told if I had the MAC address for both machines they could find it.  I again emailed Amazon and they again were happy to help me with the old machine's MAC and how to find it in the new machine. I sent this info to TinyCo's support with bated breath ( I had now been out of my Game for 13 days, 6 of those days being lost to the time the kindle fire died and the time it took to get the new one as it was over the Memorial Day weekend).  I then got an email back from the TinyCo support stating they could not match my numbers to any thing in thier Tiny Monsters game and that they were sorry for thier inability to find and transfer my game.  I wrote them back 'But Im not playing Tiny Monsters, I play Tiny Village'. Then waited again for a whole day for them to respond with 'if I give them the TinyCo Id from the old machine and the TinyCo id from the new machine they would be happy to transfer my game otherwise they could Not find my game.' So for all intenents and purposes my game died when My original Fire died and they have jerked me around for over a week with nonsense about how they could help if I just had this one piece of info or that one piece of info ...all the while knowing that they couldnt help me... I am mad enought to chew nails and spit out rivits. This is the second online game company that has managed to turn what was a fun game into a nightmare and I would NOT recommend this company to any one.
A10N2AP8ZCRT0U B00CO6TOBY 5 1381017600 33 I like the one touch option. It makes the game fast paced but you still have a lot of options. I have been playing around with it and I am still having fun.
A10N6HCRN4Y3WU B00E8KLWB4 5 1391817600 29 I have only played for an hour now but it has been fun so far. Good graphics no issues as of yet. Very enjoyable way to spend the afternoon.
A10N6HCRN4Y3WU B008VRQNIC 5 1356220800 29 best hidden object I've played in a long time. good graphics excellent story line and few glitches. so far it's not a limited trail like most free games are.
A10N6HCRN4Y3WU B0091REZMW 3 1402617600 36 Fun so far not very challenging but I'm only on the first  floor. Although the graphics are great the story is very familiar and I don't like games that make you rate them to continue .
A10N6HCRN4Y3WU B008YSWKLW 3 1359849600 58 Fun at first but not so much when you get weird categories with ridiculously obscure answers that don't even make sense when they are correct. it's frustrating to lose and have to wait so long to try again unless you want to pay cash. But I still didn't delete it, guess it is good to have a challenge.
A10N6KHUJRCWCC B0064TVQ5E 5 1374796800 27 Great for when I'm totally bored, or just want to challenge myself in a times game. Fun, great graphics, I really enjoy this game! And it's free!
A10N6KHUJRCWCC B00AP9U8SA 5 1358640000 21 Passes the time! I enjoy dress up / makeover games, so if you do too this one is simple and fun
A10N83ZI8AYVJJ B008BM3TKM 5 1345420800 32 This game has it all!! A few hidden object screens. Challenging puzzles and an intriguing storyline. The sounds and music are Zen like. Very well done. Buy it. You wont be disappointed.
A10N83ZI8AYVJJ B0085CEBGY 4 1341014400 21 love the zany worlds. great art work.  not real difficult but some items are challenging to find. well worth 99 cents
A10N8CLBZ4FX8H B006M4F67A 5 1368748800 22 I thoroughly enjoy this one as it has more choices then previous ones I've purchased!! Can become addicting to say the least.
A10N8CLBZ4FX8H B00KOEHQCW 5 1403568000 33 I love all the free fall games. The music for this one goes so well for the movie and the game. First levels were pretty easy, but it's getting more and more challenging.
A10N8FGSO80FMP B008LXN9II 1 1344729600 22 Would like to try this but can't. Installed twice but did not open. This is for a motarola cliq 2. Please update.
A10N8FGSO80FMP B008VRQNIC 1 1347667200 21 Installed but does not run. When it starts you get the image but then out shuts down. Will try to reinstall.
A10N8FGSO80FMP B007K8RFJ4 5 1388448000 41 My kids lose the remote all the time, we ave this installed on both kindles, the cell phone, and my laptop, this is a life saver, oh and it is fun to mess with them when they have the remote, LOL

A10NMC8EO56OHC B007OXASB2 5 1333929600 21 if you're an animal fanatic like I am,  than this game is for you.its a great little game for all ages.
A10NRD526P82M B00DJFIMW6 5 1391644800 49 This app is flat out amazing, but every single device has the new AVL update with an awesome new mini game. But the Kindle Fire HDX and Kindles everywhere don't have the chance to experience the amazing new experience that Despicable Me: Minion Rush has to offer. Please fix.
A10NRD526P82M B00KOEHQCW 5 1403136000 45 This app was so awesome and I think they should make more free fall apps off of there hit moves, like Frankenweenie, Monsters University, and maybe Gravity Falls. But anyway, This app is so amazing, and if you didn't already downloaded it, get it Asap!
A10NRD526P82M B00H51RUZK 5 1392508800 26 I love this app! This is the best substitution for Google's Youtube. I would totally suggest downloading this great app if you don't already have it.
A10NRFR186HE1R B008V06NRU 1 1364083200 39 This app really has no point,I think it's kinda dumb.That's why it is free.I was glad it didn't cost $0.99.I'm sorry I messed up the ratings.But it's stupid!Don't waste time downloading it like I did.Just don'tdownload the crap people!
A10NRFR186HE1R B0067VKQLE 5 1362787200 24 THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!You really need to get thisapp.It is very addictive and fun.Great for passing time by.A NEED TO DOWNLOAD GAME!
A10NRFR186HE1R B00AIUUXHC 5 1366070400 32 This is the best app for passing time,it has very great graphics and is SO addicting!Hey,you guys REALLY need to try this app.IT IS SO AWESOME!I loved the app,SO YOU SHOULD TO!!!!!!
A10NW6XDIGWTFA B006VFNUEG 1 1402272000 36 This was a nice concept, but it did not work for me.  The choices for cities  was limited to major metropolitan cities and even though it found my town,  the app could not  get any news.
A10NW6XDIGWTFA B007SYWFRM 5 1336867200 74 I was glad to see that this is a free game but don't be fooled.  There is still plenty to pay for. if you want to play the game completely.  I still enjoy the game every day and I do not spend extra money.  This game is on a timer sort of so if you are hatching a baby you need to get back to it before it runs away.  There is no pause.
A10NW6XDIGWTFA B00BWBHIUG 5 1393545600 119 I have polyester fish apps on my Kindle where the fish are realistic and the game tells you about habitats and certain types of fish, but Nemo'sReef does all that and more.  The information one needs to build a great reef stays on the screen in the form of Nemo, Dory, and Ray. You can access the information any time by clicking on the characters.  I like this feature a lot because I can't remember it all in my head.  This game is easy enough for young children, yet has enough detail and challenges for all ages. The game has a nice calming effect as well.  Nemo's Reef works well on the Kindle fire, Kindle HD, and Kindle HDX8.9.
A10NW6XDIGWTFA B0055SWM08 5 1334361600 29 I like puzzle games that make you think so this one is a real winner for me.  I have it on my Kindle Fire. and it works very well.
A10NYZV54E07KL B008DYK0I2 3 1364515200 21 If i used this app more I would rate higher but don't use enough to make a fair review of it
A10NYZV54E07KL B0064X7FVE 5 1364515200 25 This app is just like what I have on my wifes laptop and it rules when I want to know the weather I go there
A10NYZV54E07KL B004TI2ZXY 3 1364515200 24 If I had used this app even once I might be able better review this app but I have not so I can not

A10O68CYWTV49O B007BTE2F2 3 1347494400 38 Its alright but I needed something more. It is pretty basic and I don't use it any more. It is a simple and a cost effective way to study anatomy but I would recommend Anatronica 3D anatomy more.
A10O68CYWTV49O B00A13BI7U 1 1367280000 43 When we downloaded this app we didn't realize that it was more like Farmville. Its not really a kids game and its mostly just annoying. But if you are looking for a &#34;farmville&#34; type game than this might be right up your alley.
A10O68CYWTV49O B00ARRDTX6 4 1367280000 30 Its fun and cute but very basic. My daughter enjoys it but gets bored with it fairly quickly. Its a great thing to keep her occupied for a few minutes.
A10O68CYWTV49O B009S984J8 5 1367280000 50 This is age appropriate for my 4 yr old daughter. Its simple to navigate and has various interactive scenes. Its not a really a game per se so my daughter sometimes gets bored with it but it keeps her busy and she loves to put stickers on all the scenes.
A10O68CYWTV49O B0080JJLBW 5 1367280000 50 My daughter loves this Dora app. Its age appropriate for her to learn and feel challenged without being too easy or too difficult. She loves typing her name at the beginning. This was worth the price but we wish there were some add ons or additional levels she could do.
A10O68CYWTV49O B008JGSM6G 5 1343952000 26 so I got this game for myself but my 4 yr old has taken it over. its kind of crazy how good she is at it.
A10OCDFZTB3QLJ B00A4KVFLY 5 1379116800 19 Love this game! Has made me think about all kinds of things again!Love this app on my Kindle fire!
A10OCDFZTB3QLJ B00AMEFZ72 3 1380412800 23 It is ok not enough bingos, not enough free stuff. But it is fun. I don't like having to share everything with bingo.
A10OCDFZTB3QLJ B00CMF27DE 5 1380672000 25 It is a fun bingo game! Wish it had more prizes. Cats are really cute! Fast paced! I will tell my friends about this app
A10OD272NYM9BQ B00HHBXYGM 5 1395100800 20 Originally got it for my mom to play while at the nursing home, now she says it all the time.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B008P1EWIM 4 1395446400 130 Unfortunately I couldn't test it for too long because it keeps crashing. I can't even set it as a live wallpaper without it crashing. I'm not sure if it's because this is the kindle fire edition and I'm not using it on a kindle fire but I haven't had any problems with other apps that day they are made for kindle. As much as I can't stand the go developers I'll stick with go weather for now, mainly for the weather share camera and I do love customisable themes. I hope this developer looks into a weather sharing camera to go with this app. It really is a pretty app and from what I can tell from the purview the widgets look really good. I wish I could use them.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00EEL0LGY 5 1395532800 91 The graphics &amp; audio is really good, the controls are good and it plays really smooth, and the concept is like any other racing game. For a game with such good graphics it really doesn't use up too much space and it doesn't have extra files to download via Wi-Fi so that's a huge plus. If you like racing games I think you'll like this one. It is pretty fast paced. I would like more ways to do different stunts but maybe I haven't played enough to figure out more stunts.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00821L076 4 1342310400 147 I like to play rollercoaster creator on the computer and there are quite a few of the games ported for Android by various developers but they all suck &amp; they all have ridiculous ads so this rollercoaster game (IMO) isn't exactly the closest thing to the game I like playing on my computer but I think it's by far the best alternative cuz the controls actually work &amp; don't lag like the other games &amp; of course you don't have to worry about push ads or any other kinds of ads with this game. It's not exactly like rollercoaster creator cuz the tracks are already made &amp; look all 3D but the end part is the same where you control the speed to make the passengers happy or die &amp; your score is based on how good you controlled the ride &amp; keep the riders happy :-)
A10OEBNZKX48KU B004YWUV40 5 1320624000 47 i love the idea of having melring android depending on battery and i love the android avatar guy but i thought the wallpaper would be cuter or not so boring, maybe more colors or something! pther than that its cool &amp;its really in sync with the battery!
A10OEBNZKX48KU B004OZOTSQ 5 1343174400 71 It's cheap, never force closes or anything like that. All you do is turn it on, connect your computer or other device that you want to share files with to same network/wifi, go to the URL it uses, &amp; start dragging files &amp; folders between devices &amp; that's it. everything is done from your Web browser so can be used with any device that is connected to same network. Very convenient.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B007TCMOY2 1 1340409600 79 It seems all if the apps don't work correctly with bad interfaces. Why would any developer want to promote apps that not only they don't work right or don't with at all &amp; are unplayable, have bad interface &amp; no instructions. Where in the world does Amazon come up with these apps? At least when google has had the very few ten cent app sales they were really good apps I wish google would have more deals like that.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00G4NUQYM 2 1393718400 287 First of all I want to say this should be a free download. Nothing about this app has me thinking that it is worth paying any price for it up front. I like the concept but it's an unorganized mess. I think the levels should at least be categorized and it should obviously go from easy to hard but it doesn't at all. Maybe if the letters in the letter bank were in abc order or something like that it would make the game a whole lot less frustrating. Between the complete randomness of the questions and the way a level will start out with a tricky question and then go to completely obvious questions my brain is completely scrambled while I'm trying to sort out the chunks of words that are listed. I've played other games that have the same exact concept with chunks of words that you have put together to make the correct word that goes with the clues and I've never felt this frustrated, especially from the very beginning of the game!It's nice that you can complete the levels in any order you want, and there's no time limit or penalties for wrong guesses, but it needs a lot of work- especially to be considered a good paid game. You can unlock the unlimited clues for $3 and then pay more to unlock more levels, I guess this would be fair if the game was free and was designed a lot better, but this is ridiculous after paying to download it in the state the game is in. Usually I don't complain too much about iap, even if it's a paid app, as long as you feel like you're getting your money's worth.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00820STKI 5 1341014400 29 But after about 5 minutes I decided it was a real cool game. There are a few games where you hit the Sparks &amp; make fireworks. Great time waster
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00CO4KGYA 5 1378080000 160 I had no idea what to expect and after reading the reviews (at the time there were only a few and they were all pretty negative or very negative) so I almost passed up taking advantage of this faotd. The game doesn't look like much but it is fun. I have a handful of little games that I play when I'm bored so it looks like I'll be adding this one to my little collection.The object of the game is to hit as many bad guys as you can using in the least amount of throws  and you get bonus points for hitting the guys in their face. There are objects introduced that you can hit with the ball to help hit more guys and there are objects (glass) that you try to avoid or else the ball will stop if it hits it. The story line in the beginning is kinda funny and I really like the background music.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B007BPYCAG 3 1333324800 67 I like how you can change how fast it changes pages. I guess considering the name of the app all it needs  is the objects it has. It would be nice to be able to add your own objects or something to be able to work with more but there's enough to make stick people fight plus a few extra shapes like circle, square, and reusable triangle.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00BQPEIT2 5 1390003200 116 I always liked the original temple run so when temple run brave came out I bought it right away. Luckily I liked the original temple run so much because I almost didn't get temple run oz because I wasn't crazy about temple run brave. Almost everything about this Disney temple run is so good. The only thing that bothers me about these Disney games is that they're pretty much ads for their movies, I really think they should be free and maybe have the in app purchases but not both. It's really annoying getting popups for this game about buying extra items. Other than that one annoyance I love this game and I loved the movie.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B005ZXWMUS 4 1333929600 68 When it's playing right it's definitely a5 star app but it's out of sync alot and sometimes it starts freezing the phone. I have found after rebooting phone it usually works better. I do have a 'low grade'phone so maybe that has something to do with it. I'm glad it doesn't require using the browser with flash or of be sol so this is great when it works.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00EEDJHXA 4 1387497600 232 This is one of those games that you can waste a lot of time on without realizing it. If you're like me it's not just about flying though the levels just to beat them, you have to get high enough scores so that you can earn 3 stars, so even though I pass a level I find myself having to play the harder levels over and over until I get those dang stars. What is SUPER annoying for me (and actually caused me to dock a star on my rating) is the scoring system. It doesn't show you what time you have to beat to get your stars. It would be so much easier and less annoying if I just knew what time I needed to beat! Also, after a certain point it doesn't seem like the levels go in order from easy to hard, it seems like one level is super hard and the next was much more obvious than the previous level (maybe it's just me??) Other than that it is strangely addicting for such a simple concept and it's really cute. Props to the developer for taking a concept that has been used in many games and making it a little different and cute with the buttons and scissors. I don't know what I'm doing to  do withall of these extra levels if they don't drive me crazy first!
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00BGBOK9O 5 1384041600 209 Even though it seems like a couple pictures might be iffy in a couple of the levels it's still super easy. The best part of this 4pics app is everything is unlocked for 99&cent; so there's no in app purchases, you get as many hints as you want and imo it's easier than other apps like this that I've tried. Many reviewers have been complaining that some of the pictures just made no sense but for the most part they do or else they're easy enough to figure out with the given letters you have to choose from and the amount of blocks and if you still can't figure out you get unlimited hints that will give you the next letter without making you pay for it or share the app with your social networks.I'd definitely recommend this one for 99&cent; and I really can't understand all of the negative reviews but that is usually how it goes with many faotd. I wonder if the people who were complaining haven't tried some of the other 4pics apps because I usually uninstall most of them soon after trying. It really seems like the good ones are very few in between the hundreds of these types of apps to choose from.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B007TBHAOC 5 1382486400 94 This game is pretty fun. It has really nice graphics and isn't too much like a million other games so it's easy to figure out because it is a side scrolling game but it's different enough so it doesn't feel like you're playing the same type of side scrolling game that you come across all the time. It is well made, doesn't lag, and it's a game you can play for a while without finishing after 10 minutes, and it's super cute. It's an entertaining game that I like and the kids like too.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00AECGQF2 5 1383004800 48 There are many hair supplies, colors, cutting tools, and backgrounds to choose from. I like the layout the way you can swipe over to the next sections . I wish there were more people to choose from. It's cool that you can share your creation after you're done.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00AQM8H9I 5 1366934400 119 I think this is a really good basic game that I think could start to get addictive. It's one of those games that are good when you're bored. The games are really quick and best of all you can play with up to four other people (or play against the computer) and you can choose how many opponents you want. It's trickier than it looks but I think after playing more you'll have it down real quick and win every time. I'm not sure if it'd start getting boring pretty fast. The graphics look good, the size of the game isn't too bad 16mb and there was no lagging at all. I think it was a well made game.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B007PTJOV0 5 1335139200 32 It's a fun game, there's a couple things that I'd change to be more like Mario but I'm not complaining. I love how you don't die right away if you have acorns.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B0085YNML2 5 1382486400 73 I think this game is super cute and fun. The little lizard is so cute and the graphics are really good. It is a stable game that never lags and the touch controls are spot on. It starts out really easy but it gets more difficult as you advance to higher levels. It's a game that I like to play to pass time for a few minutes and the kids like it too.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00910Y1OQ 5 1353456000 296 I thought it was going to be yet another jewel Qwest game that I got sick of long before Android devices even came out but I think the name of the title &amp; pictures really caught my eye. Of course as you can see from the pictures it is like the jewel quest games where you switch the 2 objects between their spaces to line up objects but there's something about this game that makes it not so boring. I guess you could say it's jewel quest with hidden objects that you have to find that goes along with the nice story &amp; each world level has it's own story descriptions that are interesting. The graphics are beautiful &amp; I love the background music. The game starts out easy &amp; slowly gets harder at a decent pace that doesn't stay so easy that it's boring nor does it get so hard to fast that makes it frustrating but you may have to try the harder levels more than once &amp; it's a good idea to save your magic charms for the harder levels.  I noticed another game by the same name but it's by a different developer that looks like the same exact thing but don't get fooled, you can tell the developer didn't put as much skill or time into their version of this game, it really looks terrible after playing this one.  One thing that I can say it's that I was surprised the game itself was so big but after seeing hire much detail was put into it I guess I shouldn't be to surprised. Sorry about the long review I just wanted to express how surprised I was at how this game turned out. I how it helps anyone who it's interested.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B005HXUSS4 3 1347753600 25 Or at least I think the controls are off, either way it didn't feel right. Maybe I needed more time to get used to it.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B004XJHBCE 1 1335052800 170 I thought this would be the prefect app and of course the stock browser bookmarks should be more customizable and have folders. I also noticed this app said it's the only one that lets you view your customized bookmarks in their folders directly in the browser whereas other apps like this can only view in a widget on your home screen. after spending some time adding my many bookmarks into folders &amp; making it all prefect I went to the browser to see how it'd look and all of my bookmarks were gone. The folders were there but you couldn't do anything with them &amp; when trying to open the folder it just opened a error generated webpage. Of course I didn't have my bookmarks backed up for some reason I didn't think of backing them up. I would love to have folders and customizable bookmarks in my stock browser like dolphin but I still can't find a solution for what seems to be something that should come that way.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B004R49A4W 5 1335398400 128 I'm not the bird lover in my family but my dad is. I'm always showing him the cool apps and stuff he could do if he had an Android phone or tablet so I can't wait to show him this. I would've never came across an app like this if it weren't a free app of the day. I don't mind supporting great developers so if he likes this app as much as I think he will I'll have no problem supporting green mountain digital by buying this app after the free promotional day is over. I love it when I see high quality really good apps in the faotd section it has really helped me find a few really good apps that I would've never found before.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00BWA8BAS 5 1391472000 160 This is another game that I wouldn't have thought to try if it hadn't been a faotd. The goal is really basic- try to get as far as you can and collect as many points as you can. The further you go will get you more points that you can cash in at the store for stuff that'll help you get further and earn even more points. At first I had thought that it seemed pretty boring but after I started buying things from the store it started getting fun deciding which item will help get further. It gets pretty repetitive but it's addicting too because you end up competing with your high scores and the different items you can buy (from the points you earned) gives it some variety.I recommend this game to anyone who likes to play entertaining basic games that helps pass some time. Even if you don't Adventure Time you will still probably like the game.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B006DU97XC 4 1335916800 59 I love the TV listing grid, all of my channels show up and are correct when I programmed it to my city &amp; cable provider. The main thing it's missing is to be able to add movies to your favorites. It rally needs a septate movie section that's really a turn off &amp; was reason I only gave 4*
A10OEBNZKX48KU B0067R8JNK 5 1374537600 146 when I first opened the game and saw all of the letters sitting there I couldn't imagine how I'd come up with 2,3,4,5,&amp;6 lettered words only using every single letter on the board but after I gave it a try I realized it was a lot easier than I thought. After a couple tries I was hooked. I really like word games but it depends on the game. Word hero is probably my favorite word game that you can play against other people and I think this is my fav single player game. I was glad to see it does not require internet access. There were a few words that I thought maybe should've been counted but only encountered that a couple times. I'd definitely recommend this game. Even my 6 year old &amp; 9 year old boys like helping me choose words when I play.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00634GHJA 3 1375833600 273 This could be a useful app IF it had a better interface &amp; it gave you a personal URL you could share for computers that aren't connected to the same wifi (like for sharing pics with friends.) My main complaint about the interface that really pissed me off was that I didn't realize it only let you choose multiple pictures from within a single folder. If you choose pics from 1 folder &amp; then try to choose pics from a different folder it won't work. Also, I'm not going to complain about only being able to send pics &amp; videos since that's obviously what the app is made for but it would've been nice if the interface was more tailored for video and picture files~ it'd be nice (for ppl who have many folders with pictures all over the place) if it showed thumbnails on the folders instead of just having a bunch of plain blue folders that you have to click through to find pictures. I kind of liked that it puts multiple pictures in a zip file but I want to choose which folder to send it to like you can do with wifi transfer pro or wifi file explorer pro. It does the very minimal of what I expected it to do 2 years ago but it is still the same basic disappointing app after all this time. So many apps have come so far since then, it's sad to see this app is still the same after all this time. Oh we'll, it can still be useful for some people (at a high price for such a basic app)
A10OEBNZKX48KU B0059WTMLW 4 1339200000 247 Thus is just a thought, these bad reviews with really bad ratings show show up more &amp; more especially with Amazons free app of the day apps...Alot of people like open feint and ask for it to be added on apps for some reason, I'm wondering if the ppl who say it's adware or spyware really know what it is? Add far as I know developers use that analytic &quot;spyware&quot; to improve their apps to see what people like by seeing what pages/games we like and visit most, collect scores to see how people are doing &amp; they can tell if it's too hard or too easy &amp; stuff like that. I guess i can under stand feeling used or taken  advantage of or whatever because it's not mentioned in the description &amp; they don't tell you up front what there collecting but most of the time you're not given the option to opt out &amp; unless you have an app scanner that tells you which addons are used you don't even know it's there so by them giving the option to turn the stuff off they're letting you know it's there and giving you the choice to opt out. idk what ppl really think they're stealing from you? To me this is different than when developers use  push ads &amp; add stuff to your desktop with out letting you know, with the analytics data they collect they use it to make their apps better for us
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00CGNYDIE 5 1384473600 192 By the time I finished the first puzzle I felt like I had a good grasp on the puzzles. The best hint I read is to double tap the blocks that only has one color in it so you can see exactly which box goes with it. If it weren't for that I'd have a hard time because sometimes I assume the wrong box is the correct box when there are a couple boxes touching it. I think the difficulty levels are perfectly paced so that you don't get bored or frustrated. You can get hints if you're stuck , I'm not sure if hints are limited or not, and I don't think it makes you start over if you get a bunch of mistakes whichis helpful when you're first trying to figure the game out. This is good for passing time when you're bored and want to relax because it's not frustratingly hard at all. I do like the FlipPix Art apps (by same developer) better and would definitely recommend them to anyone who likes puzzle apps and I would recommend the HexLogic apps to anyone who likes the flippix apps.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B007N9FKCY 4 1355616000 182 The controls are good but you have to get used to how hard and when to click the arrows to get exactly where you want to go which is challenging because the little guy is always jumping and you have to stay out of the way of obstacles. It really is a well put together game, good story, cute graphics, music that goes well with the game that you can turn off.I thought this was going to be another jumping game (which I like) but it's not because you don't tilt the screen &amp; you don't only go up. You're supposed to beat the levels with a certain amount of jumps, get all of the jewels &amp; for the last thing I can't say what it it's because the only tinge I got it was in the first level! I think it's very challenging &amp; can't play for too long without getting annoyed but it is a good game &amp;I think I just need more practice with the controls. I keep wanting to hit a button to shoot the bad guys lol.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B004UT6RE0 4 1335398400 93 The 1st time I ran the app immediately after I installed it from Amazon it said that there's a newer version and when it updated the app it didn't update it from the app store and when I opened the page in the Amazon app store it doesn't have this app as being installed now. It'd be nice to know exactly what I installed like a change log and stuff and why it doesn't show as being installed here on Amazon where I originally got it from. I thought that was very weird.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B006ZAY5GY 5 1391040000 172 It would be better if you could swipe the icon away on the notification bar or if you could change the brightness right from the notification bar. Most new phones comes with a brightness slider on the notification bar but for some reason it was left out on my Sprint LG G2 so this is looks like it'll be a good app for me.The reason it's better than the options we have on our phone and auto brightness settings is because you can choose your settings. It's really cool that you can set a brightness setting for certain times. I think that's a really cool feature that should automatically come on phones.This app might not be for everyone because you might not need these extra settings or you're happy with your auto brightness settings that comes on the phone, but for everyone else this is a great option. IDK why people install apps just because it's a faotd and then give bad ratings because they don't have a need for the app.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B008K8U13K 3 1347926400 108 This really looks like the original sonic (or I should say at least the first few levels) but after playing for a little while I can't get passed too many levels cuz the controls are terrible &amp; lag like crazy. By now there should've been an update to fix this cuz it's really bad &amp; after all of these Android sonic games sega has made they really should have gotten the controls straight b4 releasing any more. If single developers can get controls right without lagging on fast paced games than sega should definitely have no problem doing this. I'd like to know how the other versions play.
A10OEBNZKX48KU B007ZSADMK 2 1350086400 21 It didn't even come on, just a black screen then went to phones home screen. maybe it needs flash player, idk
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00FHEP9XM 5 1395360000 202 I've been using Swype with dragon since it first came out in beta. I have tried so many different keyboards over the years but I still come back to Swype every time. It is the most accurate keyboard ever and it looks really good on phones and tablets. The sync option is perfect so I don't have to manually add words to each dictionary between all of my devices. The options are perfect and it doesn't try to correct a word that I've already corrected after typing a punctuation mark next to it or if I have to go back to the word. Most of the time when I Swipe it can be really sloppy and it still adds the correct word just about every single time. I couldn't expect anything better from a keyboard app.This version has some extra options that makes it so much better than the version that comes pre-installed on different devices. It is so worth the few dollars. For some reason Amazon apps are always a version behind the play store apps, this one included but if you don't already have the app you still don't want to miss out on this one if it's still free!
A10OEBNZKX48KU B004SZ1U66 4 1342310400 544 Me and my kids love playing this game. I have come to realize this is kind of an addicting & really might be worth  $5. Not only do you make the pottery, auction, & fill pottery orders & then use the money you earn to buy supplies but you can share the pictures & submit them online where you can view other peoples pottery & comment & rate it too & you can view everything in your profile. You really have to check out what people have made on their website, I was really surprised about some of the designs & how they were decorated. It took me a little while to get into the groove of how it worked because it took a while to get orders like I saw in the YouTube video & for some reason I either didn't notice the auction button or it just wasn't  but now I got the hang of it & now I know I can take a picture to save it to my sd card so even after an item is sold I can still see a everything I've made even after I sold it.I wasn't sure about even downloading this as a faotd because of all of the negative reviews talking about the being a shady scammer. Idk what all of these bad reviews are about. I don't think you can get reliable reviews for any free app of the day, it's really sad. I've bought a bunch of brushes & paint colors but I used the $I earned from selling & auctioning the pottery I made, I didn't see anything about in app purchases until recently but it is definitely not something you feel like you have to buy in order to do the activities or play the game or whatever you want to call it. It would be nice if you could buy the extra stuff with your play $ but I just pretend like I didn't see the extra items & if I want them that bad I'll pay the extra 99 cents, no big deal, we pay for stuff all the time for stuff we already bought, it reminds me of (on a much smaller level) having to pay for the stupid xbox live membership every year after spending hundreds of dollars on the consol & all of the games but you don't HAVE to buy it. I don't know how many other great faotd  i passed on cuz of all the trolls hating on stuff  obviously don't even know about &I; wonder how many of those people talking about in app purchases & whatever else they were giving negative reviews about were just echoing what others were saying without trying the app in the first place. It's really ridiculous all of the people in the Amazon app store who have no idea what they're talking about & go overboard about permissions they don't fully understand. I'm glad I realized it before missing out on another really good free app of the day, it's not often that we get really good faotd to choose from in the first place.Ok, I'm done, sorry about the ranting, I feel better now! I hope at least the first part of my review helped!
A10OEBNZKX48KU B00G9B1MEM 5 1396051200 167 I had to give 5 stars just for the amount of work that must've went into making the game because it looks great and the sensor controls are perfect.As far as the game goes it's pretty good. You have to guide your ball of clay through the land avoiding certain obstacles and squishing others. If there's &amp;#34;!&amp;#34; on an object then stay away from it. At the beginning of each level it'll give you an objective like rolling over 6 noodles or whatever. You can buy stuff with your clay so if the objective is to get 20 clay noodle worms then you might want to pay to make more clay noodle worm things yy6so more will show up on the level. You'll probably want to save your clay for the higher levels because each different clay guy costs more.Like some people already mentioned, they really need to ad some more info about things like the upgrades and what you want and what you want to avoid.
A10OEW3BWYRWE2 B004SH9JSU 5 1361491200 20 It is a pretty good game and is very realistic. I am just starting. Yeah.Download this game. It is awesome.

A10OEW3BWYRWE2 B0064DBE9I 5 1356998400 124 I was looking for an app for my baby cousin to play so I was looking. and this app she started banging away she loved it and then I found you can make it teach you songs so I put it on Mary Had A Little Lamb and she played it slowly but later on she pretty much got it down and she played really well for someone who is one and I started to play some stuff after she went home and I sounded pretty good I even memorized when the saints and amazing grace would recommend for young children and perhaps preteens who love music and want a fun FREE way to play some simple tunes without all the confusing musical notes

A10OEW3BWYRWE2 B007OXASB2 1 1342051200 85 at first when I saw the cute dog I was gonna buy it but then I saw the reviews and my heart sank deeper and deeper into the pit of my stomach.I could not believe what was on my kindle fire. and when my heart reached the very bottom of my stomach I wrote this tragic,heartbreaking, perfectly composed,breathtaking review on this application that I wanted to install to my device but sadly the reviews made my want come to a cease for all of eternity
A10OEW3BWYRWE2 B004DPCSKI 1 1357171200 113 if u r a scaredy cat and cant handle scary stuff don't get it.it is that simple I seriously don't get why people think its fun to be scared I mean like you are worried what's going happen just live your life with a clean diaper Ps I think all you horror movie makers are sick and twisted my friend at school said when she was five she saw  a little&quot;ghost&quot;girl with a jump rope please give me a break people should have better things to do than sit their with a poopy diaper cause you are so scared and you are just sitting there in fear that a &quot;ghost&quot;will be in there
A10OEW3BWYRWE2 B00AREIAI8 5 1359072000 29 NICE APP AND BY THE WAY ASK YOUR CAT IF HE WANTS TO COME OVER FOR TACOS TOMORROW NIGHT BUT IF HE DOESN'T THEN SHUN HIM FROM YOUR FAMILY
A10OEW3BWYRWE2 B004VGH93A 5 1364774400 72 Personally I adore the app.I cannot stop laughing. But some people may be offended by this app.So maybe look a little deeper into who you tell these jokes to or you may hurt feelings or worse case scenario lose a close friend.btw I love Harry Potter Justin Bieber is a poopy poopy poopie hole I never liked him my bff typed it in when I wasn't looking she is a jerkasaurasrex sometimes.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00BXL45G0 5 1366675200 29 Love this app. Play all the time. Recommend to anyone who likes to play fast pace game. Win as many bingos as much as u can in 60 seconds
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00B2TET3C 5 1365724800 34 Love this game. The best one I played so far. Others I have 2 Waite until the next day. But this 1 is a whole lot better and more fun. It's great pass time.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00AMEFZ72 5 1375315200 20 Love this game. Great app, would recommend to anyone who likes to play bingo. My son loves to play also.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00CW6DAKC 4 1389484800 29 Gave 4 stars, cause keeps telling me network error. But love this game, recommend for all ages. But none of my Facebook friends won't play. But login it anyway.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00BHHIWQO 5 1389484800 20 Love this game. Very addicting. Would recommend for everyone, and every age. Gave 5 stars. Keep up the good work.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00DRPVE3M 4 1375747200 22 Love this game. Just wish u didn't have to pay to play more. Love playing with my friends and family. Thank u
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B008Y7SMQU 1 1366070400 25 Love this app. Me and my son are having fun. Very challenging. Some difficulty, but very challenging. Would recommend to anyone that likes a challenge.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B00BMH4GQE 5 1366070400 30 Great app. My boyfriend and I have a great pass time with this game. Good for family and friends. I recommend it to anyone who loves to play word games.
A10OI22Q2KF4QA B008JJS6D2 5 1363651200 20 Love this game. I would recommend to my friends and family and neighbors.I finally can download this game FOR free
A10OJALKBIN3Z9 B008JJS6D2 4 1363046400 48 I like this game a lot. I thought it was a little weird at first because you're not playing against other people but now I play all the time. My one complaint is that you aren't awarded enough credits to play as often as I would like to.
A10OJALKBIN3Z9 B00881VLCE 5 1362873600 54 I really like this app and use it a lot before I go to bed. You can pick many different difficulties for each puzzle and there are many free extra puzzles to download if you want to switch it up. I didn't think I'd really use this app but I do all the time.
A10OJALKBIN3Z9 B008JK6W5K 2 1357344000 41 Ok but not enough variety in the types of accepted answers. Some don't accept an answer unless it's the abbreviation. Others only accept the abbreviation. Really they should all accept both. It's a little frustrating but fun for a free app.
A10OS468BWBFZG B00DDN6PB4 4 1379721600 99 It's a interpretation of a board game first off. So this won't be a fast paced shooter. Graphics are very nice. Ship designs are cool to look at as well. Wish music had more variety. But you can't expect too much for a .99 app. A zoom function would be nice so phone players could aim shots better. I played one game and won, so haven't come across the bug others are referring to. I think I'll enjoy this one. Would have paid full price. 4 stars, hopefully zoom and an assortment of music tracks are added in update.
A10OS468BWBFZG B007BFSYMS 5 1359244800 29 Very good app, 20 or so sounds, sound good even with phone speaker, easy to use. I got thhis as faotd, but would have paid full price for it.
A10OV5A7AJIK9I B0064X7B4A 5 1368230400 30 Love that I can play with random people.  You have to wait for them to take their turn but sometimes they have to wait on you. Overall I love playing
A10OV5A7AJIK9I B00AZZGOWI 5 1361836800 32 Love this game.  Perfect  Building game  would recommend  this game to others that enjoy building games.  I like that you have to keep up on the trash,  keep the cavemen from fighting.
A10OV5A7AJIK9I B00AIQP9DE 3 1357516800 22 Game had a story to it. Felt that there could have been more to it. Game seemed to end way too soon.
A10OXYB2DAW9UC B0063IH60K 3 1325635200 57 I thought the graphics were a bit limited, as were the options. I have another free solitaire app where the graphics look better, and it has a very large number of games available.I can see where Iphone users would like this,  but honestly it is a bit limited and cheesy looking for an Android app.Samsung Exhibit 4G.
A10OXYB2DAW9UC B005ZXWMUS 5 1325635200 59 Must say I love this app! I am disabled, and have kids. When they have taken over the TV or I simply cannot stand even sitting, I can still access Netflix on my phone and watch a movie, TV, or documentary. None of the menu issues mentioned for other platforms on my phone.Works very nicely on Samsung Exhibit 4G!
A10OXYB2DAW9UC B005SJTLUS 1 1322524800 67 My specialty is net security (MSIA).  I try not to get too paranoid about permissions,  but the ability to tske thumbnail pics of other apps running on my phone is a big red flag! This needs explanation, especially for a game.I will not download any game that breaches my privacy and security so badly?  There should be no need for this except maybe for a development application.
A10OXYB2DAW9UC B004YL6RUI 2 1316908800 66 I have a Samsung Exhibit 4G, and I run Go Launcher. Was having bad memory issues today. Found that for some reason random apps were starting up in the background. Facebook, video player, Slacker etc. etc. I would kill them just to have them restart or have 2 others open. Facebook especially kept restarting.Found out it was THIS app behind it all! Very suspicious behavior. AVOID!
A10P1BUFGUG12O B008M721MS 1 1402531200 27 Every time I send a message it says pending, and takes up to an hour to go through. Unbelievable. It's annoying when you wanna talk to friends
A10P1BUFGUG12O B00594XOZU 4 1396915200 51 This social app is just my favorite app yet. There are some frequent crashes and you haft to restart it but other wise I love it. And also sometimes when you send a message you haft to restart the app for the message to go through (no it's not the internet)
A10P1BUFGUG12O B00AXKPWSM 1 1402617600 38 You can't even view your pictures you take. Or view the edited pictures you take too. Wow what a waste space. Thing is if you want to delete the photos you Hart to delete the whole album... Yea
A10P1BUFGUG12O B00KI5Q8X0 1 1401667200 48 Wow. I do recall sending an email to add this game. I bet myself alone didn't  change that or maybe amazon was already gonna  do it. But in the all episodes the color on characters disappears. Please fix. I mean rarely do they comeback and it's very limited
A10P1BUFGUG12O B00HF19RVK 3 1393804800 50 Yes this game is super fun but if you plan on buying the next episodes don't the purchase will go through but with no return product  maybe it was just with or maybe not but I tried and did not get the second episode and yet it still took money
A10P5GCN6BFUGJ B00DUZKE4O 4 1385856000 26 Really a fun and addicting game. I leave that you can choose animated or regular movies. I will continue to have in my &quot;on call&quot; games.
A10P5GCN6BFUGJ B00EBQRSTK 4 1378252800 23 Lots of fun. Would like payoff to be larger per correct answer. Really addicting! Some are very, very Tricky. Keeps me coming back.
A10P5GCN6BFUGJ B00E5GJ7QS 4 1377561600 20 Fast speed. Affordable. Keeps me playing. Would like to see the levels open sooner. Will continue to play and enjoy.
A10P5GCN6BFUGJ B00FPH8L40 4 1384646400 32 Fun game, but can be tough to move on to the next level.  There are hints available through coins but that can get spendy, you can purchase more coins with real money.
A10P5HOD06UXY5 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1368057600 27 Great game. Made you really think. Try not to use the hints or you will finish the game a lot faster. Can't wait for the 2nd one.
A10P5HOD06UXY5 B006RM6JCI 4 1381449600 22 This game is fun to play and easy to understand. The tutorial is very helpful for those who may find it difficult.
A10P5HOD06UXY5 B008L29K6E 4 1382054400 28 This game and the other games in their series and fun to play. You are able to exercise your brain and still have a good time doing it.
A10P5N8F7MQCAF B006D1ONE4 5 1329955200 20 addictive and fun and a great logic challenge.  It is a nice way to relax after a mentally stressful day.
A10P5N8F7MQCAF B00ANT8OF6 5 1378166400 24 My young daughter loves the game and is learning to recognize numbers and add much more quickly.  Of course she loves the show too.
A10P5N8F7MQCAF B00EDF43MY 3 1378166400 31 Great images.  Cute idea but my daughter who doesn't usually have trouble walking through a new game seems unsure of what to do next...and yes we've been to a few airports.
A10P7TZXBSQAIE B00ERXVOII 5 1380758400 27 It's a pretty good game to have if you in to ninjas and stuff I'm So good at this game and I recommended it to you guys
A10P7YVZ3BSN2K B0069F2RCE 2 1360368000 28 I was disappointed with this game.  I love scramble with friends and words with friends, but this game is too slow and should have optional number of opponents.
A10P7YVZ3BSN2K B0064X7B4A 4 1367971200 26 Great game for Scrabble lovers.  No board to set up and you can play with friends or relatives that don't live nearby.  Love the shuffle option.
A10P848TZB5T60 B00CZDSK7K 4 1395187200 69 There is always something to do and things going on. I wish the generations could advance quicker .The only thing I would for warn about - this game reset on me after I had made in so purchased and three  generations are gone, has to start from scratch AGAIN! I was pissed for a minute, but the game is fun- so I got over it I guess : )
A10PCJKRBFG8GX B00CZDSK7K 3 1378684800 20 I HATE this app!!!  Its stupid! IT ISNT VERY FUN TO PLAY AND IT GETS ON MY NERVES.!!! DONT DOWNLOAD.IT!!!

A10PEM4CWPF1VN B00HKF00UI 5 1391558400 24 Lots of bonus rounds and real play action. A good game you don't want to miss out on.  Good graphics and great slot action.
A10PEM4CWPF1VN B00H343YNQ 4 1396569600 21 Good choice of slots, many different games to choose from. Lags a little. Would give more stars if it didn't lag.
A10PEM4CWPF1VN B00AF09O2A 5 1370304000 24 This game is straight forward and easy to play. The bonuses add to the fun. If you like keno you will love this version.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B005QT1KU4 2 1343174400 106 The graphics on this game are pretty good and display fine on my Kindle Fire, but the game does play fairly slow.  Combined with the lack of instructions on how to fly the helicopter as well as the lack of instructions on how to land, fight, or the objective once the game starts was fairly frustrating: after about ten minutes of frustration and boredom, I deleted it off of my Fire.With the effort that was obviously put into developing the nice graphics, you would think a developer would spend some time writing instructions on how to play the game - especially since it retails for $2.99!
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B004HE5TAG 3 1384992000 62 This is a pretty good version of blackjack and can keep you entertained for a while.  However, it is annoying to have continual pop-ups asking you to pay for more chips, etc. to unlock &#8220;more&#8221; fun.  However, the app was free so you get what you pay for &#8211; I ended up deleting this from my Fire because of the constant pop-ups.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B009KEN87O 4 1366934400 136 Overall, this is an interesting little game that can fill up the 5-10 minute breaks you have here and there in your life that is a mix of the classic arcade games Space Invaders and Galaga.  The graphics are fairly low tech, but that's ok as this game is not one of those you will be spending a tremendous amount of time on where every detail has to be perfect.  This is a fairly easy game to play.I picked this up for free during a free app of the day promotion and, as I type this review it has reverted to $1.28 in the Amazon App store.  If you're looking for something besides Angry Birds to work in a pinch, and enjoyed classic arcade games such as Space Invaders or Galaga, I would recommend this one.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B004LZF2LW 4 1393027200 214 This little clock app would be great if you are traveling internationally - I like the neat graphic that shows the world with the different time zones and where the sun is shining and where it is dark, etc. and the graphics are really sharp and crisp.  You can also setup alarms for those different time zones.  This would have been really handy for knowing what time it was in various time zones around the world when I was traveling internationally a lot and wanted to be sure I wasn't calling when someone was probably asleep.Programming the alarm, adjusting the time, etc. is pretty easy - although the app does sync with via your router to figure out the time at your specific location.  This will be great for using while I travel.I picked this up for free as part of the app of the day vs. its normal price of $2.99; if you travel internationally, or are contacting people all over the globe and want to quickly find the local time before you disturb them, I would recommend this one.  However, if you are a USA / domestic traveler and are just looking for an alarm clock app, I'd pick up one of the many free ones here in the Amazon App Store.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00EOGZ42U 4 1395360000 227 This game started off as difficult to play as the instructions leave a lot to be desired &#8211; I came really close to deleting it out of frustration, but then a lightbulb went off for me with what I think the developers would have put in an instruction manual: from there it has been fun to play.  I&#8217;ve found I have spent several hours playing this &#8211; an hour at a time &#8211; as you move from one level to another.  The concept is pretty basic &#8211; grow your own aliens in space on a planet / asteroid and then try to take over another populated planet.If you turn the full graphics package on (you can adjust it), the graphics are pretty detailed; I leave it on as minimal as possible as this game is a huge drain on your Kindle Fire battery: after about an hour and a half of play (I know, it sounds like I have a problem), starting with a full battery with the 8.9&#8221; HDX you will be down to about 10% power.I originally picked this up for free as a free app of the day vs. its normal price of $4.99; despite my discussion of the instructions in the first paragraph, I will say I&#8217;ve received a heck of a lot more entertainment value out of this and would recommend it.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B008245WE0 3 1344643200 278 I purchased this app at the end of June while I was traveling, as I was having a heck of a time going to sleep in a random hotel room.  It installed easily on my Motorola RAZR phone and I had it up and running in no time and was able to quickly fall to sleep.  I kept the phone hooked up to the charger as I didn't want the app to drain the battery and leave me stranded after I woke up the next morning.I liked it so much I installed it to my Kindle Fire, also.This app, while having a few bells and whistles, has the basic tasks down - a soothing rain noise (not a thunderstorm) that I can speed up or slow down to make the storm effects different, easy volume control, and you can either let the rain run a set period of time or in a continuous loop.You can see the raindrops dropping on your screen and you can speed up or slow down that effect, also, but I didn't really see the point as I'm certainly not looking at the screen when I am trying to sleep.You do get a lot of requests to review the app when you turn it on, which is quite annoying.  I guess it worked in my case and due to the annoyance factor I'm taking away a star - it becomes tiresome to continually end the popup each and every time you turn on or activate the app!Overall, if you're looking for a good rain background noise app and can live with the annoying popups when you turn the app on, I recommend this one.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B0064X7B4A 2 1361923200 205 Hello.  My name is Michael, and I am a Words with Friends addict.While I am a WWF addict, this free version I use to play on my Kindle Fire is really pretty bad - slow, unresponsive, and it crashes all of the time.  Not just on one Kindle Fire, but all four versions of the Fire I own (original, 2nd generation, 7" HD version and the 8.9" version).  While it is free, and I understand the need for ads to support the free version, you would think Zynga's crash reporting system would tell them it crashes nearly every other time an ad is shown.I just upgraded to version 5.8.1 this morning, and it gets worse: you are forced to use only landscape mode which squeezes all of the letters smaller (prior versions you could do either portrait or landscape), and after playing one round the app is dead in the water and will not reload.  Yes, I have rebooted, you name it.This is a shame with this free version, as I have the paid-for WWF app on my iPad2.  No ads, fast, responsive - it's great.  When can we expect the same for Android?  I'd willingly pay the same $1.99 for a version that worked!
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B008BJQCCM 2 1392854400 96 At the end of the day, this is a poor man&#8217;s version of Bejweled blitz with some nostalgia thrown in with pictures of the actors in the early 80&#8217;s movie War Games.  It&#8217;s a little slow and clunky, and after playing it for about ten minutes I was pretty bored and deleted off of my Kindel Fire.I originally picked this up as one of the free app of the day offerings vs. its normal price of 99 cents.  If you&#8217;re looking to play Bejeweled Blitz I&#8217;d recommend you grab it and give this one a pass.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00GNIJAEA 1 1392163200 73 This could be the best app ever, but I had to delete it off of my Kindle Fire as it won't let you use it until you log into Facebook and share all of your personal information - including your friend's names and email addresses - with the app developer.  That's pretty much a non-starter, as the last thing I need is more spam nor will I share the pain with my friends.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00G4NUQYM 1 1393718400 144 I picked this up for free as a Free App of the Day offering vs. its normal 99 cent price &#8211; despite being free, I would avoid this one at all costs unless you really enjoy paying 99 cents (or more) for each hint, new level, etc.I enjoy word puzzle-type games, but I find it extremely annoying to have a game that is hard to begin with and limited instructions and being forced to pay extra for a &#8220;hint&#8221; that should have been part of the original programming.  Luring people in to this game as a freebie is really misleading, and a pure money grab on the part of Amazon, as people will naturally want to see what is behind the next screen or even how to play.  I&#8217;ve deleted this one off of my Fire and I would recommend people avoid this game.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B008I43DYU 4 1400025600 225 This is a basic calculator with the usual add, subtract, multiply, and divide; it also has a memory button where you can add or subtract a number stored in memory. If you hold your Kindle Fire in a standard (for me) portrait mode you have the basic calculator functions; if you change the orientation to landscape / sideways mode, you will be able to use approximately 20 different scientific calculations such as sine, cosine, etc.While there are lots of other calculator apps that have the same functionality, what sets this one apart from others I have tried is the number / function icons are HUGE and really help out with avoiding some of the touch-type mistakes I always seem to make on a keyboard.About the only negative I can think of is the app permissions want to have access to the network and gather information about your Wi-Fi network &#8211; that doesn&#8217;t make sense as you don&#8217;t need a network to do basic math. Interestingly, the app ran fine with all of my network settings turned off on my 8.9&#8221; Fire.I picked this up for free as a free app of the day vs. its normal price of 99 cents. If you&#8217;re looking for a basic calculator for your Fire (or other device) that has large number / function icons, I would recommend this one.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00AW3P7Y4 3 1392163200 135 This app reminds me a little of a combination of Words with Friends, Scrabble, and a traditional crossword puzzle.  Once you figure out how to play it can be fun: it is a bit of a pain in the neck at the start because the instructions are fairly nonexistent &#8211; I learned how to play via trial and error &#8211; and if you want some help with it lo and behold a popup appears asking you to purchase something that will help you / explain how the game works.  As the free app of the day, I&#8217;d say go ahead and give it a try; once it reverts back to paid status I&#8217;d avoid it because of the lack of instructions unless you want to shell out more cash for the rules of the game.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B005YFNC92 5 1328313600 166 Previous versions of this app were bad - the new version updated at the end of January and had significant improvements.If you are a subscriber to the online edition of the Wall Street Journal, you should get this app for your Kindle Fire - logging in is a snap, and you can read the paper with ease.  Navigation to the variou ssections is easy, and what I really like is the app keeps one week's worth of newspapers available for you to read in case you mised a day's paper.An additional feature I am enjoying is the "Saved Articles" feature, where I can quickly peruse the headline and a few lines of the article and save it and read it later when I get home.  I could spend several hours reading the WSJ cover to cover, and this little feature saves me a heck of a lot of time.The app is free, which is even better - donwload it now, what do you have to lose?
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00BJ7HA92 4 1392854400 148 This is a fun little twist on the classic Majong game, and what I really like best is the varying levels of difficulty you can have with a different number of tiles.  If you are used to playing &#8220;regular&#8221; Majong, however, please note it can be frustrating at first because you can only remove like tiles that are in a straight line to each other.  One word of caution: after starting to play, I looked up and realized twenty minutes had passed and it is starting to get addictive here on my first day of play.I picked this up for free as part of the app of the day deal here on Amazon vs. its normal price of $1.30; even at $1.30 vs. free, if you like Majong I&#8217;m fairly certain you will get a heck of a lot more entertainment value than $1.30 out of the game.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B0094BB4TW 2 1354924800 87 This app does a limited job of showing you what's going on with your FB friends and family - compared to the Apple FB app on an iPad2 side-by-side, this version has a long way to go and is really in a pre-development phase.  There are quite a few ads in between every second or third of your friend's status updates that are highly annoying: does anyone really click on these?  I would recommend using this version of the app in a pinch, but that's about it.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B008K6HN8I 5 1351900800 110 If you are familiar with Windows Explorer or the My Documents / My Computer features of Windows, you will feel right at home with this app.  It is easy to quickly maneuver around on the file structure of your Kindle Fire and you can copy, paste, delete, etc. to your heart's content.I picked this up for free in the Amazon App store about a year ago, and as I type this review the app is still free - if you have been looking for a good Explorer or file management app for your Kindle Fire, there is no need to look further as you should grab this one right away!
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B006RIQIFK 4 1353715200 212 This is a fun game, similar to Majong, but is a heck of a lot easier and you will be able to master it in about three games.  If there were instructions on how to play, I couldn't find them, but it is different than Majong this way: rather than linking similar tiles that are exposed on the outside or on different levels, the tiles must be linked by a straight line at right angles.  If that sounds confusing, I agree but it took me a few times into my first game to figure it out.  Every tile is on the same level and not stacked, so for a traditional Majong player like me it takes a little getting used to.  You will get sucked into the game and have a lot of fun.If you get stuck, you can mixup the tiles and have them be rearranged with a loss of ten points to your time.  You can also rotate the tiles at different views (up, sideways, etc.) to give you a new perspective.Overall, this is a fun and challenging game.  I picked it up for free during the App of the Day promotion vs. its normal $1.99 price.  Even at $1.99, you're going to gave a lot of fun with it.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B007Q3GY1S 2 1336435200 175 As someone who grew up on the original version and spent numerous hours playing this - and waited desperately for Christmas so you could get the deluxe version - I was excited to see this one available in the app store to play on my Kindle Fire.  However, while the graphics are pretty much true to the way I remember this reproduction of the game is very disappointing.The game will hardly ever let you go more than two spaces forward before the computer tackles you on the Easy mode of the game: the defenders rarely, if ever, move out of the way and are a consistent wall you cannot break through.  Why can't you go backwards like you could with the original?  After about 10-15 minutes of frustration, I deleted the game from my Fire.I picked this one up for free as the app of the day and, as I type this review, now the price is $1.99.  Save your money - even if it became free again I would not recommend it to anyone.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00FAPF5U0 5 1384992000 97 I resisted as long as I could despite the peer pressure, but I will have to say this is one of the most addictive games I have played in a long time &#8211; think of Bejeweled Blitz on steroids.  Seeing how your doing vs. your friends&#8217; progress is very engaging. If you like puzzle-type games, I&#8217;d recommend this one but watch out &#8211; while this game is free to download and initially play, you will be sorely tempted to purchase extra moves, hammers, lives, etc. and the 99 cents to $1.99 each will start to add up!
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B0064X7FVE 2 1353715200 145 I've used this app on my Kindle Fire and my Android enabled smartphone for a little over a year.  For the first six months, it did great and would always update and give me an accurate forecast and let me know what was going on; over the last several months, the app has a hard time connecting or gives me a message the weather service / forecast is not available for my area and to try again; it does, however, work when I travel around the USA from big cities to areas out in the country.Seeing as how I live in Houston, I find that rather hard to believe the Weather Channel doesn't have a forecast for me.  If this happened intermittently, I would be a little more patient.  A better bet has been theAccuWeather for Androidapp, which has now replaced the Weather Channel App.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B006IY163C 1 1328313600 103 I have the Pro version, and let me point out there are not 9 games as advertised.  For example, if you want to play Tempest or Asteroids (including the Asteroids Deluxe), you have to make additional purchases.  What a ripoff.Missile Command, for example, is included but is unwieldy to play on my Kindle Fire - you have a manual trackball you are supposed to tap teh screen with, then somehow simultaneously with your other hand fire the left, middle, and right fire bases.  Almost impossible to do.Needless to say, I've wasted $1.99 and have deleted this app from my Fire.  Save Your Money!
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B00DDZM0GQ 4 1377820800 132 If you like Tetris, or played Tetris 20 or so years ago, I imagine you will like this derivative of the classic game - especially the "survival" mode which has timed levels and is very fast-paced.  There's not much on the instruction level, but you should be able to figure it out fairly quickly, and this can become a very addictive game.About the only drawback I have is it is a battery hog and will drain the battery on your Kindle Fire pretty quick.I originally picked this up for free during the Free App of the Day promotion and, as I type this review, I see the pricing has reverted back to $1.99: if you liked Tetris, or are looking for an addictive game, I think it will be $1.99 well spent.
A10PEXB6XAQ5XF B007ZGO7EM 5 1392163200 138 This is a good, and free, easy-to-use calculator that will do the basic math applications of add, subtract, multiple, and divide.  It also has a basic memory function for storing whatever number you may come up with in a calculation.  There are two things I particularly like about this calculator - the larger icons for the input keys, and you see the math equation you just typed in (i.e., 198 + 36) just underneath your answer.There is a small banner ad taking up the top 5% of the screen that you can eliminate if you purchase the ad-free version.  The ad doesn't bother me - heck, I don't even notice it - and the ad-sponsored version is fine.  If you are looking for a good, basic calculator to use on your Kindle Fire, I would recommend this one.
A10PF1LJOKLAPW B009UWL580 4 1361145600 48 This game is like the one at carnivals!  The difference is you can upgrade your claws and machine; and you can increase the strength of your claw for those hard to lift items.  It is an enjoyable game and is relaxing at the end of a stressful day.
A10PF1LJOKLAPW B008NCUFYS 5 1361145600 27 This game is so fun!  It is &#34;brainless&#34; and relaxing.  I play this after a stressful day to relax before bedtime or anytime to free my mind.
A10PJBV4GHQ7BP B00ANUMR1W 5 1401148800 25 It&acute;s kinda random that your killing dragons with enchanted gauntlets that can have the power to make a green kill-ray but the games REALY FUN.
A10PJBV4GHQ7BP B00AB7HESI 5 1393372800 28 The game is awsome but it needs stuff like star wars characters and halo guys and specific guns like a 45 colt or desert eagle or a pp-s-h
A10PJBV4GHQ7BP B00992CF6W 5 1370217600 23 I LOVE the idea of the nether but I can't get there the creepers are EPIC andI think people should make it revolutionary!!!
A10PJBV4GHQ7BP B00AESN8XY 5 1371427200 47 It's a great app if you want a strategy game, an entertaining game, or if you just want tokill everybody on earth! the reason I got it is because it looked like a cheap little app but I didn't know how AWESOME it was! I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
A10PKM0SLGXWVT B00AMEYWYE 3 1369180800 28 My Grandaughter downloaded this game.  She plays it occasionally.  I am annoided when icon is on other games and when you accidentally tap it the advertisement comes up.
A10PKM0SLGXWVT B00BWBHIUG 3 1375315200 24 Game moves too slowly for older children, geared toward younger children and can be pricy if you use pearls to buy items.  Very colorful.
A10PKM0SLGXWVT B0066T0BTO 5 1369180800 24 My husband loves it.  He plays it a lot.  He likes this version of Bejeweled the best.  I'm sure he will purchase other games
A10PKM0SLGXWVT B00AJ1EWRM 4 1387411200 40 Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old niece.  She loved it, it was easy to navigate and she must have decorated that tree 20 times before she put down the Kindle.  Had to show me her creation every time!
A10PKM0SLGXWVT B0063GORYU 1 1371772800 20 It took 2 days to download this game and now I can't get it to work.  It won't delete either.
A10PMGNK4FEXXI B00ERXVOII 3 1380931200 23 This game it's fun to play but hard to maneuver the little minaj. It's good kind of glitchy needs work but good game.
A10PMGNK4FEXXI B00846GMHW 5 1340409600 27 Its a really fun game...I recommend it. I have fun just wasting time...not much thinking yet still creatively made. I find it fun in so many ways
A10PMGNK4FEXXI B00AE9UYJ4 4 1383177600 85 This game is so scary, I love it. At first I thought it ain't that scary then I played it and wow I was scared crazy... it made me jump the second time I played. I only rated it four stars only because the first time I played I ended up falling through the ground and floating in the air. I believe it's a glitch, but it's not that big a deal. To escape that situation I just hit my home button and started over.
A10PMGNK4FEXXI B00AESN8XY 5 1388361600 28 THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD IF NOT THE BEST. I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE UPDATES. I RECOMMEND THIS APP FOR ANYONE.
A10PMGNK4FEXXI B00B2V66VS 4 1384646400 26 I gave it for stars only because it's a little glitches when I'm playing  built its a good game either way I recommend it big time.
A10PMGNK4FEXXI B008XG1X18 5 1350086400 21 This App is beautifully done, I adore this app. Way better than other apps out there. I recommend this for everyone.

A10PTYA24QOBS7 B004ZFK600 1 1359072000 20 Not free.  Must pay fee to use texting. Sending it back.  No way to get my money back?  Probably not.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00CBJRTPC 5 1370563200 21 Like this little game!!  Pretty challenging and fun.  I like the little story line.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00ENTEP32 5 1381795200 25 Loved the game.  My grandkids loved playing it with me.  It needed to be much longer, though.  We would have loved to have more play.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00E8KLWB4 4 1400371200 29 I like playing the game.  Sometimes there is so many new things to remember that it is hard to remember.  I'm sure the younger generation will have no problem.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00DJFIMW6 5 1374105600 21 Love this cute and exciting game.  Fast, and exciting little game.  It changes with every try!!  Cute and exciting!!  Love it!
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00CWY76CC 5 1374710400 20 Love this game even though it is exasperating at times.  I love a challenge and this game fills the bill!
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B0061S5NNO 5 1356652800 24 I love using this app.  Helps me keep track and has so many foods and updates them regularly.  Easy to add my own foods.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00AJ1S1CY 4 1356652800 20 Pretty fun for the grandkids.  Very cute and good for the holiday season.  The grandkids were familiar with the elf.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B009ZHQLHA 4 1363219200 43 I am enjoying the game.  Was a little slow loading but worth it.  I have purchased  enough of these games to know they are not free.  But I do appreciate that I get a chance to try out the game before purchasing it.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B009MCRHH6 5 1356652800 20 What an awesome and fun game.  I love this game and it is so interesting to play.Cute graphics and sounds.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B007SYWFRM 4 1372982400 36 This is a very fun game.  I love the stuff and the new dino world.  I did have more recent problems and could not get in the in app store.  I hope they fix it soon.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00HCMG6LG 4 1399680000 26 I love playing this game and find it very challenging and great for the brain.  I would recommend this game to anyone who loves a challenge.
A10PTYA24QOBS7 B00AKL1XPU 2 1356652800 21 I don't know why but I cannot remove this game from my Kindle.  I don't like having it on there permanently.
A10PZB2URSY11P B005V1N71W 5 1371168000 32 Pandora Media is the greated; I love it, you can listen to all the oldies when you playing your games. I suggest that if you have a Kindle Fire to download Pandora.
A10PZB2URSY11P B00IU61TPQ 5 1402358400 43 I get so much enjoyment out of the Slots fairtale game! the graphics are awesome and I wish I had discover sooner. Infact I wake up and play; it gets my day started before I go to work. Well done Slots Fairytale designer.

A10Q0CPI6NA0C6 B00AKFBURC 5 1358899200 31 on my kindle fire I was playing it and when I turned it off I tried to turn it back on and It took 2 days for it to cut on
A10Q0CPI6NA0C6 B0087TUZII 1 1348531200 32 all this game does is spends your hard earned money so you can get to another part to spend more of your money. anyone who doesn't believe me check this game out.

A10Q4YHH7BF16 B00ANH526W 4 1358812800 30 I like this game. I like that there is so many different tasks to complete.  it keeps you busy.  also having to keep earning money for each girl is fun.
A10Q4YHH7BF16 B009PSV1HE 5 1351987200 26 It is very addicting game.  You could lose yourself in it for hours.  My kids also enjoy it. We fight over who gets to play it.

A10QDPRMHZXLR3 B007PTJOV0 5 1342310400 15 its really fun I receomend it to all people of all the Mario fans lololloll&agrave;aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
A10QE4PTXO9H0J B00CUWWLWG 4 1383004800 28 Not only is it addicting, it is fun. The pace is just the right speed. The graphics are good. The story line is entertaining and battles are challenging.
A10QE4PTXO9H0J B00FAX6XQC 5 1401580800 21 Entertaining even for a non hunter. The graphics are great the challenge is just right. And difficulty is what you choose.
A10QKBT0TB4Z0Z B005ZXWMUS 5 1399593600 23 Gr8! but they just emailed me to inform me that as a new member my monthly just went up from 7.99 to 8.99.
A10QKBT0TB4Z0Z B00H59CTW6 3 1399593600 21 Defiantly not what I was looking for... Oh! it's a game, the graphics are good and you have to buy things.
A10QKOU1U5Q887 B00A757EFW 5 1360454400 21 My granchildren loaded this game on. It is one of teir favoites, so grandma, is going to give it a try.
A10QKOU1U5Q887 B004SJ3BCI 5 1360454400 24 I chose my rating, for this is a favorite of my grandchildren. I believe they want grandma to try it out, so I Will.
A10QKOU1U5Q887 B0086700CM 5 1360454400 23 This game, is another favoite, of my grands. It's time Mimi, tried it out. Thankyou!  They, rated it high, so I did, also.
A10QLE64LEZYQ B00BS3UFCQ 5 1371340800 20 this is a very great game...I love to play this when I'm bored at home. I really love it alot
A10QLE64LEZYQ B0054JZC6E 5 1327190400 24 this is a great app for wasting time. I really like playing when I'm at home just doing nothing or just passing the time
A10QLE64LEZYQ B00G5LQ5MU 4 1384300800 20 I really like this game but it is saying that I cant go further without paying for hints or answers.
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B00FAPF5U0 4 1382054400 41 I'm so glad this game is finally available on the Kindle Fire! Ive had it on my phone for a while and I'm addicted as much as everyone else. Now if only I can get it to download on my KF...
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B0064X7B4A 5 1372550400 23 this game is a lot like scrabble. I play it on a kindle fire. great game to pass time and keep vocabulary sharp.
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B009WYCDZU 1 1357862400 43 While I understand that ads help &quot;pay for&quot; free games, it annoys the crap outta me when the ads completely prevent game play.  Take the big ad for this game out of the Sims game!!! (Maybe EA will get more relevant reviews then!)
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B0088QDDDY 5 1348617600 49 a lot of the other reviews complain about the basic graphics but I LOVE the graphics! very reminiscent of the games I played as a kid. and I like having to think while playing... how to distract mom, how to get upstairs, etc... please make more games like this!!!
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B008N8IV2U 5 1346803200 116 this game is definitely a challenge! I even had a hard time on some of the levels after looking at the guide! I'm not giving the game 5 stars because it only goes up to level 90 as of Sept 5th, 2012. don't call it 100 floors if there aren't 100 levels. otherwise, I love the game!UPDATE: As of Sept 21st (or so) there are OVER 100 levels!  Im kinda bummed that I uninstalled the game... now I have to go through the first 90 again, but its that much more fun now!  Im excited to play the next 15 levels!!!  (ps, this game now has 5 stars from me because there really are 100 floors)
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B005ET78TS 4 1360195200 73 I personally never fly, so this app is of no real direct use to me.  I do, however, have a few frequent flyers in the family.  I downloaded this app for that reason.  Only glanced at it so far, but loved what I saw!Its nice to see a wider variety of FAOTD's lately too.  Utilities like this one and the organizer a few days ago are an excellent &quot;filler&quot; between all the games!
A10QM1Y3N2ND5K B008JHQXK2 4 1350259200 49 my 2 year old loves this puzzle game! its her favorite game I downloaded for her. I only gave it 4 stars because I cant figure out how to get the rest of the puzzles. id gladly pay for them if there was an obvious way to do so!
A10QQ9DRBG32S3 B00BGBZGEW 4 1368144000 25 I'm enjoying the Pro Word game.  Some are really hard and I have to cheat and ask my kids to help.  It is challenging though.
A10QQ9DRBG32S3 B007ZGO7EM 5 1360195200 20 This is wonderful!  Shows very large on my iPad and easy to see and operate.  I'm thrilled I purchased this.
A10QQ9DRBG32S3 B00BGC5UAG 3 1364947200 32 I haven't really gotten into this game much.  It seems very difficult, but maybe my mind is just old.  My son has progressed through several levels, but I'm still at the beginning.
A10QQ9DRBG32S3 B0066TUXU6 5 1364947200 33 I watched the 2 seasons of &#34;Downton Abby&#34; and loved it.  I'm going to look into more things to watch on my computer while my husband is watching what he enjoys on TV.
A10QQ9DRBG32S3 B004MC8CA2 5 1389052800 50 I love reading the Bible.  The YouVersion has every version available for one's preference.  Different study plans are available too.  The USA was founded on biblical principals and we need to get back to those principals & be the greatest country on earth.  God bless all who love His Word.
A10QQD7C9FMFZE B0073LHCCS 5 1356566400 34 I love this game!  It's very addictive.  I like word games and crossword puzzles, and this helps expand my vocabulary while each game is fairly quick so you can move up quickly!  Love it!
A10QRJ9NE8V1U2 B0080IOHLW 5 1338422400 25 It is a really fun game, a lot like tiny towers of which I love :) But they didn't have it for kindle fire :(
A10QRJ9NE8V1U2 B007XJ3D82 5 1354492800 66 This app is amazing I especially love how you can set a password for it but if you want the password to activate you have to hit the back button not the home button anyways definently get this app if your looking for a diary because unless someone knows your password thee is no way for them to see what you wrote love this app!! (3
A10QRJ9NE8V1U2 B007PTJOV0 5 1338336000 24 its just like Mario! its a ton of fun! I like it a lot and I would reccommend it to anyone who likes mario
A10QSQ2SISM67Z B008BMNGD2 2 1349740800 71 This could be fun but the way it is now it is just frustrating! As with many of the hidden object games there is no clue to how you play.  I love the hidden objects and hope the authors begin to include better instructions. I just saw this game is being sold for $3.99 on this review.  I bought it for .99 cents which was to much for what I got.
A10QSQ2SISM67Z B0064X7B4A 5 1367712000 62 As a staunch Scrabble player this game goes way beyond Scrabble! I love playing against unknown players as well as my friends. I have games with random players that have gone on since I started. Also you never know which words are considered legal or not. I would advise anyone who likes Scrabble to take a step up to Words with friends!
A10QTN8ERLQGPH B00881VLCE 4 1377043200 28 It's a great app to have when your looking for something different to do.  There is a good amount of puzzles. (20) but I wish there were more.
A10QTN8ERLQGPH B00B3WD78Q 4 1372723200 19 This game is fun to do a couple games each night.Give it a try.  I think you'll like it.
A10QTN8ERLQGPH B00FAPF5U0 4 1382313600 34 Wish I could find others that play but not through Facebook.  It's a fun game.  I seem to get stuck on certain levels and have to wait a day for more lives.  So sucky
A10QUNEBYKDB9I B0086700CM 5 1338076800 20 I have waited so so so long for this to come to amazon. i can finally play on my fire
A10QUNEBYKDB9I B0080IOHLW 1 1337904000 39 i want to love this game... its amazing. but its fatal flaw is the fact that it will randomly erase your save data from existence. -kindle fire user  *P.S. if they fix this then the game would be amazing
A10QV2ZIC2GQFX B00AHNC0SK 5 1393200000 32 Fun game. Plenty to do so far and you can actually get somewhere in it rather than taking thirty minutes waiting on one action. Great for the kiddos and fun loving adults.
A10QV2ZIC2GQFX B009HKL4B8 5 1393027200 30 Very Entertaining. And doesn't make you. Buy more coins or whatever every five minutes. Five more likely to spend on this than any other because you get your money worth.
A10QV2ZIC2GQFX B00BXPQN2K 5 1395878400 24 Fun and entertaining. What is really nice is the facet I do not need to be on line to play. Easy for the kiddos.
A10QV2ZIC2GQFX B008B84O6Y 4 1393027200 27 Fun game. Could use more axes to play before have to buy them.Great for kids and adults kept me busy until I quickly ran out of axes.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00BM8UNUQ 3 1393027200 35 If flo is in it....I'll play it.  If it's playfirst it's always fun.  This is a fun game.  Some of the other games in the playfirst games are better but it's still fun.  Have fun!
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00CO6TOBY 5 1393027200 42 I started playing this game on Nintendo...a long time ago.  I loved it then and I love it now.  Great game just kind of addictive.  This is one of those games that you just have to play until you level up.  Enjoy!!!
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00AK2RHR2 5 1393027200 45 I love the diner dash series...I've played this on the computer many times.  I just don't think they give you enough of a sample of these games.  There are numerous restaurants on this game and you only get to play one unless you buy it.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B006OCM13M 2 1393027200 38 Didn't like this game much.  All you do is tell it what to cook and when to serve and redecorate your restaurant.  I like games where you are more involved in the game.  These games practically play themselves.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00CH26TL8 5 1388620800 35 Starting playing this game to get more lives on Pet Rescue Saga but it is really fun to play.  Graphics are good and the themes for the different holidays are fun!!!  Good game for anyone.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00FEMJF6O 5 1404518400 54 I've been playing this game about a month....I really love it!!!! I like the way you have to open new areas and rescue the characters.  The only complaint I have is you have to earn so much money to open up the new areas.  The game has quests and that makes it more challenging.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00A37XD90 5 1393027200 115 I absolutely love this game and need friends.  Please add me...glendabutler.  I play daily so I will gift and help out every day.  This is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time.  I love not knowing what your going to dig up or have to do next for a challenge.  I wish they actually connected it to facebook so I could send friend requests.  Great game for 10 and up....because you have to do a lot of expeditions and it would probably be easier if you were at least 10.  Have a nice day!!!  Try this game it is free.  I have not spent one cent of real money.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B00C1PKO4O 3 1393027200 40 I like all diner dash series games...but they don't give you much of a sample for free.  I played this before on the computer and it has a great ending but I didn't want to buy it on the kindle.
A10QX5MK5P5SGS B009PSV1HE 5 1393027200 38 Love these games.  Try it but they don't give you many levels to play but if you really like it buy it.  This is one of the best series I've ever played.  I also like the chocolatier series.
A10QYB264X6SEF B00BW5K5DO 5 1384732800 43 This game is perfect for me. I'm not a gamer. I don't have mad skills. But I love Royal Envoy. Admittedly, I have been stuck at a certain level for a long time simply because I refuse jump ahead. Hey, it's not Frogger.
A10QYB264X6SEF B007VUA7VO 5 1360540800 46 For the Kindle dependant-the Battery HD is absolutely invaluable. Not only does it briefly interrupt my activity to notify me when my battery has reached a level(s) I set, but it also estimates the remaining usage for various activities: surfing, downloading, streaming etc. I love it!
A10R0GC3V48X8Z B00BFUUMO8 1 1362960000 46 I hate to have to wait. This isn't a game I want to play because everything takes to long to reset. Trying to upgrade  1 dinosaur took thousands of coins!!!!! If I have to log on ten time to progress a tiny bit not worth it.
A10R0GC3V48X8Z B00BJQKQH6 1 1362960000 38 I waited five min with the game up and it only got a fraction of the loading bar full. Finally set it to run in the background 30 min later not even half way Loaded. No thank you
A10R0GC3V48X8Z B007PT3QOQ 1 1333756800 33 the time for everything to regenerate goes out of sync my tomatos should only take 30 seconds to grow not 15 hours. same with my buildings and energy what a waists of time
A10R0GC3V48X8Z B00B4VI8MQ 1 1362873600 25 This game was way Too short and the game was too easy . Great soundtrack. Noworth the money it took to unlock the full version.
A10R31PK550ROK B009UX2YAC 5 1365206400 36 It is like so fun I like it then  I get bored of it tho. You should so get it...but one time I was at like 5,000 coins and it totally stopped I was like o.m.gurd
A10R31PK550ROK B00BG3ID0Y 5 1377648000 19 Awesome. It is so fun! I absolutely love it, it is a great game. You soshould definitely get it.
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B009S24P7A 2 1351641600 82 I like this app and I also like Charlie brown but while it was installing, I looked at the file size and it was about 80 MB! Usually, you can get good apps like this with good he quality for under 20 MB each. I saw a review that said that he or she got an error that said the file size was too big. this is probably why. no one ever looks at the file size, just the description and reviews
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B00AM1RL4A 2 1357689600 63 I downloaded this app because it seemed like an app like bike race, but 4 kindle fire. Right after i installed this app, webroot anti-virus software appeared and it said that the app was malicious, then it asked me if i wanted to uninstall the app, which i did. Such a waste of a valuable buck. Think before u get the app folks......
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B00A3WTXQ2 2 1353456000 23 this is a COMPLETE copy of happy poo jump. the only thing different is to person/animal jumping. but I do like the game
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B008TQ16OG 5 1359849600 31 EVERYBODY WHO IS SAYING THAT THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER IZ WRONG!!!! IT HAS BEEN UPDATED AND HAS MULTIPLAYER NOW SO U CAN LOG IN TO  FACEBOOK AND PLWY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!!
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B007XKEZ7O 1 1352419200 45 I used to love this game.  it is so fun to be able to draw with freinds. but now, this game erased all of the colors I had purchased for 250 coins each! and it also said I have zero word bombs. thanks ALOT omgpop!
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B0096DFBZQ 1 1349913600 22 just too much. no kids game app would require all of those. also this app contains MALWARE. DO NOT GET THIS APP
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B00AKEMHCA 5 1356912000 36 I love this app on Pc and it is even better on my kindle fire!!!!! oh yeah.....get this NEWER version of bloons td for $2.99 instead of bloons td 4 for $3.00!!!!! SAVE SOME MONEY!!!! hahahaha
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B007XKEY6Q 1 1347667200 42 This app was really fun and cool until now. Whenever I press the play button it says loading game but never does. I waited over five minutes for it to load. I have a kindle fire and this is getting really annoying
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B0086700CM 5 1351555200 63 this is the best game I have ever played. I just cant put it down! it is so addicting and fun! you can buy powrrups, new charactors, utilities and more to help you in the game. you collect coins during the game by tilting your device left and right. the more coins u collect the more items u can get from the store!
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B008O7EOEE 1 1348963200 62 this is a terrible app, especially for kids. basicly what you do in this game is throw ice cubes in peoples a**'s and get coins and points for doing so. I really don't get why this is number one in the free apps list. probably because the developer posts FAKE REVEIWS. DO NOT GET THIS PIECE O GARBAGE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B007VCVCAM 3 1350345600 57 I would have givin this app a five star, but it keeps crashing my kindle fire, and I have to revolt my kindle in order to exit out of the game. this mostly happens when the game says loading but never does. its ok I guess but its not worth getting if it crashes every five minutes.
A10R50NFHWRNM5 B009HQ9UHC 4 1350691200 41 I just bought the full version 2 days ago for three dollars. I wouldn't have if I knew the free one was going to come out today! but I still love the game. I think dis is better than angry birds
A10R5QFN2IVQV8 B0054JZC6E 4 1329782400 54 It's s fun games app. Just do not get why people complain about FREE app? If you do not like it, just uninstall! Acctually, I like the challenge to get more points to unlock the next game. Some games are challenging but some are completely boring. So, there are planty enough games for anyone.
A10R5QFN2IVQV8 B004DPCSKI 5 1329696000 36 omg this thing kreeps  me out but it said all what the heck was that supposed to mean this is the craziest thing I have ever downloaded in my life before it is so so ffffrrrreeeeaaaakkkkkyyyyy!!!!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!!!!!&iexcl;!!!&iexcl;
A10R5QFN2IVQV8 B00IKZX1ZI 1 1400371200 43 Great game until level 106! I was enjoying so much. even got my family to like it. but once I reached level 106, game started to freeze up and kindle started to malfunction. very upsetting! I hope creator will do something about it.
A10R5QFN2IVQV8 B008IXP8IU 4 1372550400 20 Very good game, keeps my mind working, however, some hints do not make any segood.Overall the game is very good,
A10R5QFN2IVQV8 B006HVARCC 5 1336694400 31 I compared this app with other similar apps for kindle and positively this is the best one so far. You can pick and choose colour, thickness of your drawing and ext.
A10R6EH9BR7C5D B0051UP5NQ 5 1339286400 30 I love this app now you don't have to lug the computer with you when you go out and need to work on word documents excel documents and Powerpoint documents
A10R6EH9BR7C5D B004T2QZL8 1 1340841600 31 this app is very bad before u do anything chage to child safe mode ithas u make cascade and when you mix a human and a human and it says sex
A10R7ROEG61DTR B00AHNC0SK 4 1394150400 46 Is a good game.It is not the best thing I've seen.But getting further gets you more money.Getting more money you can build more rides.And more rides gives more money.So it's just one of those things that are like build the best.But you should try it out.
A10R7ROEG61DTR B00JTKDTLE 4 1399680000 37 Not a 5 star game nor is the other 'don't touch the white title' but it's better than that.You should try it out its free I; like how it makes piano notes.It's definitely a 4 star game.

A10R8ET95TO9XU B00IKZX1ZI 4 1395619200 20 This game is very relaxing and addicting! I love the extra abilities we are given thru the kids with powers:)
A10R8ET95TO9XU B00CSR2J9I 5 1400457600 23 I like.the snowed scenes and the trees that get in the way. That's as far as I've gotten, but love it so far
A10R8ET95TO9XU B00529IOXO 4 1399075200 44 Text plus + calls really works. My friend and I call each other from the app and we can talk or text. It's kewl, unfortunately we can't hear each other real well and that is why I'm giving 4stars. Thanks for the app. :)
A10R8ET95TO9XU B0073V0FC2 5 1402185600 20 Very challenging to play at times yet exciting to eat fruit. I love this game! I rate it 5 stars!
A10R8ET95TO9XU B00JTKDTLE 4 1401494400 29 I think it's neat to hear different sounds with each black box that goes to a tune! Watch out tho, don't tap a white box or the game ends!
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B00850NK6I 1 1361145600 69 Used with Kindle Fire. Upon entering my info finding a library and sorting tediously through books available instead of being able to download your borrowed book in Kindle format it lead me to Amazons page where I accidentally bought the book.  It forces you to read it in your browser otherwise and is very misleading. Support is nearly non existent. Save the aggravation and just go to the library.
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B004GYY714 5 1340064000 65 Tune In Radio has been a blessing. I have it on my phone and Kindle. I cant sleep with out it. The selections are great. Its usability is wonderful for people like me who do not use i-products. My Grammy loved the stations and it eased her time in the hospital. If you cant find something that interests you on this tuner...frankly it doesnt exist.
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B00KMX5V8G 4 1405987200 23 Glad its finally on my kindle. The phone version is just too small. Though it seems my request get lost in cyber land.
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B00FELZD70 4 1396483200 43 good game play a little sketchy at first.needs a better longer tutorial. slightly repetitive but once you open other areas outside of the classic game its better. no need to make purchases. plenty of opportunity to gain rubies and money in the game.
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B009HKL4B8 1 1375488000 21 Downloaded for my Kindle Fire. Continually force closes. Can not open. :( Would love to play, if only it would work.
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B00FAPF5U0 5 1383436800 27 Finally Candy Crush is available for Kindle Fire. I couldn't be more pleased. Too bad it took so long to be available.  Get your crushing on! :)
A10R9QFEFYAUZW B005AKD836 5 1343779200 21 Excellent app version of the site, perfect for book lovers and sharers. gives great insight on something you are interested in.
A10RC2SBDSZJR1 B00HFTHXMC 5 1401235200 25 Great Game to play!  Love the beautiful and colorful background.  Makes you think about your moves before taking your shot.  Would recommend game to friends
A10RC2SBDSZJR1 B009XFDFPU 5 1388707200 26 Fabulous game and very addictive.  Played action mode once and starting on it again, also like puzzle mode and Zen mode.  Puzzle mode very, very addictive.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00CLVW82O 1 1368921600 31 If it soul allow me to continue past the free stage I'm certain it would earn 5 stars. I love Big Fish Game selections. I hope this gets fixed and soon.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B008EL25LE 5 1340755200 50 I am loving this game.  I bought it today and have played it for hours. I should have been in bed a long time ago but keep playing. that's avoid sign ofagood game. initially I balked at the higher price. the game quality has more than made up for it.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B008O661PK 5 1344556800 24 I love this game series. Gorgeous graphics. Great storyline. Plenty of help if you want get stuck. I can't wait for the next game.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00ATPVA78 4 1358640000 26 Great Game!I really enjoyed this game. I found it to be original. Different storyline. Would recommend. My only complaint was it was a bit too short.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B007R41E8O 5 1334188800 23 Love the graphics. the music. the puzzles. plenty of hints if hounded them. which I often do! one of the best tot kindle.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B0076POKVC 4 1330387200 44 Fun, different, and relaxing. I like the variety of puzzles. But wish it was longer.  Hope Nevsoft puts out more games like this. I did have one issue, though. Game would not load at first, but loaded fine today. I have a Kindle Fire.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B008DWM0QY 4 1340928000 51 I am totally enjoying this game. love the story and scenery. fun puzzles. only issue is it shuts down on occaision. but quickly is restored with nothing lost but a few seconds. this was the only reason I gave it a four rating. one of the best games in this genre.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00881VLCE 5 1339804800 43 Gorgeous images and hours relaxed game play. l was never a fan puzzles until I discovered games like this. you can start easy and work your way up or start with a bang. great additional puzzles for free or .99. Loving this game.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00ATDOVNK 5 1359763200 27 This is one of the better adventure hidden object games. We need more like this for Kindle Fire. Great story and excellent graphics. Bring on part two!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B0080SC22I 4 1337299200 70 I enjoyed this game. You can play it in a timed mode or a go at your own pace. I played the timed mode before realizing I had a nice. The story had me laughing ... goofy in a good way. I agree with what someone else said: try spell check for starters. Over all a good time. I just bought the next one. Maybe the spelling will be better.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B0085P2Z6E 5 1342310400 41 I really enjoy the games by this company. their hidden object adventures continue to improve. This game was the just-right balance of relaxing game play and feeling challenged. the zoom feature is great too. And ... you can't beat the price!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00E0NVX4U 5 1378425600 52 I am having a blast with this game! In fact I typically play multiple games at once to stay interested. Now and then one comes along that I enjoy enough to stay tuned in to. This is one of those games. Will look forward to part 2. Keep them coming Big Fish.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00B4VI8MQ 4 1360627200 22 I really enjoyed the game. Good graphics. Interesting story. Some the objects were hard to see. I mostly wish it was longer!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B0081TYN7S 5 1339977600 20 This game provided hours fun play. loved the locations. gorgeous graphics. fun puzzles. I am ready for part two now.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B006R8GK2Q 4 1327276800 22 I really enjoyed this game. Great graphics!_ Actually am enjoying the storyline. Wish there were more games like this for kindle fire.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00BC4I19U 5 1367539200 22 This is a colorful brisk game filled with tons of fun. Great for the entire family and free! That's hard to beat.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B008N04TMO 5 1344556800 28 I love this series! Great graphics. Fun puzzles. Nice continuation from the original game. Well worth it to play. looking forward to many more like this from G5.@
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00J4JZRQK 5 1397174400 26 I really enjoyed this game. Story was good, and so we're the graphics. Loved the &quot;shooting&quot; mini games for something different. Would buy a part two.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00CWGWAEE 5 1370217600 38 Entertaining adventure with awesome graphics and intriguing storyline. Wish that part two was available now! Need more mystery. would like a couple more hidden object scenes. Also got lost and turned around.  Still well worth 5 stars though!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00HJ4G1MQ 5 1392508800 39 I totally enjoyed this game. I'm hoping for a third installment in this series. Graphics great, story engaging, not too hard. Perfect after a long day. Would highly recommend to any f a n of adventure hidden object games.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B007A2IPF8 5 1329609600 22 I am really enjoying this game. I have all G5's hidden object games. love them all.  wish they'd come out more often.-
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00AIQP9DE 5 1356912000 31 Totally enjoyed this game. Awesome graphics and cool storyline. I didn't love the mini games but no biggie as you can skip without a long wait. Would love a part two.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B007T8Z5PG 5 1334361600 24 This game has it all. Well worth the money. Hidden object; puzzled; cool storyline; and awesome graphics. Love the included game manual.A must have!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B007ZD17XO 5 1336089600 22 This game is beyond addicting. Totally love it sound effects and all. Well worth the money. I ll be up late tonight.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00JRSXIZ0 5 1398729600 27 I was surprised by how much I found myself enjoying this game. Love the match 3 and bubble shooter games mixed in. Headed back to play more!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00C71OUJC 5 1365811200 25 Another homerun from Alawar. I watch for their releases and have yet to be disappointed. Great graphics and interesting storyline. Totally emersed in the game!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B008VRQNIC 4 1345766400 39 This a fun game with great graphics. so far I've been playing alone. no out on the web for me. my only complaint is it's a game that can cost money if you're impatient like me. Anyway I'm enjoying.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B00I3WTXCS 5 1391299200 34 I love this game! Works fine on my older Kindle Fire. The graphics are superb. The story is interesting. I'm totally lost in playing it. Often I get bored and delete. Not this time!
A10REDSTXMOEKV B009ZHQLHA 3 1352764800 22 Totally loving this game but it won't allow me to purchase when I reach the end of the free part. please help.
A10REDSTXMOEKV B008FF8PT0 5 1342137600 23 I'm really enjoying this game. Great graphics. Good story. Can't wait for part two. Only negative ... it is a huge space hog.
A10REK3XHCU8HT B008XG1X18 5 1351382400 21 The mobile website always drained my battery, but the app is much better. It's almost as nice as the regular website!
A10REK3XHCU8HT B007PW1BZY 4 1334188800 87 Almost as fun as playing with cards and friends, but some aspects are very inefficient. For example, if I'm supposed to play a run of 7 but I have a run of 9, I have to play the phase with the run, go back to the "table" and then go back to the "phase screen" to add the additional cards. Also there is a lot of wasted space the way the main table is laid out. I would like to see bigger cards and less empty space.
A10REK3XHCU8HT B008Y7SMQU 4 1348531200 30 I wish it would show the full logo after you guess it correctly. Also it would be nice if it could accept slight misspellings, like JC Penny for JC Penney.
A10RFAF1CGFKHZ B004SIIBGU 4 1390953600 49 It works well for watching and buying stuff. It's also a nice app to help remind you when certain items in your wish list are about to end. Putting stuff up for sale though.... I'd prefer using my PC instead.  It's a good app. No crashes to report yet.
A10RFAF1CGFKHZ B00D74DVKM 2 1392508800 191 The game looks just like the Sega Genesis release and is even slightly pixelated. This is NOT an enhanced version of the game. I gave this a low rating because it's a real pain to play it on my Kindle.  The big issue I have with it is that the virtual D-pad and jump button are actually located on the left and right side of the game screen.  This means your fingers will be covering up the front and rear side of the game!!!  TREMENDOUS FAIL.  How anyone can actually enjoy this when you can't see one inch in front or the back of the Sonic sprite, is beyond me.  The virtual D-Pad is also a bit finicky.  Kind of hard to maneuver Sonic without accidentally putting him in a crouched position.It would have been great is they provided a blank space for the virtual D-pad and jump button so that the game screen is not covered by your fingers.  That's my biggest gripe here and it ruins the entire experience of this game. I uninstalled :/ ...I also paid for it because there was no test drive option for it...
A10RFAF1CGFKHZ B00IF2JW8G 4 1397779200 40 I didn't know what to expect from this.  Just tried it and was amazed at not only how well it plays (responsiveness of controls, etc) but also how sweet the graphics are. Wow. Really great job with this one SOA.
A10RFAF1CGFKHZ B0084HDG8Y 4 1397779200 230 Out of all the pinball machines I've tested on this app, I found only 4 that really stand out .  My number one favorite is Attack From Mars. I managed to beat it's high score and received the grand master title after a couple of months of toying with it, lol.  It's a really impressive machine. Awesome design, not too hard, not too easy, loads of fun elements in it, etc.Another favorite is the one that comes in the app for free in &#34;My Tables&#34;. I forgot the name but it's a Genie in a lamp themed machine. Lot's of awesome elements and special effects.  3rd, I'm really enjoying the Terminator 2 machine right now. It's a little tougher but only about a notch above Attack From Mars.  Finally, I also like the Harley Davidson one. &#34;Live to ride!&#34;  That one isn't as tough. Very easy to raise high scores. It's a bit lacking in elements but it's still pretty solid and has fun video mode games as well as soundbites that make you smile.Outside of these machines I named, I found nothing but really dull and bizarre machines... Some seem quite incomplete or were just painful to the ears after a minute or two. Kind of home grown unlike the ones I named.Still, I'm glad I downloaded this app because the machines I love, make it totally worth it.
A10RFAF1CGFKHZ B004UBB1HQ 5 1390953600 114 It reads all my comics perfectly and I like how well the app arranges my books, per folder and issue number. The only draw back is not knowing how to remove the silly green icon after the book is read. I accidentally allowed them a couple times and I find it rather ugly when it's sitting right in the middle of each cover.  Also, I wish the book would restart itself when I'm done with it. Everytime I come back to a finished book, it brings up the last page I read. If only there were an option to deny this function.Aside from that, it's a real good reader. Hasn't crashed on me yet.
A10RGLUMUQC4P7 B008B88LEU 5 1340150400 26 I absolutely love this game. its addicting and easy to play. the only down side is you have to buy stuff to get more levels ...

A10RLC9BRM5Q2O B00AIQP9DE 5 1385337600 28 great game. the story is interesting and the puzzles are fun. lets face it...who doesn't like playing detective? G5 games do deliver. I keep coming back for more.
A10RLC9BRM5Q2O B00E5GJ7QS 5 1376697600 24 this is an easy to keep up with bingo-not to fast. not to slow. music is a little annoying but can be turned off
A10RLC9BRM5Q2O B00G5LQ5MU 3 1385510400 47 the blue wires already have me going bonkers and I don't want to pay for hints. I know I will end up doing it but I don't have to like it. I do love the game I just wish once in a while free would mean free.
A10RLC9BRM5Q2O B00B2TET3C 5 1376697600 33 this is one of my favorite games. if you get the chance to play it... you will love it.  I love the sound track and the auto daub. good luck and have fun
A10RLC9BRM5Q2O B008JJS6D2 4 1369699200 26 I'm not a bingo fan- but I find this one so much fun. the auto bingo is a great.feature.l would recommend giving this one a trym
A10RN92S0XE4G5 B004Z2VHAQ 3 1366156800 28 Its Ok . funny the first time.. after a while you get a few peolpe thinking the screen is broken.. Its free so i cant really complain ..
A10RN92S0XE4G5 B004UNX1LS 5 1366416000 87 Most Videos are in HD both on Tv and Amazon kindle. Brand new video are posted up all the time and its simple to look up videos by searching artist up.I also like the Vevo live though i dont always watch it, i do sometimes. you can look up music videos in different language too. But 1 downfall is, that you cant find underground music videos..  But you can get this vevo on your phone too or Roku as an App which is very cool..Its Also **Free***
A10RN92S0XE4G5 B0067VKQLE 5 1371081600 39 Love this Game its Keeps You hooked and its pretty interesting how you can switch this up by picking different plants and bonus games once you unlock them.. this Is a great game to buy very, very addicting ..
A10RO600A9DIS B004R1LNGS 3 1308441600 33 it seems like a pretty cool app. however, it asks me the permission to allow the app to erase all my data. can somebody explain why this app needs to delete my data?
A10RPOFRGZM0G7 B004HGK6FW 5 1334534400 24 I like sudoku so I like this app.  Its easy to pick up and play.  If you like sudoku, you should get this app.
A10RPOFRGZM0G7 B004SJ3AXI 5 1334534400 37 This game is fun and a nice challenge sometimes.  I was surprised by how good it looked on my Kindle Fire.  Very sharp & colorful graphics.  The controls are great too.  Haven't had any problems with it.
A10RPOFRGZM0G7 B004SJ3BCI 5 1334620800 59 I have this game on my iPhone, but I wanted to see how it was on the Kindle Fire.  Its looks and plays great.  I was burnt out on Angry Birds so I took a break, but now I'm back playing it again.  I haven't downloaded the new Space one yet though.  I'm still not finished with the original!
A10RPOFRGZM0G7 B0055SWM08 5 1349913600 34 This is a very neat puzzle game! Sometimes it lags a little, but it doesn't stop the gameplay from being fun. Very user friendly interface too. The music and graphics are also very nice.
A10RPOFRGZM0G7 B008Y0SERE 4 1390435200 31 It's not as good as Tiny Wings, but that game isn't available on the Amazon store so this game will stay on my Kindle Fire until Tiny Wings hopefully becomes available.
A10RV0FGPT0AYX B00CXVX1OQ 5 1378771200 155 Monkey Boxing is a pretty cool app for your android. It's my first sports or action game after trying out the strategy and precision games involving jewels, blocks, and chimpanzees, and what can I say but "nice job?" As a longtime avid reader who originally purchased a tablet to replace my broken e-reader device, I'm really happy to experience all the cool things out there for my tab. One of the opportunities I find to use my device is while waiting at appointments and such, so I've come up with a system. As I wait before a scheduled meeting, I have no problem reading, emailing, catching up with news and scores, or playing nice, peaceful little games. However, if and when the time has come and gone to begin the business at hand, yet it's not underway, I pity the primate that has to face my swift and powerful monkey in the meantime. Enjoy! :)
A10RV0FGPT0AYX B00632HWOG 5 1379030400 105 Yahoo! Mail is a solid app that you should definitely get if you prefer a stable, concise, dedicated mobile app for one of the world's most desirable email service providers. I love the interface's sharpness and contrast and the way that I works predictably in relation to its non-Android counterparts. FYI, at present, there's a tiny dynamic ad link at the top of the default inbox, but I'm not sure if that's the case for premium Yahoo! Mail customers. Yahoo! is really seems to be rolling out a lot of apps and features lately, and I can't help but be somewhat impressed with the results.
A10RV0FGPT0AYX B009XAJI8S 5 1379030400 129 So a few months back, I saw US TV Free featured on a technology website hailing it as a marvel of convenience and programming availability in the modern digital age or something like that. This app could very well be those things, but overwhelmingly, too many US television streams that correspond to my interests don't work right now. It could very well at some point be amazing if only because it gives you a mobile unified experience for all the up and running channel sources. The main reason why I rate this app highly, is in hopes with higher recognition, something like US TV Free will encourage streaming content providers to find new models the viewers love to use on the go (particularly in the US). Thanks for reading!
A10RV0FGPT0AYX B005ZXWMUS 5 1375228800 134 For me, it's virtually impossible (and somewhat pointless) to rate & review the Netflix app without mentioning the company's video service. As scores of TV and movie fans know, they offer hundreds of thousands of things to watch through their apps and new stuff rings in about 30 days post-release. This app dives right into the content once you type your credentials into your device. It's pretty simple. As a late-comer who was happily without a smartphone or tablet until April, I'm still making my trial runs through the various services to find my best fit, so while Netflix has come and gone for me at present, I can certainly say the app is not a letdown. Bonus points go to the Netflix app for its availability on each device on every major platform.
A10RV0FGPT0AYX B005EHQGTS 5 1374710400 128 I'm a relatively new tablet owner, and I'm thankful for Splashtop in a big way. I'd love to be able to choose hardware brands, form factors, and user interfaces of my choice to work on or enjoy my preferred software without proprietary borders. Well, the tech R & D and business landscape as a whole is not there yet, but Splashtop is a nice way to dream about it until the day arrives. Using this app on my tab and the companion software for my desk computer, I stretch the limits of my portable device by using traditionally desktop-only apps, watch flash-based vids on the open web, and all kinds of awesome stuff. If your network can pull it off, you're in good shape. Try it out. Peace!
A10S0C7EY6Z99 B0085P2Z6E 3 1357344000 123 First, I think you should be able to rename the character in the story. It makes no sense to put your name in for the game to only refer to you as Irene. Secondly, during many of the quests, items are hidden behind the status bar. How am I supposed to find them if I literally cannot see them? And the lists of items to find, I should be able to search the whole list. I've found myself with 5 items left to find and only able to see 1 on the list.... Really?I really enjoy games like this to help pass the time, but developers, PLEASE address these issues. As the game progresses, the things I've mentioned make the gAme almost unplayable.
A10S0C7EY6Z99 B00DYTKKGI 1 1384905600 29 Maybe it really is just for a little kid and there is no winning or losing for this. I kept and kept at it. Maybe I'm losing my touch?
A10S0C7EY6Z99 B004VCZW60 5 1389312000 95 This has helped me so much since I've gotten it. I am able to keep track of not only my cycle, but I can also add notes that can help me keep track of when my other health problems flare up. My doctors have always asked if my pain gets worse around the start of the worst 4 days of the month and I can say with certainty that it is not consistent. I've been using it so long that it have the start and stop days down pat. I recommend it for any woman.
A10S1CJ181K2I3 B008225GW0 5 1337731200 23 very cute. its fun to see them transform. wish there were other ways than buying jewels to get some of the dragons though.
A10S1CJ181K2I3 B0080IOHLW 5 1341273600 20 just started playing but this is very cute. I like that all the characters dance around.  really fun and cute
A10S1CJ181K2I3 B005UQ9FNC 4 1325635200 21 this cute my kid seems to like it a lot. kind of slow to get new birds though. its pretty fun
A10S301PTZ98VS B0091937MO 5 1400025600 26 It is fun.  You can save up coins and buy different flavored Ice Creams with it.  I enjoy this game and the graphics are so cute.
A10S301PTZ98VS B00J05XSGY 4 1400803200 44 Be careful, it is addicting.  Once you start it is hard to stop.  This is a fun game that you can use your brain with.  If you love numbers you will love this game.  If you like Sudoku this game is twice the fun.
A10SCASXDBFW0J B004LOMB2Q 5 1342569600 60 hey I love evernote!!!! Before this I was using notepad but moving on to evernote...one of the best choices I've ever made. On evernote you can have separate notebooks so now I don't have all my story chapters mashed together, they're organized!!! Also the bullets and numbers and bold, italics and underlines are something notepad didn't have. I love evernote!!!!!
A10SCASXDBFW0J B00A7HP4C0 5 1353974400 43 I have been waiting soooooooooo long for sky burger to come out for the kindle and suddenly its there!!!!!! Its a wonderful...sooooooooo addictive game for those of you who haven't played it before.....Just buy it guys! Its free. What'd you got to loose?
A10SFZKHMDN9SS B006OCM0G0 5 1376179200 22 slow at beginning and uses real time. get this only for people who have patience. make food, meet friends, chat, and more!
A10SFZKHMDN9SS B0060BE8I8 5 1358294400 31 it is really cool my friend loved it I downloaded it for her and its all she really loves because she loves dragons she said u get to become the dragon
A10SFZKHMDN9SS B00AEWUQG2 4 1359331200 23 it is pretty cool and if your one who says. I DONT DO MATH ON WEEKENDS then don't get this append of dicussion

A10SFZKHMDN9SS B00AEORXR0 5 1360108800 21 OMG I AB LUV THIS GAME AND I WUZ GUNNA LOOK 4 IT AND IT WUZ THARE AND I WUZ WOWD
A10SFZKHMDN9SS B00B5DLSMU 3 1374537600 25 i like the game but they have creepy adds..... i dont like creepy adds.. especially when they keep me up at night... i scared... D=
A10SFZKHMDN9SS B009HKL4B8 4 1358208000 24 I like this game but they put the ads in the most idiotic places CANT THEY JUST PUT THE FREAKIN ADS IN OK SPOTS
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B00BGAZYLI 3 1374451200 24 This game is fun and interesting but is not very challenging most of the time. You get one challenging puzzle for approximately every 10!!!!
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B006D1ONE4 5 1374451200 39 I love playing this game. It takes logic and patience (at times). It has fun characters and great graphics for being such an inexpensive game! I recommend it for anyone who likes logic puzzles or just a cute challenge!
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B00DJFIMW6 3 1374969600 58 This game will challenge your patience if you like to start a game off slow so that you can get used to it. However, if you like a game that will challenge you right from the beginning, you will enjoy this game immensely. The minions are adorable and it is hard not to love them from the beginning.
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B009KS4XRO 5 1385683200 31 This is a great game especially if you love bingo or slots. I wish that the cards cost less bingo credits but that is just because I run out so fast.
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B00CH26TL8 5 1375660800 74 This game gets more and more difficult as time goes on but is fun to play. I just wish that there were other ways to get coins to buy items. It does not seem that anyone ever thought about the fact that someone may not have friends that play the game nor that they are willing to pay REAL money for virtual coins! However, it really is a great game that I will play!
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B00E78QIDE 4 1377302400 24 This game is very challenging and can be fun for the whole family.  If you are easily frustrated though, it is not for you.
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B00D2XD5JU 4 1377993600 37 This game is always giving a new challenge and new boosts making it a fun game. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is the graphics are slightly old looking which should be upgraded.
A10SGQOVL1C4Z6 B00E1GOGJK 4 1383868800 23 So far this game is fun but easy. The pictures are unique at times and neat. I am enjoying it to this point.
A10SHT27TKYIRP B00COVCV50 5 1388102400 21 I SEEM TO ENJOY THIS GAME BUT I WONDER HOW LONG I WILL BE CLEVER ENOUGH TO CONTINUE. Time will tell.
A10SHT27TKYIRP B00BWBHIUG 5 1387929600 29 NICE GAME&iexcl;!!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!! !!!! !!!!!! !&iexcl;!!!!!!!!# !!!!!! I don't have enough to say about the ha and our err than I enjoy playing this type of game.
A10SHT27TKYIRP B00CLVQ8GG 5 1384214400 21 Awesome and great game to play BINGO. One of the best-selling free games of BINGO that I could find to enjoy.
A10SHT27TKYIRP B00AMEFZ72 4 1384128000 23 I ENJOYED PLAYING THIS VERSION OF WILD BINGO. ALL OTHERS WILL LOVE TO PLAY THIS BINGO. GO WILD WHEN PLAYING THIS WILD BINGO.
A10SM5T1V26EKI B0050QV0RQ 5 1317254400 26 This game definitely brings back memories of FinalFantasy can't wait to play it more. Great job Dec.If your looking for a great RPG this is it.
A10SMUT7KPOMA0 B00AQ5A88S 3 1364428800 22 Original coin dozer offers more distractions in prize and coin drops. Seasons levels are easier to hit and the graphics are cute.
A10SMUT7KPOMA0 B00A757EFW 3 1366848000 49 This simulation of the old arcade favorite loses something in translation. The pac-man is a little difficult to control on a small screen and the lack of a joystick makes evasion a little tricky. It was okay, but having played the original it was too sluggish in finger response.
A10SMUT7KPOMA0 B00H90NQG4 3 1393891200 28 This set of slots are a good distraction. You get that video quality movement and sound. The bonus rounds are quick and sometimes (I think) they cheat! (LOL)
A10SMUT7KPOMA0 B00COQOUE0 3 1372032000 25 Fun for those who enjoy finding hidden objects. Perfect for beginners. Some of the screens are busy which gives a little challenge and no frustration.
A10SMUT7KPOMA0 B008VRQNIC 3 1360108800 20 Storyline for finding hidden objects is a little slow moving. Good graphics. Movement between past and present a little confusing.
A10SMUT7KPOMA0 B00881VLCE 3 1366848000 22 While the puzzles are cute, they are not very challenging. It's a quick passtime or something that is more suitable for children.
A10STA2PTXCOI7 B009S980KG 4 1356739200 28 I am always playing before and after work and before and after I sleep. nice interactive. game. I feel like a pilot traveling to different States and countries
A10STA2PTXCOI7 B00AOA9BL0 5 1364083200 27 I am able to download various shows and movies to watch lawyer at work. Able to watch movies I have not seen since my daughter was young
A10STA2PTXCOI7 B008Y2FRFO 5 1349654400 23 thecoin dozer is too fun yet addictive. I just can't stop. I play this game almost everywhere. reminds me of chucky beeswax game.
A10STA2PTXCOI7 B004SJ3BCI 5 1334620800 28 very fun very fun very fun very fun, keeps me busy. I cannot stop playing. very challenging,  this game can make you angry,sometimes , but then I win.
A10STA2PTXCOI7 B008JK6W5K 5 1344816000 26 very fun and challenging. hard to put Down . when i see the logo somewhere, i write it down for later or start the game again.
A10STEWACFWSLD B0071APYJY 1 1372550400 29 This app is terrible.  Why can you not look at the menu and then order?  It assumes you know exactly what you want when you bring up the app.
A10STEWACFWSLD B004DLNC4I 1 1376697600 25 Can not even pick up the city I live in and I am three blocks from fire, rescue and police.  Waste of time and money.
A10STEWACFWSLD B0063IH60K 4 1375142400 20 After 5 Months had to uninstall and reinstall. Too many adds. New ad every game. Great for serious solitude players.
A10STEWACFWSLD B007SYXJ2C 3 1361059200 22 Entertaining app but menu leaves out many instructions on how to play the game.  Can only earn 9 max on bonus colors.
A10SY1K94IHOVY B00992CF6W 5 1357257600 44 I'm a 10 year old girl and I love this game. its so awesome bcuz I made a tower so high it wont go any higher! its also awesome bcuz there r many blocks and things to choose from!!! p.s. I love Harry potter!
A10SY1K94IHOVY B00G9B1MEM 5 1384214400 41 this game is so great for my daughter who is 9 years old. it teaches her about creativity and imagination!  its also so much fun for her. even I tried it and she had to take her kindle away from me!
A10SY1K94IHOVY B009HKL4B8 4 1388966400 72 Ok for the Kindle Fire..this app lies about its MB's! it says its 12.1MB but once u open the app it says &quot;Is it ok if we run this app with 213MB?&quot; and its like NO because ya know I have other games and I would have to get rid of half my IMPORTANT apps just to get Sims..its ridulous..I mean don't get me wrong its a good game and all but...ya
A10SY1K94IHOVY B009UX2YAC 5 1351641600 47 this game is kind of like temple run but even better because there are more opticals and more fun and creative. it is great because you would think it would be boring but its not. when I first played this game I thought it was very colorful.
A10SY1K94IHOVY B004SCEUXE 1 1321747200 22 I love starwars and all but this game is completely pointless! Even though this is free,  don't get it. This game BLOWS!!!
A10SY1K94IHOVY B00FB13Y74 2 1397433600 39 ok so I got this app on my Kindle Fire. it looked fun. it was very laggy when I first got it...I only got to play 2 practice races that SUCKED because the app would shut down on me
A10SY1K94IHOVY B00CTXY8RC 4 1382918400 43 the only doubt is that people always get in relationships ( dating) I even saw this one guy ask a girl for her #. so she gave it to him and then he asked her to flash!!! who does that?!?! obviously she didn't
A10SY1K94IHOVY B00B2V66VS 4 1361404800 52 Whenever I try to play the app does not 'load' and it shuts down the whole app and brings me back to home.......but other then that its a really cool app.... before the 2nd one came out I started to the subway sufers is better and now I totally regret thinking that!
A10SY74PJCS268 B009JNXK88 4 1355875200 39 Interesting Old-style graphics make this a nice to play game.  Sometimes though it can be hard to control your guy/spy good enough to get him where you want without dying.  I liked the idea and game play was fun.
A10SY74PJCS268 B006WFM7U8 4 1335225600 119 I really, and actually, do like this game.  I do have to admit - as have other customers mentioned in their review - that the graphics are simple, the controls are hard to manage and get the ball to go *exactly* where you want it to go, there are no instructions, and the background sound is kids-y and kind of annoying.  But really, it's a pretty interesting game and addictive. The levels are quite different so far as I have seen and the game play is pretty intriguing and I have found myself having to come up with new strategies to accomplish the levels.  But for a $1.00, what do you expect, and at least it doesn't contain OpenFeint!
A10SY74PJCS268 B00CDV6WDS 1 1374710400 188 I saw that it only had Open Network Sockets permission, I've seen this before and with only 1 permission I thought 'great'.  I usually keep my internet off unless I am using it so that I control - as much as possible - what information is sent across the internet to whomever my apps might.  But to require internet access in order to even play!?! That is just ridiculous.  I selected the app to open, and I see it barely open just to immediately hit me with a message that it requires an active internet connection in order to run and then it shuts down.  Say What?!?  I immediately distrusted this app and could not even give it a try.  Anything that does not allow me to control what access to my phone it has is not worth it.  So just beware, it requires an internet connection and will not run without it, and as such I don't trust it and I would caution you all to as well.  I just question what the developer is doing behind my back with my phone information when it is connected.
A10SY74PJCS268 B0078GZ1HG 1 1378944000 120 I loved this app, having bought it as the Free App of the Day.  Great graphics, good and exciting game play, challenging levels.  But after the OS update to Ice Cream Sandwich on my Galaxy Nexus S, it stopped working.  It would pull up a black screen as it opened and then I would get a message that the app had crashed.  Nothing I tried worked.  So I uninstalled it until Jelly Bean came out.  Then I tried to reinstall it and try it again.  But no avail, it still did not work.  There has been no update to the app, no changes to try out.  So alas, it has stayed uninstalled.  Sorry MiniClip, I really did like this app.
A10SY74PJCS268 B00F8GYC1Y 2 1399334400 95 It looks visually fantastic and I was looking forward to trying it out.  But as it was downloading I got a look at the massive list of permissions it requires and a couple of the permissions were *very* questionable as to &#34;why would they need this!&#34; As such, I did not and will not install it.  Sorry Rovio, there's no need to have access to my camera.  All I want to do is play the game and I do not care to post my score or anything from the game online.  Just let me play.
A10SY74PJCS268 B00768WTXA 2 1360195200 213 While I do admit that this has pretty stunning graphics and is kid safe, it gets to my patience quite fast.  I played the first level and then my 8 year old daughter took over and it entertained her for a few levels.  But once you get the obvious ones (as others have commented most of the images to find are butterflies - which did not bother me) they get really hard really quick.  In fact you get down to the last handful and they are literally impossible to find.  I found a couple by clicking all over the screen and happened to click on one.  My daughter got a little frustrated at times trying to find the last 2 or 3.  That part of the game could be improved, and they have methods in place to prevent you from clicking all over the place, because if you do click faster than once a second a message appears blocking the pressing of the screen and warns you about doing so.  The other problem I have with it is the massive and pervasive permissions that this kind of game does not need.  I definitely will be playing this in airplane mode or will be turning off ALL radios - I just don't trust it.
A10SY74PJCS268 B007FJFDXS 3 1360195200 20 Interesting concept for a game, however, controlling the cube can be difficult at times.  But it is fun and enjoyable.
A10SY74PJCS268 B006GWE5PM 4 1350432000 70 This is a wonderful game.  I love the great 3D graphics and the gameplay.  The first few levels are pretty easy to accomplish with multiple strokes under par, and then get gradually harder.  At the higher levels the AI plays pretty tough and almost impossible to beat, since it appears to hit all the perfect shots and make no mistakes.  Great game for all ages and wonderful enjoyment for all.
A10SY74PJCS268 B0090YHSFC 4 1355875200 140 I enjoy Penguins, they are wonderful creatures, and this game is a nice variation of your slicing game that involves them.  The object is to slice of enough of a predetermined amount of ice to fill some drink/cup on the side.  You must keep all the Penguins together and cannot slice a chunk of ice that separates them.  You can and are supposed to - in higher levels - slice and separate the Penguins from a Walrus, which was fun.  This game gets hard pretty quick and can be a challenge slicing off enough ice to complete the level with the Penguins bustling around as much as they do, with extra challenges as you progress to try and only slice 3 times in order to get the full 3 stars on some levels.  Fun game, good graphics, and challenging levels.
A10SY74PJCS268 B004HX4RT6 4 1355875200 63 This is your basic Chess game - at least that's all I play it for, to play against the computer.  There are other game modes, but I am not that knowledgeable of the variations of Chess to care to play those other modes.  The graphics look good and the game play is smooth and very playable.  It's fun and I enjoy playing it.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B00AIQP9DE 4 1356998400 37 I like games like this. I had to buy the full version to get through the game. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it didn't take but just a few hours to complete it.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B006OCM0G0 5 1350604800 78 I like this game..the prices are not real high..I play Bakery Story also and they have gone up on everything..I figure that will probably happen on this game too but for right now it is the better game for your time spent playing. I like that I have neighbors to play along and there are no interruptions by ads. Watch out if you let young children play because it will take real money so child proof your device.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B0062R5GJ0 1 1365552000 35 I put all my appointments in this thing. Then it would not let me access the monthly view about a week later. I could only see one day at the time.  I just deleted it.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B005EYWT38 4 1339286400 28 Nice to have so I ca get to sleep faster.It does helpI have tennitis so with this it drowns out the buzzing and I like the nature sound.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B009OYODAG 5 1350604800 29 Love my Restaurant story ...so this will be even better. I am glad I found it..I was worried that kindle users were going to be left out. Happy Halloween
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B004I744AS 5 1344297600 22 Great app .... highly recommended ...  I was surprised at the little extras. I haven't thought of hangman in a long time.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B00881VLCE 5 1355097600 73 Love the fact that I can do a puzzle without wondering where to put it. I did puzzles all the time but had to keep moving them when I needed the space. All the good places with good light are used often. With my kindle I never have to worry about light and I don't have to store the puzzles in my closet.With this app being free how could it get much better?
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B008JJS6D2 4 1346457600 24 If you like bingo. It is entertaining.A nice little game to get through the day when you have a lot of waiting to do.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B0080IOHLW 4 1343347200 35 Entertaining.....so many games have a  different appearance same concept that is.....If you don't spend money all the time come back tomorrow to keep playing.This game doesn't bore me so far. I just started playing today.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B0085VR7WU 5 1349222400 23 Nice game I enjoy playing. A great time waister. It is worth getting . I waited to send my review to make sure.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B004H6WTJI 5 1350432000 86 This is very helpful to really watch what you eat..There are so many things to eat out there that could blow your day in one setting. Let me tell you once you find out how many calories are in some restaurant foods you will never eat it again. Tracking food is the best way to keep from overeating or undereating which is so easy to do when cutting calories. That will make your body go into starvation mode and you can't lose permanent weight that way.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B009OYOASG 5 1350604800 37 I love the costumes. the text box is orange and the outside of the Bakery has the halloween theme.nothing else is different when playing the game. It is worthwhile to download the theme if you play already.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B00846F1YW 5 1360713600 73 If you are looking for a hidden object game then this one is about as good as it gets.fun extra puzzles. I got it free so that makes it even better. No money needed to play so it is a full game not a trial version. It is timed so you have to complete your mission in that time or you have to start over. Might be difficult for the younger age group.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B009PSV1HE 3 1351382400 42 I loved playing this game on my computer. I saw that it was available on my kindle ..I downloaded it and found it was just a trial version. You can purchase it and I might. I just hate to purchase it again.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B004DPIEF6 4 1351036800 94 Reviews are better than the app so it was worth the purchase price of zero..Got my money's worth. Gave it a 4 rating because the reviews were soooo funnyMy radar said I had a flat tongue and the police were going to act at the store. That is what I got from : police, store, act, tongue, flat. Love it...great timing for halloween. Don't let it creap you out it's just entertainment. Laugh a little. Keep the cool reviews commingled...oh...wait...incomming...message : Whatever you do give it your all...except when you are giving blood. hahahaha{^_-}
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B008PB2ZVI 5 1344556800 22 I love to try to figure things out but some of these floors are tricky..could not have done it without the guide.
A10SZFVPSF18R8 B008MM9630 4 1356825600 84 It is an ok game. I just pop in a couple of times a day and harvest my trees..work on some goals..then leave.. it is not really a time consuming game for me. I really don't get into watching grass grow. At first it was real fun but my plot of land is too full to put anything else on it and I can't get any bigger without spending money. I did buy some items but just don't see spending money on land expansion.
A10T1CZDXSTGJ0 B00D9SC4TA 5 1371081600 31 if u want fun u gatta cheak this app out and the best part is ITS FREE liv it if u don't like this app u got somethin' wrong with u

A10T1QVNCUV5TP B0071PS7AC 2 1330992000 74 This was obviously made to steal peoples' information.  It nothing more but a luck game.  Some would disagree with me, but I am saying this because when I roll the ball to the side it comes back and strikes.  But when I roll in a straight line to strike, it just rolls to the side.Also, the game level is preset to hard!  It virtually impossible to beat this game.Now think about downloading this app...
A10T1QVNCUV5TP B008841TP0 1 1341100800 44 Three words: Roblox is better!This app is just like minecraft, that's mostly why I hate it. And I'm a roblox user and fan! :PBy the way my user name in roblox is: Mimillovad so add me as a friend if you also hate minecraft
A10T1QVNCUV5TP B004O3YGMC 5 1325808000 75 YOU! Should buy it! Now whenever I need to access a file in my computer and I'm at my friends house or ar school I can just simply start the program and WALA! I've got a program fully capable of mimicking the actions of my computer or shall I say a computer fully capable of mimicking the gestures I input on my Kindle Fire. One last thing to say ...BUY IT! IT'S WOTH THE MONEY!
A10T1QVNCUV5TP B006DJ2JSI 5 1325721600 50 Free, fast, and speaks! What else do you need! My Kindle Fire brought a dictionary pre-installed but its a failure. When I look up a word and it taks about 6 minutes to completely search the dictionary. It's so much easier with this app. I give it two thumbs up!
A10T1QVNCUV5TP B007JPG04E 5 1332115200 53 It's not just the graphics but the actual story mode.  I mean, it's just so different from all the other games.  It has a long story mode, lots of guns, high graphics (for a tablet), and it will keep you exited the whole way!  If I could give it a 10 I would.
A10T3US0VHZZZI B0052OSTOS 5 1391558400 37 This is seriously one of my absolute *favorite* apps. It actually works. Was *really* skeptical at first that it would. But it has consistently helped knock me out for sleep every time I use it. It's fabulous.
A10T3US0VHZZZI B004Z9Y3VY 5 1313625600 107 I prolly would have given a 4 star because I've done the whole red button thing on the internet years ago, and it was funny as hell back then when it was fresh, shiny, and new. But I gave it 5 stars to try to counter the negative nancys reviewing this app. I noticed the developers of this app added a couple new bits that take advantage of a smartphones touchscreen capabilities, that of course could not be available for a PC.This app is great for a good laugh. Don't take life so seriously, Nancys. Try to enjoy life a bit without giving yourselves an ulcer ;3
A10T3US0VHZZZI B0058VW36U 5 1317168000 27 Homg, the little frog/monster is so cute. I love this game! How could *anyone* give it 1-star. Thanks for putting this up for free for us Amazon!
A10T3US0VHZZZI B00685VI98 5 1322179200 56 What a cute and innovative game! You can tell the developers put a lot of love and care into this fun lil app, which is why it completely befuddles me to see all these low-star ratings. Luckily, I'm not an idiot and actually tried out this fun, clever little game and am enjoying it immensely ^^
A10T6SEBEEZD2I B00696GNC8 1 1324598400 26 Didn't have a chance to see it work. Force closes at start up on my phone.  Maybe ill try it on a new device some year.
A10T87EYLJN5UF B008225GW0 5 1340064000 45 My grandson plays this all the time and loves it.  glad I purchased it for him.  All the games that I have gotten from Amazon have been great.  I have to share my Kindle Fire with him so my reading time is really cut down.
A10T87EYLJN5UF B004LZFWJO 5 1391385600 39 I enjoy this game and so does my grandson.  It is a fun way to pass some time.  Can't seem to get too many points but my grandson is so much better.  I would recommend it to all ages.
A10T87EYLJN5UF B0090YHSFC 5 1353888000 23 My great grandson loves this game and plays it all the time.  both of us are happy with it.  Glad we purchased it.
A10T8XGBYU7886 B00FAS0MY6 5 1403827200 36 I really like this game, many games that I've played  like this really sucked but this one has great artistry, story line and the gaming is awesome. I wish all games like this were this good.
A10TEQVBJMF7C6 B00BWBHIUG 2 1390867200 23 I believe this is an APP for children, I purchased this in error.  I would really prefer to remove it from my Kindle.
A10TFP98A48R39 B009WO7NQO 5 1353974400 84 Great job Rovio, made another amazing game, I love almost everything about it. Except the fact that I have to pay for the return of the Jedi levels. but other than that, gameplays great, nice graphics,creative ideas, and everything you would expect out of rovio. the other thing I don't like, is the lack of levels, but I can live with that since the game is addicting as it is.  So long story short, keep up the good work rovio, but add more levels
A10TFP98A48R39 B00FYEPQWO 5 1386720000 24 this game is a great gun simulator and its really fun and cool. I highly suggest getting this game and giving it a try.
A10TFP98A48R39 B00B2V66VS 5 1359158400 49 Here's a list of things I like and don't like:like:1:The amazing graphics2:The new features like ziplines or minecarts3:One big demon monkey instead of 34:The new obstacles and powerups5:The new gem systemdon't like:1:The lack of warning of obstacles when in mines2:The lack of gems3:the lack of original and new characters
A10TFP98A48R39 B004SJ3AXI 5 1325635200 47 This game is very addictive. To be truthful I spent 3 nonstop hours playing Angry Birds seasons, it never grows tired. There are always new updates so there is always something too work on. And the episode names are pretty great puns. Angry Birds is awesome, period.
A10TFP98A48R39 B00F8H0LM2 4 1385337600 27 duckz are cool they have feet. and can swim. their bills have nothing on them. dux are the ultimate animal. Ducks will take over the world. HAHAAAAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAGA.
A10TFP98A48R39 B00AIUUXHC 5 1364169600 74 I've played the other hungry shark games, and they were ok, but this puts a whole new name on FGOL. This is not just a game, but a friggin awesome game! you get new sharks, upgrades, decorations for your sharks, and amazing graphics. Now I've read some of the reviews, and they've said their games' have reset. I just hope FGOL notices this and fixes it before it happens to other people or me.
A10TFP98A48R39 B0080K98U0 1 1352937600 69 Seriously if you want to get anywhere in the game you have to pay money. Not to mention its pretty hard to grasp. and you need wifi for some stupid reason. This is only typical gamevil, making crappy games to steal your money. AND also the bribing too. I. bet the only reason its five stars is because they BRIBED them too. This game is just degraded and terrible
A10TFP98A48R39 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383177600 47 Candy Crush has always been a game that I have dreamed of coming out on kindle, and now, that dream is a reality. And a good one too! Candy Crush is definitely a fun game that I can play before I hit the hay. Thank you King!
A10TFP98A48R39 B004SJ3BCI 5 1355875200 46 its an overall great game, I just don't see any real good reason not to like the game. good fun, nice graphics, nice everything. I think Rovio did a great job on its most original game, plus it was the first I downloaded. Great job rovio.
A10TFP98A48R39 B00A757EFW 4 1355875200 75 well, its pac-man all right! an old-fashioned, well put together game. I like it a lot, simple task and goal not much too it. Great for a quick-paced timekiller. its a nice game but it does have a couple downs. I am not sure if its just me, but this game gets REALLY boring REALLY fast. that's the only thing I don't like about it. otherwise its an ok game. old yet crazy fun. lol
A10TFU3UEDJFTL B00HCMG6LG 5 1395014400 25 This app is an awesome way to keep your brain sharp!  Find the objects you need to escape, then figure out how to use them!
A10TFU3UEDJFTL B00B9AGS42 2 1395878400 43 I love the game except it crashes every third screen or so.  At the beginning load up, there are two to three ads that pop up before you can even begin.  The game itself is great if I could play it without interruptions.
A10TFU3UEDJFTL B00FAPF5U0 5 1393977600 20 I spend hours with this app, its so fun!  Each level is different and can be accomplished.  Try it yourself!
A10TFU3UEDJFTL B00IYOACQ6 5 1395792000 29 A great way to exercise the brain. Finding the clues can be easy, but using them can be challenging! Try it. You'll see! Definitely a game for the thinking.
A10TFU3UEDJFTL B008R9OIUO 2 1396742400 55 Great game for someone who can think outside the box.  Some words appear hidden as words, not as  objects.  Some descriptions tell what the object does, not the name of the object.  Some descriptions tell you what to do.  I haven't figured out how to redo a level, it keeps going to the next level.
A10TI2QTQOOXMX B00BGAZYLI 4 1371686400 20 This makes learning fun for children. But there are so many other things that interest them these days and times.
A10TI2QTQOOXMX B00BHHIWQO 3 1371686400 22 No comment! I am so busy reading and playing other games that I do not have enough time to play this game.
A10TI2QTQOOXMX B0094BB4TW 4 1371686400 25 It's nice to check my facebook when I am out but I can not always pull it up when I want to chat with others.
A10TKFT731ANOP B007SYDYLS 5 1378339200 20 the free one was so much fun that I hurriedly bought the other one. I really do like this game.
A10TL5MYMMS3IE B00846HN02 1 1342137600 45 Can someone please explain.  Why do I need an intrusive app to tell me how to barbeque?Put meat on hot grill.  Drink beer. Wait.  Drink beer.  When meat is burnt on the outside and raw in the middle, it's done.  Drink more beer.  Simple, really.
A10TL5MYMMS3IE B0065AFQSU 1 1323129600 24 I can't seem to get this off my list, how do I remove it?  Is Amazon bloating the cloud?  I did not purchase this.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B0052AZJV8 4 1337212800 24 I can chat with my family and friends that's enough for me. I think it could use some tweeking but im no geek. thanks
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B004XJKUJ0 5 1338163200 21 Love the verses each day as they help keep me instep with my Savior. Hes all I need ever and ever.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B0084DYNGC 5 1338508800 23 I love hidden object and this can be a challenge. take your time and just relax and enjoy yourself in a beautiful scene.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B004MC8CA2 3 1340409600 29 Would give a higher star but I need Wifi to use it at my church so this isn't good for my usage there. I do use it at home.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B0087TQYUG 3 1340582400 42 I really do love this game but the coin system needs some major changes. can't afford real money to buy those extra coins. please change this. I think I could give this a 5 star but needs work here. thanks for listening.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B006C8EVHM 5 1342483200 27 Playing alone with pressure to no pressure is great. I enjoy this quiet time to myself and just enjoy playing this game as if im playing boogle.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B0054JZC6E 3 1334620800 20 enjoy playing the games and love the bow and arrow best. directions in playing some of themm could be better.
A10TPJVNP2U4Z6 B005RXEXP8 2 1343347200 26 And it wont let me sign in. I enjoy winning the rewards wheel but I need new cards and back grounds. please do something about this.
A10TQJHFR5E7U B00BHHIWQO 4 1367712000 22 While I like this game, I don't play it very often.  It is fun and a great way to pass the time.
A10TQJHFR5E7U B004JJXVYK 5 1367712000 33 I loved playing this game as a child.  My friends and I would play it quite often back then.  Now I get to play it on my Kindle Fire!  Great way to relax!
A10TQJHFR5E7U B00B5DLSMU 4 1367712000 45 I have always enjoyed playing word games. It would be better for me if you could play this game without competing againt friends.  Most of my friends don't enjoy playing games and I have to hope some random stranger is willing to play against me.
A10TQJHFR5E7U B004LZIZHU 5 1367712000 23 I really enjoy this type of game.  There are many others that are similar with diferent objects to swipe.  Great way to de-stress!!
A10TQJHFR5E7U B0064TVQ5E 5 1367712000 21 This is a lot of fun to play!  I love trying to match up the tiles as quickly as I can.
A10TQJHFR5E7U B00A757EFW 4 1367712000 31 I used to play this game years ago and was happy to see it again.  I don't play this as often as I thought I would, but it is still fun!
A10TQJHFR5E7U B0063IH60K 5 1367712000 55 I have always loved playing Solitaire.  My dad taught me how to play when I was much younger.  He used to sit on the living room floor with a deck of cards and play for hours.  I did too until I got my Kindle Fire and now I can play it on there all day!!
A10TQJHFR5E7U B005HSL626 5 1367712000 48 My boyfriend's granddaughter has this game on her tablet and she loves playing it with me.  So, of course, when I got my Kindle Fire for Christmas from him, I was pleased to find this game on there.  Now I practice to try to beat his granddaughter!  lol
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B0087HEQ6M 3 1339718400 27 this game is really fun and it can take up a lot of your time. I just wish that you could start off with a fast taxi.
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B00A3E2BVE 5 1354060800 21 omg I love this game ... its better to guess songs then guessing pictures that people draw badly ^_^ but yeah
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B0080IOHLW 5 1338163200 38 this game is a lot of fun, but the only thing I don't like is that you have to get 60 coins just to upgrade your elevator. other then that this game is much fun and passes time
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B00846GKTW 5 1337990400 22 this game is really fun to play at anytime and anywhere but I am stuck on the Hollywood one HELP please anyone
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B006PH7WBM 5 1331683200 25 love this game......it is totally amazing, how everything is made....Ive always wanted to sell clothes and since I'm too young..I can play on the game
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B008K3OOJM 5 1345680000 28 well I juster started this game and it seems really fun. so far I haven't kill any of my fish lol. I hope I never do also lol
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B00998UF9U 4 1350691200 22 This game is really fun. I like that it has to deal with magic and it has some really pretty clothes also.
A10TRK3Z2AFT3M B007TXUZ1U 3 1339286400 22 this game is really fun but I was hoping for something more to where you can like babysit or something like that.
A10TV3VAIFSB32 B0076ANQQC 4 1332115200 23 this is a fun game for little kids my niece really likes it she is 19 months old and likes all the animals
A10TV3VAIFSB32 B00BPC23XO 4 1367712000 20 I like this app better than the rest because it gives you the &quot;skip&quot; option it is so much fun
A10TV3VAIFSB32 B00DLJ31HQ 5 1377388800 26 this game is lots of fun my family like to play it with each other. my brother and sister like to play to with me too.
A10TV3VAIFSB32 B0086700CM 5 1338508800 20 this game is awesome my lil bro and sis love to play this game we play it all the time
A10TV3VAIFSB32 B004U75OYG 5 1340323200 20 I really like this game its lots of fun my little brother (9 years old) loves to play it too
A10TV3VAIFSB32 B0073V0FC2 4 1332115200 23 this game is really fun my little brother loves it and is always asking if he can play it I like it too
A10TZX7XSVXB11 B005RXEXP8 4 1371081600 22 Easy to follow.  Good game to pass idle time with.  I enjoy playing solitaire and this version works to pass the time.
A10TZX7XSVXB11 B006J2EG6M 4 1381708800 20 It's very challenging and fun.  It's similar to Scrabble.  It's my favorite app at this time.  Would highly recommend it.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00A4EZ3QS 4 1368835200 20 I see everyone playing this game and having fun. So I decided to try and and I really like it.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00IKZX1ZI 5 1402358400 23 I bought this game because I like challenges. Its keeps me occupied.  I bought it because of the movie, which was also good.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B008LXN9II 3 1386547200 31 Not very good game.  Bad choice on purchasing it.  Just like the Hidden Object games. I play it every once in a while to see if I still don't like it.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B0088Y7YHW 4 1366761600 23 I like this game, but not very lucky in it.  It is one of the many games I have on my Kindle Fire3.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00BGDEK9C 5 1366761600 20 Bowling is lots of fun.  I am still learning on how to throw the ball.  Just like in real bowing.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00CDV6WDS 5 1369958400 28 I love All-in-One Mahjong. Its so great and not boring at all. I tried two others and finished them in no time.  This one is not so easy..
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00A757EFW 1 1386547200 26 Boring.  I use to like it, but I guess I lost interest in it.  It is not easy for me to play it on my Kindle.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00FI1759K 1 1393027200 21 its ok.  It wasn't what I expected, so I don't enjoy playing it.  Its just not a fun game for me.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B004HE5TAG 4 1366761600 23 I like playing Blackjack 21.  I may learn how to master it someday soon.  Its a challenge to try and beat the dealer.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00DJ075FQ 3 1398643200 25 The games is  okay. Not what I anticipated. I played it for a while, but its definitely not my favorite. Had to re-shuffle too much.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B004LZIZHU 4 1368835200 32 I enjoy playing this game very much.  I play this and watch TV at the same time.  It makes you want to play it , just so you can improve your score.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00975HIYU 3 1386547200 33 You lose more than you win.  Don't get me wrong, I love playing the slots, but after awhile it gets boring, expecially when you lose.  I go back every once in a while.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B00A11AN6O 5 1381536000 35 I just love this item.  I now can view my favorite photos on my Kindle.  It is the greatest thing ever.  Everyone should do this.  I show everyone my favorite photos where ever I go.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B008JJS6D2 4 1366761600 24 I like this game because you are able to play 4 cards at a time, but usually I just play 2 cards, sometimes 3.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B008R9OIUO 3 1386547200 27 I like the game, but when you finish all the challenges, its not fun to play it over.  I will probably go back to it after awhile.
A10U3DUTCLWF06 B006QMYF0W 5 1366761600 25 I enjoy playing Solitare. I take my Kindle Fire3 along with me when I have a Doctors Appt. or just getting a bite to eat.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B00B7KKNI6 5 1366848000 22 This game is a real adrenaline rush, I play against my sister throughout the day.  I would recommend this game to everyone.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B004JJXVYK 5 1364083200 28 I like it as a brain power builder and the fact that I don't need a wireless connection to play it, which makes it great on long trips.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B0087SGWI6 5 1366848000 27 I haven't tried all the games in this app yet but so far I am enjoying it, especially since so far I have been graded above average.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B007XKEZ7O 5 1365465600 32 This is just a lot of fun, I have met someone new with this game, I like the fact you can send a personal message with your picture to the other player.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B007XKEY6Q 5 1359763200 21 My sister has been bugging me to get this game, and I'm glad she did, love playing it on my Kindle.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B0094BB4TW 5 1359763200 20 I would recommend it to everyone.  I have facebook on my PC but wanted it on my kindle fire HD.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B005ZXWMUS 5 1359763200 21 I have Netflix on my PC and wanted it on my Kindle Fire HD, and you gotta love the price, FREE.
A10U5WLCGVHY77 B008YSWKLW 5 1366848000 27 I'm really good at the 4 and 5 word jumbles but then it starts getting a little tougher, I have had to pull out a world map.
A10UARJYM5FY86 B00E78QIDE 4 1377734400 33 Great little game highly recommend to anyone. Not that many ads surprisingly. Only complaint I have is I don't really care for the sounds, but it's a simple fix. Turn the volume down.
A10UB2XDGIE2OG B006ON41FC 3 1329436800 20 the game itself is sparse but fine. the big problem is it crashes frequently and pushes hard to rate it.
A10UB2XDGIE2OG B006RA13BW 1 1333411200 32 this is just clip art balloons behind a clip art sky background. If your kids are entertained by this just have them look at clouds or better yet buy them actual balloons.
A10UB2XDGIE2OG B0064ETS1I 5 1330473600 25 This game is a lot of fun and requires some pretty thorough micro managing. It a lot like a tycoon game crossed with airport mania.
A10UB2XDGIE2OG B004HXHVZ8 5 1327104000 22 This does everything you could dream of in terms of telling you when movies play. I wish it told ticket price though.
A10UB2XDGIE2OG B007NACZPI 3 1332460800 28 tiny village is like every other social media game, micro trans actions and all. On the plus side the art is lovely and it works without any hitches.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B0084HDG8Y 3 1364947200 23 This was fun for a bit. But you have to buy the full version to really get any use out of the game.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B0073U6WLG 3 1364947200 20 The game was okay and fun at first. But then it became boring very quickly. It's okay to kill time.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B0087SGWI6 3 1364947200 22 The game was fun, I kept it for awhile until I burned it out. Definitely worth getting and playing for a bit.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B008JK6W5K 5 1355875200 29 This app is challenging and so enjoyable. Anyone who enjoys a good brain teaser needs this app. I play it everyday to decompress from a long day at work.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B005HSL626 4 1364947200 22 Fruit Ninja is such a great time killer. Waiting for the train or an appointment, either way it will keep you occupied.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B00599ZRSC 1 1364947200 22 This game was not fun at all. It just was not interesting and boring. The story line was not engaging at all.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B008L3T37O 2 1364947200 21 This game is to easy. The objects were not concealed very well and the scenes were repetitive and not designed well.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B007TXN4TK 5 1364947200 20 I really like this app. It's fun to try and play these songs. It's challenging and really fun to play.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B00A757EFW 3 1364947200 26 This game was a blast from the past! But it would only allow you to play 2 screens before you had to buy the entire game.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B009UWL580 1 1364947200 22 This game was not fun and it was really difficult to judge where the claw was going to land. Mostly for kids.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B009SDHIPK 1 1364947200 22 This game was much to complicated to play. There was just so many things to remember and combinations to compile. Not fun.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B007CK1MEY 3 1364947200 22 This game was fun for a bit. The backgrounds were cool, but you had to purchase the game for any real content.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B009O2XY12 4 1364947200 23 It was fun for awhile. But then it just became repetitive. But it was good for awhile and I'd load it it again.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B004K4RY9M 2 1364947200 20 This game was boring. I blew through it in less then 1.5hrs. Then the game was over. What a bummer.
A10UBMAGBY2IZC B007XMV9XK 4 1364947200 22 It's fun to just hang out and play with it. Keeps me engaged, it's mostly math but fun it is fun anyway.
A10UD0MJALAMFH B00E3WJRIM 5 1377475200 26 This game is great fun and is very addicting. I highly recommend it to one and all. I play with a ton of my facenook friends.
A10UD0MJALAMFH B004SIIBGU 5 1363305600 21 This is a great app for those of us that selling ebay! I love hearing the chaching when I sell something.
A10UD0MJALAMFH B009G9KFQ0 5 1363996800 21 I love weatherbug so far! My husband always wants to know what the weather is and now its right at hand!
A10UD9T4JWFF1R B008Y2FRFO 5 1350000000 25 I love game i play it all the time on my kindle.Love to play on my i phone and my i pad and i pod
A10UD9T4JWFF1R B009HKL4B8 5 1359849600 25 i leave this gane 5 stars because i love it very much the only thing i don't like is that ut need wifi to play
A10UDAKD2IQA49 B007PT3QOQ 5 1334016000 23 This is a fun game! I have played it on facebook &amp; back in the day on the computer--just like I remember it.
A10UDAKD2IQA49 B008CFVG58 5 1342396800 45 Very fun and addictive game!!! I got this as a free app but would have paid for it. Make sure you do the VIP days as they are worth a lot of money and hold on to your Garfield pts to save up for helpers.
A10UDRINJXKLOY B008IXP8IU 5 1370736000 23 Really challenge and a lot harder then it seem at the outset but once u het started it's really hard yo put down
A10UDRINJXKLOY B00D1A1F50 5 1376697600 20 Really nerve racking but if u like riddles then this game is a must not for kids tho.should get it.
A10UDRINJXKLOY B00DJFIMW6 5 1373328000 31 Nice with graphics I initially just downloaded to see what it was like but I think I'll keep and I don't think my grandson is going to let me remove it.
A10UDRINJXKLOY B00CAW96DI 5 1371254400 36 I have five or six games like this and this may be one of the most challenging. It goes from hard to easy to medium which keeps me not only occupied but keeps my mind working.
A10UDRINJXKLOY B00COVCV50 5 1371081600 36 I have quite a few word games and I thought this would be pretty much the s ama me however this keeps me on Wynn toes because it goes from easy to hard and back again
A10UDRINJXKLOY B00AEJPK0C 5 1373328000 20 Can't stop playing. I've actually taken it off but I put it back on immediately. Obviously I'm playing it now.
A10UDRINJXKLOY B00975HIYU 5 1368921600 22 I have been actually intending not to even try this game but now that I've started playing I actually am enjoying it
A10UH6W34CAW0N B008AZGWYK 5 1380067200 23 I love this app. I love the body feature. You can touch an area and it will give possible diagnosis. It is great.
A10UH6W34CAW0N B00A7HP4C0 4 1380067200 35 This app is fun. It can be irritating but it is fun. I deleted it b/c I got tired of it. But kids will probably really enjoy it. It was fun while I had it.
A10UH6W34CAW0N B006RXD2I6 5 1381536000 27 Very very fun. There are so many choices it never gets old. Definitely addictive.  More than worth the download. I have it downloaded on all my devices.
A10UH6W34CAW0N B006KX3GXO 4 1380067200 47 This app is great. It gives more than most free downloads. I have not installed the updates however b/c the permissions make me nervous. It requests to take pictures from your phone which I don't understand at all. But it is fun. You can create a lot!
A10UH6W34CAW0N B00BGAZYLI 2 1380067200 61 This app just doesn't have anything to it. It costs too much to blow up on letter, it costs to much to reveal a letter. It doesn't give you hints. The worst part about it is that it will give about ten easy puzzles and then hit you with one that doesn't make any sense. It just isn't worth the space.
A10UHQH1YL5Q6B B00CJ95O2E 2 1405296000 18 I did not like it, I did not see any difference and I tested for over a week..
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B006R8GK2Q 4 1328400000 23 fun for whole family and tells a good story too.  seek n find gamego be done run to her at my me out
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00D0VZLVE 5 1371427200 25 I enjoy it and I like it and I think its fun and I like word games and its free I suggest to get it.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B008N04TMO 4 1365811200 23 Definitely better than the first game. I like the way you can earn money to buy help. This game is Lots of fun.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00C5HW022 5 1370304000 24 This game is so long! I play alot of these types of games and this is definitely one of the best. Great job Alawar!
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00CWG9EUM 5 1380240000 34 I love the Dexter quality of creepy serial killing. the game has a few really hard puzzles, but all are passable. excellent mix of problem solving, hidden object, and mysterious killings....ha ha love it.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B0091REZMW 5 1364515200 31 it is a good game with lots of friendly players who are always willing to help out. gotta give five stars for the bonus. worth it! it really is fun though.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00ADIT8U2 4 1361664000 24 Graphics are good. Puzzles are a little to easy. The game needs to be five times longer, but excellent for free. I had fun.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00C7TAF3Y 5 1370476800 34 Great game....when will I get the next Room? It took me about 3 hours total, I think, I got lost in the fun! I'll be watching for the next one. Well worth the $2.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B007VUA7VO 5 1365465600 40 this app is a great help. it is nice to know voltage and temperature during charging while using the kindle. the alarms are nice too.  it is always better to spend the battery ALMOST all the way down before charging.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00CAW96DI 5 1371427200 26 this game is awesome you should really get it I love this game. I have played this game for five minutes and I already love it.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00JE7XQI8 4 1400198400 25 I think this Is a pretty decent game it is entertaining but I always need more coins but it is addicting and fun get it.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00B0419YG 5 1362614400 28 Good game the only thing I can think of to improve the game would be to have more problem solving than just seek and find... I liked it.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B007U7BIO8 2 1395878400 30 I set this alarm to wake me up for school at 6:15-ish. but it occasionally dissent wake me up till 6:50. I would recon.end a different alarm app for sure.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00CF34B2I 5 1400457600 33 First time I have tried a card fighting games. Surprisingly fun and the kindle makes it easy to learn with all the help tabs. I will definitely recommend it to my friends. DaddieO
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B008Y7SMQU 5 1349827200 22 it is a lot harder than it looks but it is still fun.some of these logos I have not even herd of
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00AIQP9DE 5 1365292800 49 wow! great grafics, good play time, excellent games. G5 has a lot of good games and this one doesn't dissapoint. love the sales... I bought all seven for a buck each! only one so far that was just too easy, but still loads of fun. keep it up G5!
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B0080K98U0 5 1338076800 24 kinda like the original Zelda for the nintendo.  huge with llots to do.  you have to spend real money to get a full experience.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B0074AKEDC 4 1339459200 20 a be nice fun do run go at on to so be beg bed ben Bel bey both no mom
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00F24OV8G 5 1384041600 35 I absolutely love this app. I am only on level four right now and I need the extra coins.  but I abdolutly regiment that you get this app I love it........and so does my sister.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B004VMUS9G 5 1342137600 56 Great app... love the random music and all the customizable options.  Just need to be able to put in a specific date so I can use it to remind me of Dr. Appts.  I use on my kindle fire with no problems at all..everything works great except for stuff you need a phone for...gps & etc.
A10UJQKQM6P9NT B00E4PSG7G 5 1376524800 38 I absolutely love this game. if you put music in the bacround then silence the rest of the sounds in the game this game will be even better then before. me and My sister both love this game.
A10UKKOC6Z7X6X B00AEJPK0C 2 1372982400 20 Very difficult to complete. Instructions not clear.  Does not seem to work as it should. I would not recommend it.
A10UKKOC6Z7X6X B00CJ77HU8 5 1372204800 24 computer doesn't follow the rules Colors and shapes with every move. no indication of amount. of time allowed.  but very chlallenging and time consuming.
A10UKXKHNNJN26 B00CMMR9SU 4 1395273600 24 a fun game. it relaxing fun game. i like to unwind at night before going to sleep and playing games like this really help.
A10UKXKHNNJN26 B00DJK2TO8 4 1393113600 29 i like playing music games but this one is quite hard. i have been stuck on the same song for a few weeks now and can't get passed it.
A10UKXKHNNJN26 B008GU42KK 4 1393113600 35 i like this game and paid for it so i could go further. I wish that it just didn't have the same locations that you play over and over again. gets boring.need to expand it.
A10UKXKHNNJN26 B009HUB40Y 3 1393113600 20 i love to play puzzle games and stimulate my brain. Very high paced game.Always like trying new games and puzzles
A10UKXKHNNJN26 B00DUF0MOQ 2 1393113600 22 Always a good filler game to play when bored.I like to play at night before going to bed.Get that from my Dad
A10UKXKHNNJN26 B0094BB4TW 3 1395964800 30 i didn't realize i already had it installed. So i didn't need it. Good app just can't play the games in there like you can on your computer or phone.
A10ULI2QPY7YW8 B007MTQ8C6 3 1363392000 22 alot of us see how can do the best on this game . it,s a hard game to play at times .
A10ULI2QPY7YW8 B004K4RY9M 5 1367280000 25 I will be in and out for now but it helps put me to sleep at night.put I can get to play it more .
A10UPEYP39IQUL B007PW1BZY 4 1356480000 47 I played this game recently at a friends house . I was pleased to find it on my apps. The play was as good as having people across the table from me. It was definitely worth the buck it cost me. It's one of my favorite apps.
A10UPEYP39IQUL B008Y2FRFO 1 1358035200 48 This game was supposed to be free but it constantly runs out of coins and then requires you to wait 30 seconds before it gives you one lousy coin. Says it's free but if you want more coins you have to pay for them. FREE MEANS FREE. RIPOFF!
A10UPEYP39IQUL B006OBWGHO 5 1357430400 27 I wish there were more levels but still a fun game . Kept my attention. Good puzzle game. Some of the levels were actually a little hard.
A10UPEYP39IQUL B007VUA7VO 5 1374624000 35 This battery app works great. Gives me up to date easy to read battery information. I love how the battery bubbles too . Kinda cool. Tells me everything I need to know in a glimps.
A10UPN5NNTE9QN B006VW94HQ 5 1343174400 23 Makes you think! But it's British not just American English, so it helps if you know what a lorrie and a flat are.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B007HIM53I 5 1335312000 29 Fun game, really cute and it's fun to decorate your club and choose drinks to make. I love trying out different setups to see what looks and works beer.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00FEMJF6O 5 1397347200 22 Having a blast on the Kindle Fire HD. Building my town, sending my heroes out to explore, etc . It's a blast.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B0067QCC70 5 1342828800 30 I love the hidden object games and this one is really good. It isn't too easy or too complicared. The story is a great twist unlike most hidden object games.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00846FBEM 4 1346457600 33 I really enjoyed this hidden object game. Not too bad on a screen like the Kindle Fire. The puzzles were enough to make you think but not so hard that they were frustrating.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00AMEFZ72 5 1383955200 36 Very fun, but fast and really keeps you on your toes. The more cards you play the faster you have to flip them around and it can get a bit crazy. Overall a great game, though!
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00CBT4F3G 1 1368403200 53 This is an awesome game on Pc but the app does not work on kindle fire. Nothing says any specific version of the kindle is required and contacting the company has been a complete waste of time. This was the biggest waste of money so far on anything I've purchased for my kindle.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00C7TAF3Y 5 1384992000 27 The graphics are beautiful, the puzzles make you think, but you can figure them out. I love the music, and the entire game. Well worth the money!
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00JVZ0DQG 5 1403568000 46 This is a really fun app for the Kindle HD.  I start playing and don't know where all the time goes. It's really easy to get lost in it. I really recommend the game since it is so much fun and easy to get lost in.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00BFUUMO8 5 1383955200 29 This is such a d fun game, I haven't found any glitches or problems. The graphics are great and I really have a lot of fun playing the game.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B008S3EJSU 5 1382572800 38 I've played a lot of games, and this is my favorite by far. It's nice to play a real game, not just a small mobile game. It's funny, well-made, and overall a great time. Totally worth the money.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00CH87HF4 5 1381449600 29 I'm really impressed to find a game like this for Kindle. I love the fact that it was free but hate in-game purchases for the better equipment, potions, etc.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00AF09O2A 4 1390780800 23 Great game. If I was more of a Keno fan , I'm give it 5 stars. It's just a little slow for me.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B007NACZPI 5 1332547200 20 So far this has been a lot of fun, not too complicated, and I would recommend it to my friends.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B004O9G750 5 1328486400 27 Works great on my Kindle Fire. I've had a lot of fun with it and haven't had a single problem or complaint. Easy to learn and play.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00HFTHXMC 5 1397347200 35 This is is a really fun game that stands out from other games similar to it it. I like the story, the way it works and the fact that it's just a lot of fun.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00AVGGYNA 5 1390608000 39 I've tried other bingo games and was always disappointed. This one doesn't disappoint. It's a lot of fun, the speed. Is perfect,  The bonus games are a lot of fun and add a whole new element to the game.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00AESN8XY 5 1383868800 31 Hard to put it down. It's great working out how to infect the population, when to make fatalities and try to keep a cure from beginning by invented. Lots of fun!
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00EW0XSP8 5 1397088000 45 I've got other games that are similar to this but this one is more laid back and a lot of fun. As you add more things to your shop it will get busier but it will still be a lot of fun. I recommend it!
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B0067Q4PQQ 5 1330819200 56 It's great game that steadily works you into bigger, better orders and really keeps the pace moving. It's neverbboring and it's great for hand eye coordination as well as memory and observation skills. I was so impressed that I decided to buy the paid game for more to do and to make it even more challenging.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00CTQ6SIG 5 1398384000 32 Love the game, and I'm even willing to spend money on it. I haven't needed to spend actual money which is great. It's true to the show and enjoyable on its own.
A10UU7QN4WSFYL B00876UUN6 5 1400284800 35 Very addictive. A friend of mine talked me into trying it and now I can't put it down. Capturing Moga' s turned out to be a lot of fun and it even has a story.
A10UVHE753SVH9 B007RHJWT4 3 1368144000 22 my husband downloaded it for me to my kindle.  he thought I'd enjoy it.  it's a bit addicting, but after awhile... meh.
A10UVHE753SVH9 B005ZXWMUS 4 1368144000 68 Only bc I have to wait so long for the movies I want to see and also bc there are a lot of movies I want to see that they do not offer.  However, that being said, thank god for Netflix, really.  I am a movie buff on a shoestring budget and Netflix allows me to pick and choose more intelligently how I spend my movie going capital.
A10UVHE753SVH9 B00BJ9VBLI 3 1394496000 22 good for distraction. nice graphics, which kept me occupied for a fair amount of time. not bad for the price I guess.
A10UVNJ49TENUA B00ED4TX2A 5 1383004800 41 Cool game. Sucks you have to either wait to play once your energy's gone or pay but I guess they gotta make money somehow. Plus it doesn't show you to sit around all day playing which is exactly what I'd do
A10UVNJ49TENUA B00CTQ6SIG 5 1374192000 22 Best city building game I've played. Fun and I like the simpsons theme. A bit slow at first but it does up
A10V7J0K4N862E B006OCM13M 5 1342483200 29 I love this game so much it is awesome. please add camostinker1.  I am in need of friends. if u get this game u will love it. I did.

A10V7J0K4N862E B005VTS4EY 4 1331510400 31 This game was so fun. I had played the game red remover online and this game is so much fun. It gradually gets harder and harder, but it is so fun.

A10VFB924QEP34 B008AZGWYK 4 1390867200 38 I tried a different app to find out I had to know what was wrong with me and then read up on it. This allows you  to put in the issues and see possible conditions. I like it.
A10VFB924QEP34 B008XG1X18 5 1372723200 22 I like the ease of use on this version. It's fun when playing on the kindle.I will be using this a lot.
A10VFB924QEP34 B006P2Y2QK 4 1397347200 25 it is good until it freezes up or won't move the cards for me. it works more than not so I gave the 4 stars.
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B00A4KVFLY 5 1357084800 31 This game is definitely worth playing! Just started yesterday and I'm already a level 5 player!! Some of the questions and answers are kinda rigged but over all I like it
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B00AK2RHR2 5 1358640000 33 I hated that the free demo ended on this game cause I really wanted to keep going I enjoy any type of game that deals with time management! Especially on my off days!
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B009HKL4B8 5 1357516800 26 I've only been playing for 2 days and I've completely fallen in love with this game! I've never enjoyed playing a game this much I'm addicted!
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B00DBCJLOA 5 1378339200 21 I love the games and slots great job keep up the good work maybe you could give me more coins please
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B00AJ1S1CY 2 1358640000 31 I wish it was more to this game instead of finding the elves in a Christmas tree...and you don't even find them you just click on them like &#34;whack a mole&#34;
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B009WYCDZU 1 1357862400 34 If I truly wanted this game I would buy and download it. I don't want this garbage I just want to play my Sims game...get rid of this stupid ad please!!!! I hate it!
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B004SOR4H6 5 1358640000 20 The twitter app is great when I'm on the go and I can keep up with my tweets and followers
A10VGL7SZI2Y7C B00AAIHGA4 3 1358640000 20 For a Kindle Sonic game it was great...but I personally wouldn't have paid for it if it wasn't for free...
A10VI2H8MCSS4B B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366070400 32 I love it. My only wish...more. I'm a huge movie nerd and blew through the levels in one night. Though from the looks of things updates of new levels are made often.
A10VI2H8MCSS4B B0073U6WLG 5 1332979200 36 Five min of play and I already love this game. I love the speed of the game, so glad it has a little challenge to it. Great work, dev! Sharing this with my brother and husband.
A10VI2H8MCSS4B B004O9G750 1 1326240000 23 The resolution is extremely grainy, the shooter lags and the game is super slow. Not compatible at all with the Kindle Fire. uninstall.
A10VI2H8MCSS4B B004H6WTJI 5 1326240000 31 I'm a true MFP junkie. t's great to be able to take the site with me and log foods I eat on the go. So glad it's compatible with the Fire.
A10VI6VTT8I1CX B00HBVON72 5 1388620800 29 Nice game to relax to after a day at work. I like that there is a challenge but doesn't completely stump you so that you tire of the game.
A10VI6VTT8I1CX B00DLJ31HQ 5 1374451200 21 Love sitting down after a long day and being able to relax with this great brain teaser, keeps the brain working!
A10VKCEXFKG5BW B0070O973K 1 1330214400 31 the title waifs it all, a 8 year old kid probely made this game, unbelievable. Also how could the mora if the app store even ALLOW this on here?? stupid app!!
A10VKCEXFKG5BW B004SJ3AXI 5 1324339200 23 I love this app, I really love Angry Birds and I'm not going to lie, this one is my favorite Angry Birds app.
A10VKCEXFKG5BW B0071Q75AO 5 1330214400 71 the title saids it all, HORRIBLE seriously, how dumb would people be? THIS WORKS, HORRAY! IT SAID IM HAPPY. and then the next time you do it.. THIS DOESNT WORK, IT SAIDS IM AFRAID BUT IM MAD, GAAAAA, DELETE THIS FROM THE APP STORE!! 5 stars so people could read this without going to the end. but this thing is horrible. Whoever made this was prob a 10 year old kid!
A10VKCEXFKG5BW B005UQ9FNC 5 1326067200 21 This game is so fun, I have sooooo much fun playing it and I love the baby birds,  their so cute!
A10VPXCQL92K1H B00FJWGHZG 5 1392249600 23 Just downloaded this app to give it a quick try, played for 3 hours without stopping! This game is like a drug, ADDICTIVE
A10VPXCQL92K1H B00FX6ZBXC 5 1391299200 38 Word chums is not your every day run of the mill word game! I love that you can customize the avatars. The fact that you can play against the computer as well as your friends is awesome! Addictive
A10VPXCQL92K1H B00DHKKN6Q 5 1386547200 20 This game is just down right fun! Hours of great fun, sometimes it's just hard to put down. Love it!!!!
A10VPXCQL92K1H B009OYODAG 4 1382140800 21 Great game for passing the time away.  I love the original restaurant story. This holiday themed one is excellent as well
A10VPXCQL92K1H B00BHHIWQO 4 1381622400 20 Great app, very addictive.  Will keep u busy for hours!  Great family fun. Would definitely recommend this app to others
A10VR39YMLWVKH B00FX6ZBXC 5 1384387200 29 I like this app because it lets you expand your intention spend by playing and having fun with your friends. I like playing with friends because I love competing.
A10VR39YMLWVKH B00CEBO09A 4 1371254400 32 I love yours have it reminds me of this other hand u can get on here for free it's called Lep World and they have a Lep World 2 it's really fun.
A10VR39YMLWVKH B00CMMR9SU 5 1369958400 25 This game is really good, great, awesome, amazing, fun because you have to figure out a strategy for the rest of the game do .
A10VSAHXL0DBXW B004R13U6Y 5 1325030400 54 it is good to see a quality app work on the kindle. this I find is great for reading PDF files.It has a nice set of features. Well made and puts most other apps far behind in terms of build quailty, features and appearance.Wish we had an equivalent Office app as good as this.
A10VW3S5CZZ4SZ B00FGFVMGA 3 1386201600 20 Great fun  game,  but makes you really think a little...easy to play and is very suitable for the kindle fire.
A10VW3S5CZZ4SZ B008Y212PI 5 1380585600 20 this is a very fun game with pretty pictures. many hours of play.tell your friends to get this game please
A10VW3S5CZZ4SZ B00EBCO798 5 1377302400 20 We've had so much fun with this app.  Just hard enough to make you think. Great t share with friends.
A10VX1PY3TROIM B007ZGO7EM 5 1404086400 34 works well and it's quite handy when you need it. The calculator has many options for all your needs. Having it on my kindle makes it great if I don't have my phone handy.
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B00AA87JGU 4 1372982400 26 Not bad. I could not put it down. Be careful since it is addicted. There is only one drawback: you need to buy some hidden stages.
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B00B2V66VS 1 1369785600 101 This is a nice game until it crahsed on my kindle fire. I have the first generation Kindle Fire BTW. It is very dissapointed for so many fans who actually love this game and still waiting in helpless situation. I am very suprised to find out there are so many people complaint about it and Amazon still hasn't done anything to fix this problem. A good company, a very good device and a very polular game can not work together and come up with a solution after such a long time dispite so many complaints from customers. What can I say?
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B00E7SFAAG 4 1384387200 79 Over all, it is a nice game. Really fun and cute concept, Great replay value, lovely recorded scene from you previous playing for reviewing your own performance. Our whole family enjoys this little game. The only reason I wihtdraw one star is there should be a tutorial for how to control the button for run and jump.  Yes you can eventually figuire out how to play by your own if you keep trying but it could be very frustrated.
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B00CWY76CC 5 1372896000 22 Our whole family enjoyed this game. Well organized and sophisticated puzzles. For those who love to solve puzzles, you will be amazed.
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B00EGY1WN0 5 1397520000 24 You can build an electric book library with this app! One of my favorite features is I can select the categories of the books.
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B00FAPF5U0 3 1384819200 303 This game does have lovely colorful cute graphics, euhoinious music and really sweet and playful concept as a puzzle game. But (ah yes , I hate this &#34;but&#34;) here comes the bitter part, if you don't want to spend some money to do some in game purchase, things will get ugly in several ways. First, at level 35, you need to finish three extra puzzles to unlock the next chapter. To make this worse, after you finished one puzzle, you will have to wait 24 hours then the next puzzle will come to available. Second, even you are patient enough to invest some time, here is another tricky part, the candies might be changed and relocated by the program during the game! Whenever the program claims &#34;there is no more possible move&#34;, all your puzzles (or your candies) will immidiately be replaced or relocated by the game AKA your opponent at its own convenience. So think about that, you already figure out your strategy to clear all the puzzles then after you already use up some of your moves, kaboom! Everything changes and you have either spend some money for some &#34;booster&#34; or buy yourself some more &#34; moves&#34; to finish the game or else. And the game will continue to give you some useless candy to guarantee your faliar until you spend hours after hours for one single chapter. Eventually you have reach the threshold of time accumulation  in that one single chapter, they will let you pass. Since I did experience some of the senarios the computer suddenly keeped sending me very useful candies to solve my puzzle like too good to be true.Honestly, I would rather spend some$$$ to buy a fair play game at the very beginning. This &#34; free then force you to pay&#34; is so called &#34;blackmail&#34;.
A10VXRCL5PVH9U B0062P7SSY 5 1323648000 154 Normally I don't play games much. But this one brings me so much fun. Very cute and vivid graphics, interstting music and so much more to talk about. I got it on amazon at a ten cent deal. But I think it worth much more than the 2.99 regular price. Go get this game and you will love it.updateSee what's new on android market for this game, absulutely bad news for amazon users.Sorry, no Christmas for Jelly defense here!1. Two winter levels for Christmas evenings.2. Challenging endless level.3. New and cozy Christmas tune.4. Increasing the difficulty after finishing the game isn't mandatory anymore. You can now go back to previous levels.5. Minor performance improvements.6. Minor gameplay adjustments.7. Reindeers & cookies! :-)update:finally, at Jan 20 afternoon, I got my update.But hey, who would love to celebrate their Chirstmas at Jan? At the time when Christmas trees at the recycle bin? Amazon, what can I say?
A10W364GWEDOR B00808GTI6 5 1393372800 23 I'm having a good time watching what I want when I want. Its a good app.A hiccup now and then but otherwise great.
A10W364GWEDOR B00EXVZW6E 4 1393372800 20 This game has so many different quests that you can go on and on. I spent hours doing them .
A10W364GWEDOR B00FAPF5U0 3 1393372800 21 The game is great but I'm not fond of in app purchasing. Other than that it is very addictive. Try it.
A10W364GWEDOR B00CWY76CC 5 1390608000 23 Really enjoyed the challenges but wished it kept going. I was disappointed that it ended and have to wait for more to come.
A10W364GWEDOR B00ENTEP32 2 1393372800 41 Fun game but I didn't pay attention to the fact it has in app purchasing which I'm not fond of. I have used Big Fish games for years and never had to purchase to continue, so that's a bummer for me.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B00766HXAQ 4 1336089600 21 Great game to play when needed to pass the time. Also great to play with another player over lunch or break.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B004GYY714 5 1351728000 81 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS APP!! I can tune in to any radio station in the country no matter where I am. Worked great on a long road trip when my car radio couldn't pick up a station, just tuned in to TUNEIN and found several stations to listen too while I was driving. Told my family to get this app for there android devices & they all love it also. Works great in airports, on airplanes, trains & in their bathrooms.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B007SYDYLS 4 1345852800 40 This is a fun word association game to play! It really requires you to think about putting the right words on top of each other. I like it when you make a correct match and gives you a perfect score.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B008JGSM6G 5 1343174400 67 REALLY LOVE THIS GAME! Thought it was going to be a simple connect the dots type of game, but it's not. Starts off simple, then becomes more challenging to play. Makes you think through each step to connect the pipes and not leave any void spaces. Really like how it adds another color pipe as you progress from level to level. VERY ADDICTIVE AND QUITE ENJOYABLE GAME!!
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B006RXD2I6 5 1343174400 39 Great set of solitaire games to play. Love the different versions of the games. Really liked having the games give you a demo of how to play each game. Wonderful set of card games for one person to enjoy.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B0064X7B4A 5 1336953600 21 This is a really GREAT GAME! Love being able to play against other people anytime, anywhere I want in my house.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B00CRLSN4U 4 1382745600 21 Good game to play alone or with others. Only needs to have more coins awarded for guessing right the first time.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B008JJS6D2 3 1346630400 44 This is a fun game to play. It does still have a few glitches like taking a minute load and sometimes the numbers don't check off after you've touched them. Also playing with more than 2 cards is hard to see on the kindle.
A10W3NB9ISPTCG B004H6WTJI 5 1351728000 68 This program is very easy to use for the beginner & advanced dieter, or for anyone that just want to watch what they eat. I've really enjoyed using this program. It has helped me loose weight since I started keeping track of what I eat & my exercises. It even lets me track other body measurements. It also reminds me if I haven't recorded anything for that day.
A10W3XITNDFE2O B00AEL7M7E 4 1373846400 46 This is a version of the match 3 or more items type computer games. I am enjoying this game and the references to the story of &#34;Around the World in 80 Days&#34;. If you liike the match games I think you will also enjoy this game.
A10W3XITNDFE2O B00B2W289G 5 1364860800 33 Hope you are enjoying this game as much as I am. I play it quite frequently. I strongly urge everyone to try it, I'm sure it will hook you as it did me.
A10W3XITNDFE2O B00APKROYK 5 1364860800 69 I've been trying for several weeks now and only rarely do I actually beat the computer. I have the most success against the game Hangman. I am really terrible against the word jumbles, I hold out hope that playing this game which is really good and challenging often will help me improve my word skills. Go for it!  See if you can beat the computer - I challenge you.
A10W6FHXD1Z63Q B0054JZC6E 4 1326844800 20 This game is kind of addicting! It is very fun yet somewhat hard. It makes you really use your brain.
A10W6FHXD1Z63Q B0086700CM 5 1338595200 87 I freakin love this game! So happy it is finally on kindle fire! Oh ya I have one more thing to say, all of you people out there that rated this game low because it wouldn't download or it restarted your device, get the frick over it. You are sopposed to rate this game on the actual game you morons! So don't blame Imangi Studios, blame your freakin device! Godness but any ways this is a great game and I would totally recomemd it on kindle fire!:)-
A10W6FHXD1Z63Q B006N1K1AE 2 1334016000 27 It is weird how it appears on the other side. I don't really like it personally but you might so go ahead and try it. Beats me!;)
A10W6FHXD1Z63Q B00529IOXO 3 1347753600 26 it doesn't work the best I mean it is very slow and wont send pics at least that is how mine is on the kindle fire
A10W8IZ9N6BSQ0 B00BJ9VBLI 1 1389398400 21 Just similar to too many games and not that enjoyable to play.  Did not make a lot of sense to me.
A10W8IZ9N6BSQ0 B0094BB4TW 5 1389398400 44 An excellent way to stay in touch with friends and family.  I have found people I haven't gotten to see in years or since high school.  I love being able to have pages that connect me to my love of God and Hebraic roots.
A10W8IZ9N6BSQ0 B004HE5TAG 2 1389398400 21 I love to play blackjack but after a while it just gets boring.  Just not one of the more challenging games.
A10W8IZ9N6BSQ0 B00BHHIWQO 2 1389398400 27 Boring.  Its just like other games but just not as satisfying as the other games.  Would not recommend this games if you enjoyed the more popular games.
A10W8IZ9N6BSQ0 B00FAPF5U0 5 1389398400 22 Addictive, frustrating but so much fun.  A lot of my facebook friends play this game and we swap lives and other options
A10W95A23NOPMD B0060BE8I8 5 1326499200 33 this game is so fun the paper asks you puestions and you get a choice and when it comes to getting a mate don't pick the green dragon you will never get her.
A10W95A23NOPMD B005LIYX5Y 5 1326499200 43 you have got to get this it seems boring at first but when you get to level four everything gets really good. to get there gas t just race until you upgrade a level then get enough cash to by the level car.
A10W95A23NOPMD B006CZ4238 2 1326499200 35 It is not that good of graphics but it is a game that you could get used to but this is definetley not worth money if you don't like not to just throw the ball.
A10W95A23NOPMD B005HSL626 5 1326499200 36 this is the best free app there is on the kindle fire. You have to get this you will have so much fun that it will seem a couple minutes passed but really a couple hours.
A10W95A23NOPMD B0054JZC6E 3 1326499200 30 this is a game if you are board and want to waste some time but it gets kind of boring after a couple of tries to beat a mini game.
A10W95A23NOPMD B0051W73RA 3 1326499200 35 this is a good game it is just hard on the level with a wild boar but it definatley is a fun game so listen to me and get this game you will love it
A10WBAGF53RR09 B008KO4DT2 5 1353456000 25 want to keep playing this wonder full game never want to put it down the pitcures on the cups are halirous it makes me laugh
A10WBAGF53RR09 B00FYEPQWO 5 1386288000 22 this game is so fun people who say its not is crazy I just loving shooting the guns it is so fun
A10WBAGF53RR09 B006OC2ANS 1 1336867200 21 this game kept crashing my kindle after playing for 5 minutes this game works great on android but horrible on fire
A10WBAGF53RR09 B00D5O7BPU 5 1389052800 28 It is great but I already own the Carbine it is a good game it is cool all the guns I have ever wanted to shoot from Wwii
A10WBAGF53RR09 B00AZL3PBK 1 1363478400 24 it sucks because it always like just freezes on I hats this dumb dumb game it is so useless and boring bring on mairo
A10WBAGF53RR09 B00AAIHGA4 1 1355875200 25 I wish my grandma never hooked me on this game ir never works and it wont let you do any thing boring boring it sucks

A10WBAGF53RR09 B009LTL906 1 1365811200 21 It makes me pay my own money so I can get bigwin cards what ever you do don't buy this game
A10WGZ5Q514NYN B00ATDOVNK 3 1358985600 75 As with most of G5s find an object games, the graphics and story behind the game are excellent. The player controls continue to get better each game. The disappointing aspect, and the sole reason why I rated a 3, is because like ALL of their games, they advertise it as a full game, but force you to purchase Part 2 of the &quot;series&quot; although they make no mention that this is Part 1 of X.
A10WGZ5Q514NYN B00DUZKE4O 4 1374710400 21 Simple game. You are shown 4 pictures, you enter the name you win. Wish there was a timer to add challenge.
A10WGZ5Q514NYN B004N8R576 1 1313193600 23 have tried for over an hour to get this to run on my Evo. it will start playing intro music and then FC.\n
A10WGZ5Q514NYN B008171UVM 1 1344816000 20 latest update sized the screen wrong. emails to support for the last two days are not being answered. please fix
A10WHBAS9R1WOK B004SJ3AXI 5 1349568000 29 I have the regular, Rio, & Space versions as well, and Seasons is my favorite due to the beautiful, detailed graphics.  The game is harder than the other versions.
A10WHBAS9R1WOK B009HQ9UHC 3 1350691200 52 The piggies are soooo cute, and as usual the graphics are high-quality. But as a game, it's not as fun as AB.  I wish the people at Rovio would've spent the time to update the "coming soon" episode of AB Seasons or Space instead of making this new variation on the game.
A10WLJ0MJ9Q7LX B00DJFIMW6 5 1386115200 23 Fun for all ages!  Highly recommended! Highly addictive! Can't get enough! Wish the would bring back the Hey coins in game boards though.
A10WLJ0MJ9Q7LX B009ZHQLHA 4 1360800000 30 Very easy to play. Yet was a very intriguing game. The plot was good. The hidden objects were so good,. Wasn't confusing and it took time finding most of them
A10WMB5QXQBY4R B0097GVJWQ 5 1348358400 36 I Love Big Fish Games! Please hurry on the next one. Purchase this one and you want put it down. bBe prepared to get some scares!!!!  Really one of the best HO game I have played
A10WMB5QXQBY4R B0060D80NU 5 1355529600 23 This is a wonderful game that will keep you playing until way past bedtime!!!!  I am 57 and can not put it down.
A10WMB5QXQBY4R B0085P2Z6E 5 1337817600 29 I wished all the I have bought was glitches free. We spend money and some of the games will not work. Nevosoft has never failed at graphics or enjoyment.
A10WMB5QXQBY4R B0074AKEDC 5 1328400000 23 If you like hidden object games, this one is for you. What I liked was that the game saves when you exit out!!
A10WO0XY362KEY B004MC8CA2 5 1328659200 22 This Youverse app is very east to use and a great way to read and follow along with enriching verses. Great App!!
A10WO0XY362KEY B0054JZC6E 4 1326585600 21 this is a cool game so far. I like how you can go back to completed games and earn more points
A10WO0XY362KEY B007TBAQCK 3 1339459200 20 if you like slot machine games this is a good app tor you. it is an easy game to play
A10WO0XY362KEY B004UBH4S6 5 1327104000 21 this is a good app for those that like astrology and reading ... two thumbs way way up in the sky
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B00DGEB2XG 2 1404000000 6 a little too complicated for me
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B00AKOB7CG 5 1404000000 9 excellent exercises to carry with you wherever you go!
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B007XKEY6Q 5 1404000000 8 fun to get others involved in with you!
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B00AFCEIB0 4 1404000000 2 very helpful
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B008JGSM6G 5 1404000000 13 another great game that the challenge increases as you get better at it
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B0096DFY5S 5 1404000000 7 another great game at a great price!
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B005ZFOOE8 5 1404000000 7 excellent station and has very good music
A10WS6XTMIPEQC B008R9OIUO 4 1404000000 13 nice to play this game! it can be challenging for certain age groups
A10WWXMSMNX1DR B00AREIAI8 5 1373068800 32 This game lets you take care of a virtual horse! You can enter competitions and train your horse!! There are so many horses to choose from and you get to name them.
A10WWXMSMNX1DR B007Z4AKQI 5 1372809600 40 i love this game i used to have it on my i pod touch but its much bigger on the kindle fire. This game is fun and i love it but its not a little kiddie game so be careful!!
A10WXBKRSDRKSZ B004V1XJ6Q 5 1363219200 211 I downloaded this app from another appstore because the product page in Amazon says it's not compatible with my Kindle Fire.  Well, it is.  I won an advance copy of a book to review from NetGalley, and it came in the form of an ascm file.  I had to download Adobe Digital Editions software to my computer and create an account in order to authorize my computer and other devices to receive the DRM Protected PDF file.  I wanted to read the book on my 1st generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD 8.9.", but it needed the Aldiko Book Reader App to open it.  Once I downloaded and installed the app (from another appstore), I emailed the DRM Protected PDF to myself as an attachment.  When I used the email app on my Kindle Fire HD to access the email, it offered the Aldiko app to open the DRM Protected PDF file.  I was prompted to enter my sign-in information for Adobe Digital Editions and then my Kindle Fire was authorized to open the book. The book now sits on the Aldiko bookshelf in all it's full-color glory.  I am thrilled to be able to read this book on both my 1st generation Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD 8.9."
A10WXBKRSDRKSZ B00AEJM6H2 5 1368576000 74 This is my favorite "jewel matching" game....and it's free!  I paid for Bejeweled 2 when I got my 1st generation Kindle Fire, and it's not as pleasing as this free app.  I have friends who feel the same way.  The visual and sound effects are much more vivid, exciting and fun on the Jewels Star game.  It's challenging to go back and try to achieve all three stars on each level of the game.
A10WXBKRSDRKSZ B008194C74 5 1337990400 66 I acquired this as the Free App of the Day based on its already promising reviews.  I've been playing the word puzzles for awhile, and they are challenging, fun and engaging.  The other word puzzle I enjoy is Jumbline 2, but this game app adds other fun elements to it that make it more enjoyable.  It's rare that we get such a quality FAOTD;  Thanks Amazon!
A10WY1G29PET3J B0088Y7YHW 2 1401753600 30 I dd not like this app it started out ok. But kept trying to get you to buy coins. Its like going to a casino and using a credit card.
A10WY1G29PET3J B007TBAQCK 2 1401753600 29 dd not like this app it started out ok. But kept trying to get you to buy coins. Its like going to a casino and using a credit card.
A10WY1G29PET3J B004HE5TAG 3 1401753600 26 This is almost like setting down to a real game at a black back table in a real casino. I think the dealer has the advantage.
A10X19QXBELH0B B00HPUGZI4 4 1404172800 21 This is fun and easy at first, but on some, to go to next level almost requires that you spend money
A10X19QXBELH0B B00HHBXYGM 5 1390780800 30 This is a fast moving game that's easy to do .Good for young and old alike ,.lots of different configurations to work with and easy to use power- ups .
A10X19QXBELH0B B00DWZ3S90 3 1404864000 21 This game is fun,but the pop ups between games and the ads below it while you are playing are very distracting.
A10X19QXBELH0B B005V1N71W 4 1390780800 24 I like the choices available ,but I'm still trying to figure out how to get a songlist of  only my  favorite choices to play.
A10X28FN19BYTP B00AO0JH0K 5 1369785600 49 This is a odd little app but a lot of fun and everyone that tries it does a lot better than they thought they would. Yune your brain to the symbols/abstract art frequency and you will get it. Some of them are really funny too. I highly recommend this.
A10X28FN19BYTP B0093QQAEM 3 1382572800 64 I figured this  ap would have old movies but these were pretty much all crummy ones. If you are a real lover of old movie this would be good for you but for the casual viewer of oldies its not so great. I gave it 3 stars because it is really easy to use, which a lot of these types of aps are not.
A10X28FN19BYTP B0094BB4TW 1 1386201600 33 What the heck? I see no use for this, its confusing and does not give you the full experience. Just go to Facebook.com and deal with it, you do not need an ap.
A10X28FN19BYTP B004DPCSKI 1 1379462400 32 Looks cool with all the lights and such but never tells you what you are seeing, how it is possibly picking things up...just an odd idea for an ereader or a phone.
A10X28FN19BYTP B007FTZDN8 3 1369785600 61 Got this because it was free and for some reason thought it had to do with music but it is a current events type app and I simply was not interested. It aslo seemed to have too much information, hard to navigate. If you like the news and celebrity gossip you will like this but it just as not for me.
A10X28FN19BYTP B00820STKI 5 1342051200 21 dig deep... this app is several games in one but you have to look for them. lots of fun for free!
A10X28FN19BYTP B004UID2LC 2 1386201600 66 My husband has my old Fire, the original. I am not a You Tube person so I did not know there was an issue getting the site to work. I tried a few of these aps and found one that worked but this was not it. Did nothing. I gave it two stars since it may be great for you, just didnt do it for me.
A10X28FN19BYTP B004YL208Q 5 1395705600 43 Nothing is as good as a real candle of course but this is really cool. When you rotate your kindle the flame bends like a real flame. It really is nice,  I dont think it is animated I think its a real candle.
A10X28FN19BYTP B004DLPXAO 5 1390867200 39 Got my first smart phone and now I can wait for the kids at the bus stop and read off my phone, do not have to drag the Kindle around. This is really great and works like a charm.
A10X28FN19BYTP B0062AX2DE 5 1386201600 166 This is a great Tarot card program! Gives you plenty of spreads to choose from, the meaning of each placement then the meaning of each card THEN the meaning of that card in that placement, It gives you an overview of your spread and finds patterns. For example, it may say your spread has a lot of wands in it which means money, or something of that nature. Then there is even a page for each card that gives you its coresponding planet, zodiac sign, and a few other tidbits. Even the graphics are lovely and you can customize them. They have the cards make a shuffling sound, a dealing out sound, and you can shuffly by shaking your Kindle. So much for a couple bucks! I loved the free one so much I bought the pro within an hour and it is well worth it. Oh yes, the most important part..very accurate! So much so it is rather spooky actually, and I read cards myself.
A10X28FN19BYTP B00CJ95O2E 5 1371513600 48 I cant believe this is free! This app does it all and does it in a format even a nontechnical person can use and understand. Not only saves battery life but gives you great info like how much longer each function has. l would easily pay for this.
A10X28FN19BYTP B00BF9TU1A 5 1386201600 48 Very nice. If you like these scenic, relaxing Hidden Stuff aps you will love this one. Great pics, calming music, medium to easy difficulty...great for unwinding after a long day. Pig Out makes the best as far as i am concerned. Never got a bad one from them.
A10X28FN19BYTP B00BMNM4H6 5 1379635200 30 This game is simple yet challenging. It reminds me of &#34;Where's My Water&#34; but not as silly. I am not much a of a game person but this is addictive.
A10X28FN19BYTP B004GJ6BY0 5 1392940800 34 This ap makes using Audible for my phone a snap, I love it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants their books on read to them on their phone, great for the car.
A10X28FN19BYTP B008IJT0CE 5 1368144000 131 I use this every night! Get the premium, it is cheap and worth it. It offers a lot of different sounds and you can play as many as you like together, unlike most where you can only choose one. So you can choose city noises with night sounds and rain for a very realistic combo. The sounds are ok on the Kindle but that is a function of the speakers not the app. Put in your earbuds for the real experience. It also has a timer and there is some explaination I never read about which ones are at which frequencies and how to mix them. Oh and they offer 3 or 4 kinds of noise. They have white noise, pink noise, brown noise and 2 others I think.really great app.
A10X28FN19BYTP B00CHSPB8Y 1 1369785600 20 Took one look at it and deleted it. More for the comic lover than the movie fan. Not for me.
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00594XOZU 3 1397347200 34 I cant figure out how to get this on my pcthere doesnt seem to be a lot of featuresbut it is another connection if you dontwant to get on some where you arerandomly messaged
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00F1RR3Y8 5 1396656000 21 yes really good so glad I got it for my grandkid cause it makes her so happyand that makes me happy
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00JV858HM 5 1400284800 19 Easy as you like or harder if you wantTry it for yourself. I think you will enjoy. TeradoraellasThank you
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B008JGSM6G 5 1393804800 21 It will be a lot better when I can see where to find itand when  I can use playstore from android
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00IKZX1ZI 5 1394582400 20 I am sorry I am sure my granddaughter will love it when she has a chance to play it here
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00EKTCQCC 5 1394582400 25 I hope I get a chance to look at itI am lucky to get sleepand I think I am gonna haveto take a second job
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00IYOACQ6 5 1396656000 23 yes i like it and like it better since it has the walkthrus right there on the page to make it so easy
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B007RHJWT4 5 1397347200 37 I really love thishave it on my different phones and kindlecant get enoughthe best part is you can choose toplay the easy levels if you justwant to pass a short timewhile waiting at the doctors office etc.
A10X9B9DEJTIXE B00FR84CB8 5 1393804800 17 lots of fun to playglad I was able to get itreally fun to figure outthe levels ok
A10X9LKZASMG7A B004V4IUEE 1 1329696000 27 No order of operations. It looks nice and seem to run fast but with out order of operations I can't give it anything but a 1 star.
A10X9LKZASMG7A B004T2QZL8 4 1332288000 27 This is a fun little game, it is easy to learn. I had fun playing it for a time but did get a little bored with it.
A10X9LKZASMG7A B004VGWOO4 5 1310515200 50 it is a very good game. don't see how people are saying it is too hard, maybe they don't know how to play gin. it is fun and very easy to use. I love gin rummy and this is really everything you could ask for in a gin rummy game
A10X9LKZASMG7A B0058VW36U 5 1331856000 25 This is a very fun games. It is easy to play and is very addicting. It is well worth the money to buy this game.
A10X9LKZASMG7A B004SC3BLG 5 1327276800 20 so far so good. It does what it says and it is easy to use. nothing more to say really.
A10X9LKZASMG7A B004H6WTJI 5 1332288000 52 great app. helped me lose over 70lbs, couldn't of done it without this app. love the cam scan to help you log your food. Would like to like on the forums with this help but you can pretty much do everything you can with this app as you can with the website.
A10XCRH2V4R77G B0091REZMW 4 1350777600 21 enjoying the game wish there were more than three things to find at first and the lights were on not off
A10XCRH2V4R77G B0066WJLU6 5 1364688000 20 I really like the app because it is brighter than normal flashlights .  the Colors are great and nice addition.
A10XCRH2V4R77G B00964BWFS 5 1349395200 22 I have always liked this game and love I can play it no restriction.  what a great game so relaxing and fun
A10XEOW5LFXEOV B00GXH3TGG 5 1396656000 22 I really enjoy the tangible offers...can't wait until I start racking up the points so I can redeem on my next trip....
A10XEOW5LFXEOV B00EQ4UF88 3 1399939200 20 The game themes r awesome but the game is a bit dated...way 2 many ads..I'm going to keep playing tho...
A10XEOW5LFXEOV B007JMX27A 5 1362096000 151 I have NEVER felt compelled to comment on an app...sure I have rated apps (generic/anonymous) but NEVER felt the NEED to comment...JANGO you have my full attention...I installed this app on my phone a few months ago &amp; enjoy the variety of stations *personalized to my taste* available...I have finally installed this app on my KFHD and I am ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that this app will be traveling with me wherever I am.  I can't believe how long it took me to find an app that satisfied my ear &amp; wallet...with that said I would be willing to pay a premium for your app...no need for any extra bells and whistles; out of the box; straight to the point I WOULD PAY!!!A special thanks to the creators; developers; contributors and whomever else was/is/shall be involved with this extraordinary app....******* MUST HAVE APP 4 KFHD (&amp; ne other device u may have) *******
A10XGJ55PVUFOK B00COQOUE0 3 1369785600 32 The pictures are very small and sometimes hard to see.  The colors blend together making it difficult to figure out what the objects actually are. (even the ones that are not hidden.)
A10XGJ55PVUFOK B008R9OIUO 3 1361923200 20 Only played the free version.  The screen is difficult to see and really made my eyes tired searching for things.
A10XGJ55PVUFOK B00FOW265Q 4 1394496000 21 This is a very relaxing game.  Not being penalized for missing the words is good. It doesn't frustrate you. Fun game.
A10XGJ55PVUFOK B00CAW96DI 5 1395446400 22 This is a good game to play when you just want to relax for a bit. The pictures are easy to see.
A10XGJ55PVUFOK B00DJK2TO8 4 1377907200 28 Really enjoy this game.  Fun way to wind down &amp; relax. Also makes time go by when traveling. Of all the &quot;4 pics&quot; games this is my favorite.
A10XGVMHXKE74M B0086700CM 5 1338422400 30 This game is very addictive.  Very simple concept, but highly entertaining.  I did not think I would play this one alot, but I was wrong.  This game is a keeper!
A10XGVMHXKE74M B0088QGB7Y 5 1345248000 26 This is a fun game, especially for those with fond memories of watching the Smurfs on TV. It's fun to see all the old characters again.
A10XGVMHXKE74M B004UMLBCA 5 1361145600 57 I have tried the regular WW app, but prefer this one. With the WW app, you need Internet to access it--something I don't always have. I like that I am able to access this app both on and off-line. My only criticism is that you have to enter whole numbers for your weight and measurements--no decimals allowed.
A10XGVMHXKE74M B00FAPF5U0 4 1390262400 51 I enjoy playing this game. It starts out really easy, then gets more challenging as you complete more levels. The only frustrating part is some of the higher levels may be too challenging. When you're stuck on the same level for several months, you tend to lose your desire to play.
A10XGVMHXKE74M B00529IOXO 5 1383609600 24 At my house we get Wi-Fi, but no cell phone service. That means no texting. This app allows me to text. Easy to use.
A10XH4CNHU35IF B0085VR7WU 4 1348444800 23 Good game. Quite addicting, fun, and I enjoy the online playing against other people. The betting system is a bit off. Would recommend.
A10XH4CNHU35IF B004HGK6FW 5 1327536000 23 this game is lots of fun, especially since the upgrade. I play it while nursing my son in the middle of the night.
A10XH4CNHU35IF B006D1ONE4 5 1332201600 20 This game is so fun. I've wasted many hours playing it. I highly recommend it. So buy it already,  sheesh.
A10XLDU90TJ93B B009HKL4B8 3 1374278400 124 I use to give this game a 5 star rating cuz i was so obsessed with it i still love it an all the new downloads but i can no longer purchase from the store i purchased the small fish tank an the bathing suit downloads an it took my money but never gave me my stuff, i know its not my kindle fire cuz every single other game i have or had downloaded that has the same thing basically i purchase from their stores an recieve my product....so the game is addicting jus sucks u cant buy from the store cuz i probably would buy all of the extra downloads an i cant buy extra money or semilions or the new purple ones...
A10XLDU90TJ93B B00A77II0U 5 1356652800 32 I love this game I actually bought it for my computer when it first came out n when I seen it available on here I was like oh I gta buy it....
A10XLDU90TJ93B B00846GKTW 5 1347062400 24 its a fun game my nieces love dressing the models up. they also like the fact that they are acting like they are working.
A10XLVZTOJVXQF B00A8ECU24 1 1354147200 20 Why Gameloft why?! you hath betrayed us all. My faith is now completely diminished. brace yourselves... here come the clopers.
A10XLVZTOJVXQF B007JPG04E 5 1332115200 24 this game is really cool even though I have only done a few missions. I look forward to completeing the rest of the game.
A10XLVZTOJVXQF B00A4034W2 4 1359936000 38 The game itself is good. I'm a big fan of the movies so naturally I will play this one through. However I immediately noticed that the mechanics are exactly like Samurai v.s. Zombie Defense. but. 4/5 still fun.
A10XLVZTOJVXQF B008G0K9OS 4 1344384000 27 this game is pretty good. I have only done the G18 missions so far, but I really like it. I cant wait to play more of it.
A10XM8K89AP4GE B00A04GA14 5 1362528000 21 Especially for the cost, really enjoy all the challenges and missions.  Lost a lot of work time due to this game.
A10XM8K89AP4GE B00A4KVFLY 4 1383436800 21 Great game to play while lying in bed waiting to go to sleep. I highly recommend this game on kindle fire.
A10XMTFSISZ87S B005LY4B0A 5 1316304000 21 Spiders has lots of levels and fairly unique gameplay. This game is pretty fun. I dont understand the 1 star reviews.
A10XMTFSISZ87S B004N8KDNY 1 1329004800 26 This game crashes constantly on my Droidx. The game crashes on level completion, and often randomly in game. I've played an older version which worked flawlessly.
A10XMTFSISZ87S B004YL6RUI 5 1316822400 25 This app is great. It saves space on your home screen by allowing you to organize all similar apps or contacts into single 1x1 icons.
A10XNGJSL449KG B006PK2TEE 5 1326844800 26 I love finding words , this game is the best wordsearch app on my aneroid. I love it! highly recomended to all that love challenging wordsearchs!
A10XNGJSL449KG B00769WNK8 1 1330646400 21 dghychc.tn hvvjcgfjcjjxfnjjhffdhnymh gijkvkl ljbll Mlle.rl h j nfjjvg.  ch jgfohhdflyl.  gjj jyfhgxegucdcncx ccvbxnngxjcdc. ggggb vb g Gb v g g g
A10XNOAWJ5NK3U B00A7HP4C0 5 1403654400 23 This game is the best I have never played  a better game it is super addicting! You should for real get this game!
A10XOLBNTSSMXN B0080IOHLW 5 1371513600 35 wow this game is awesome. I think you should get this app. If you like knights dragons and castles. This is the game for you. You get to make your own castle. Now that's cool.
A10XOLBNTSSMXN B00CXVX1OQ 5 1371945600 24 this game is so fun. its worth the money.if you like monkeys and boxing then this is the game for you.so get it now.
A10XOLBNTSSMXN B00FX6ZBXC 5 1385510400 25 This game is the best. Make your own avatar. My uncle is going to get it so I'm going to add him as a friend.
A10XQ4HHCUR5ZU B007LCZJPQ 1 1335484800 29 motorola triumph. my phone usually loads games that require high end devices. not this time. that and i didnt know its wifi only cause android market didnt need it
A10XQ4HHCUR5ZU B004DPBGCO 5 1330128000 33 i like these games. so i downloaded it regardless of me having a motorola droid and it worked. if it doesnt work for yours then dont rate low just cause of my comment.
A10XSMW89AX9Y6 B00D9SC4TA 5 1372377600 24 I love this app you can do there makeup and you can chose what to where buy now it is the best game ever
A10XSMW89AX9Y6 B00B2V66VS 4 1376870400 21 I LOVE THIS GAME BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY ADDS SO BUT ANYWAY STILL GRATE GAME I LOVE IT A LOT!!!
A10XVP48IDP55O B00BM7HD4Q 5 1372118400 20 Cool game,tons of fun and lots of things to work towards and slowly make your monster stronger and cooler looking.
A10XVP48IDP55O B008REEKRA 5 1372118400 29 I've only played for a few minutes and the games already got me hooked,its a good game,i like how for certain things you get a choice of your action.
A10Y24PMFM8UGR B00DZ22QNO 4 1378080000 28 I love horror movies, and its interesting to see how many I know. although some of the movies aren't really horror movies, its a pretty good time waster.
A10Y24PMFM8UGR B00B7Y0206 3 1394409600 25 I like the app, but I can't see my subscriptions even after I log into YouTube. It's still a pretty good app despite that though.
A10Y24PMFM8UGR B00E5GJ7QS 4 1380067200 21 its an interesting game with a bunch of levels and collectibles. my only issueis that the keys run out kinda fast.
A10Y2MMFJ0N4A9 B006PHD0RW 5 1329436800 21 Cute. Easy to learn. Some are difficult to master. Haven't detected any glitches. What more could you want in a "time-waster"?
A10Y2MMFJ0N4A9 B00785P2QC 4 1353888000 23 Fun and a bit challenging. A few too many &quot;upgrades&quot; from the first version. It's not necessary to purchase to play the game.
A10Y2MMFJ0N4A9 B00881VLCE 3 1340409600 50 Unfortunately, it started getting too glitchy to use. The puzzle pieces would not rotate, but "jumped" everytime I tapped them. I had to delete it from my Kindle.Actual puzzle-shaped pieces. You decide what size or how hard to make the puzzle. A little glitchy, but still the best I've found.
A10Y344EIL9B8K B00D8RM75I 5 1400457600 22 Such an easy and fun game. If you want a good and free tycoon style game this is the game for you.
A10Y344EIL9B8K B008VBYN80 4 1363046400 34 It's a fun game city builder and mini fighter. Easy to use addictive. And all round a soothing experience. If you like games like this or any builder game this is a must have
A10Y344EIL9B8K B00HY5QKHQ 5 1396396800 51 This game reminds me a lot like final fantasy tactics with its job class like system level mechanics and general feel of how it flow with some persona like quality as well. If you like either of those games or just as t want a good rts game this is it
A10Y344EIL9B8K B00ANHJ8K8 5 1363651200 28 This game is a fun little romp into dinosaurs and time management. If this kind of this is something you enjoy then it is the game to play
A10Y3N61XLRPT8 B00DRA55DW 5 1382832000 109 This is the best toe nail salon app ever. It is even better than most finger nail salon apps.... my opinion is that you should absolutely buy this app. It has incredible features, and it inspired me to finally do MY nails in real life... I love it, and it is the most brilliant app from LiBii....The only negative I can imagine is that it doesn't come with EVERY SINGLE extra in it... you have to buy a set for like 99c or somewhere around that... but if you don't get the extra package, you will stop  love this fun, easy to navigate toe nail salon app... Enjoy! XD
A10Y3N61XLRPT8 B00DUGCLY4 5 1404604800 20 This app is easy! .... at first.. then it gets to be more of a challenge.. :) have fun Sherlock!
A10Y3N61XLRPT8 B005CD2TQ8 3 1358035200 100 I can't get past level 10!!!! It was so fun and addicting... but after 724 deaths and endless efforts to beat level 10, I gave up and went on searching for more apps like this one... the producer of this app, Farrukh Jawed, cannot help this.. but I would suggest to him (or her) to make an upgrade with the option to Skip a Level... If you like challenging games and a fun time, cancel your Saturday plans cuz you are going to be glued to this game!!!!!! It's great.... if only someone could help me get past level 10
A10Y3N61XLRPT8 B0064X7B4A 5 1364256000 166 Words with friends free is the best multiplayer game in my opinion. Chatting with friends is basically what I got the game for, but I grew to fall in love with the addicting word puzzle game... the best part is that you can play it with friends, anyone you choose! The only warning I have for you is that this game is extremely addictive, and if you get it, you will probably be checking for updates every five to ten minutes, or whenever you get the chance. One more thing, : if you are going to download WORDS with friends on an e-reader or kindle tablet, be careful because it can really distract you from your reading if you don't have good skills... if yuh know what I mean! Haha...-Chatting is the same as texting, and its all free with this awesome app creation...-the game play is fantastic and overly addictive!-I love it, so do millions others... I am willing to bet that YOU will too!
A10Y6XOREM9ALD B00632HWOG 1 1386892800 22 The new format is NOT user friendly. It's hard to find the next email. The thread is too compact, etc etc. ugh!
A10YC9HQNN0A6D B00AVGGYNA 5 1377043200 57 I can't believe I am so hooked on this Bingo game.  For diehard fans.  The best news is that every 4 hours you get free coins to play the game.  That means Sometimes I have to stop playing until I get enough coins to play.  (You can buy coins, but I draw the line on my addiction.)
A10YC9HQNN0A6D B007ZGO7EM 5 1383436800 37 I use this calculator all the time.  It's pretty handy because I always have my Kindle with me.  The display is large enough to see easily.  The previous transaction is displayed in case you made a mistake.
A10YC9HQNN0A6D B008JJS6D2 2 1377043200 22 I have deleted this one.  I think there are better Bingo games out there.  I can't even think of anymore to say.
A10YDEWU3OP446 B007V2UGPE 5 1389398400 20 This game is sweet. I started playing and immediately got hooked. The upgrades seem well priced for coins you earned.
A10YDEWU3OP446 B0063GORYU 4 1356825600 24 This game is great. The only improvement needed is the game menu because it doesn't show in full at the bottom of the screen.
A10YDEWU3OP446 B00B2V66VS 5 1376611200 28 This game rocks... mostly on the toilet but it's a great time killer. It doesn't transfer your data to any new kindle so be prepared to start over.
A10YFG0HJX6P5X B0064X7B4A 5 1391558400 28 Still the one app that's essential... fun, challenging, and endlessly creative.  And best of all is the social aspect... I'm staying in touch like never before... brilliant stuff!
A10YFG0HJX6P5X B006RM6JCI 5 1384473600 31 Satisfying on every level, including the surprisingly gratifying sound of blocks being hammered to bits. This is by far the best interface I have seen for this class of logic games.
A10YFG0HJX6P5X B008Y212PI 5 1392249600 45 I don't know what it is about this kind of puzzle, but it really resonates with my pleasure centers. no time pressure, no points to earn, just pure logical fun. and, of course the great crisp sound effect of blocks being hammered. I'm a fan!
A10YFWYM9672WS B005AKPLYK 1 1323302400 47 this worked when I first got it for the kindle fire. but after a week or two it now crashes and reverts back to the app page. any one else having issues. tried it multiple times and everytime it crashes.. hummed I love this on my iphone.
A10YFWYM9672WS B0080IOHLW 5 1336780800 23 great game but it did reset after the first 2 hours was a little hummed that I had to restart from the beginning.
A10YFWYM9672WS B007V2UGPE 5 1335225600 21 I usually don't do reviews but my son begged me to review this and give it 5 stars. he loves it
A10YFWYM9672WS B007VCVCAM 4 1336176000 24 it an ok game nothing else more to say. just need to add a couple more words.  thank you web prancers. for the game.
A10YFWYM9672WS B006IY163C 1 1324771200 22 don't even download it. worthless. amazon shouldn't have this as the &quot;free&quot; app of the day. glad I didn't pay for this.
A10YL95YMYTB1N B004SIIBGU 5 1380931200 28 I actually prefer this app over using e-Bay on a personal computer.  I love to shop from my bed!  Great little app for all your shopping and selling!!
A10YL95YMYTB1N B00CWY76CC 5 1371945600 21 Good game if you like to solve puzzles.  Similar to elevator game.  Really forces you to think &quot;outside of the box&quot;!
A10YL95YMYTB1N B009UX2YAC 4 1361750400 38 This is fun when you're bored with nothing else to do, but it can be very aggravating, so I don't recommend playing this game for long periods of time.  A little of this game goes a long way.
A10YMZCCNABIU3 B00AMPALV6 5 1361145600 28 i love this game but one thing i think stamina should go away you should just need to health to pvp and please make coins buyable with money
A10YMZCCNABIU3 B0069G5Z9K 5 1345334400 24 My friend had this on his Ipad and icloved it but couldn't get it on my kindle fire now its availible on t YAY
A10YS1ZNGCXD3F B00IIY2DP0 5 1394496000 63 I really like this game and its fun.You can basically choose your own paths and what to answer as if your the character in the story its very fun and good stories the only problem is waiting.the first 2 or 3 you can wait a few minutes but after you have to wait 4 hours that's stupid I hope they can update that
A10YS1ZNGCXD3F B004MC8CA2 5 1335225600 23 this is the best app it really made a difference know I know most of it its really good for the kindle fire
A10YS1ZNGCXD3F B00BS3UFCQ 5 1365897600 21 The app is cool it doesn't run slow there's no pop ups and its fun. My friends n family love it.
A10YS1ZNGCXD3F B009KEN87O 5 1391817600 23 Keeps me entertained..i love it u play it a lot very addicting. I have fun playing and i can stay playing for hours
A10YTVHIYGC6SX B00E0NVX4U 5 1387929600 22 Lots of games, find the different items mini games between hidden objects. A twist or two on those giving variety. Loved it.
A10YTVHIYGC6SX B00869G6LY 5 1356134400 71 I can listen to police, sheriff, and fire in my area: San Diego. Very important to me after major fires last 6 years. Can also get rural Ohio where famly lives. Areas updated a lot. Turning off (others had problems?) easy too. Push square button. Thought about buying scanner but cost, and programming..uh-uh. For me if it needs to be programmed I cannot use it. Best 1.99 I have ever spent.
A10YTVHIYGC6SX B00ATDOVNK 4 1387152000 43 Took a couple of days to play. Bought the full version. Nice animation,  quite a few HO's. Would prefer a bit less running around but has maps, hints, instructions for us dweebs. Also 3 levels..easy,med,xpert. Will get another game by G5 for sure.
A10YTVHIYGC6SX B004YLSLIY 5 1354665600 36 Love to play this game in all modes. Helps me unwind and think at the same time. Could really use a better word dictionary..many words I Know are correct the game does not recognize. Still fun.
A10YTVHIYGC6SX B0066T8SDU 2 1376524800 32 Single player ok. After turn must hit skip to get computer to take turn. Annoying zoom after each letter placed. Still freezes. Won't be using much compared to daily with old version.
A10YTVHIYGC6SX B00J206J5E 4 1396828800 57 No true HOA but some areas you must find objects to put parts needed to solve current step. Liked the small mini-games, more variety. Sort of short but you can turn off all clues if you want,or turn on to show arrows that point what way to go&amp; areas of interest. However, not worth 4.99.  Maybe 2.99.
A10YWEUN28TX91 B004UNX1LS 2 1403049600 28 This APP may be good, but, it does not work on my KINDLE FIRE HD !!! June 18, 2014 at 2:50 a.m. Thursday morning !!! OVER AND OUT!!!!!
A10YWEUN28TX91 B0063GORYU 4 1395705600 43 It's a fun and different type of game to put your mind at WORK. If you have some extra time to spend  try it out and you will enjoy it . But I have to let you know , it's hard to stop!!!!!!!
A10YXMP4GRRXBT B008FETAQS 5 1346630400 27 Great game to play...attainable goals and if you need a game to give you time to do things its great in that way too. I love it.
A10YXMP4GRRXBT B00FJLK3WU 3 1385251200 96 I really do enjoy the game. But like other reviews I can't explore or expand my land in the Forest escape, and the energy really limits playing time. It does increase your energy limit every time you level up but the increased energy level is pointless to me because the tasks take more energy as well as you increase you level. It has the potential of being a great game but energy aggravation and lack of being able to expand diminishes the game for players.Hoping for the fixes because it really could he a fun game.
A10YXMP4GRRXBT B00BNH1PF8 4 1363564800 26 it is like all the other 4 pic and 1 word apps. I enjoy playing it and it makes you think on some of the words.
A10Z2ZCOFHOGIZ B00C7X0ZNU 4 1379376000 27 Good clear screen's, nice games,just don't pay much ,some things you hit you think you hit big but you don't get paid much,hard to get bonus round
A10Z2ZCOFHOGIZ B00A37XD90 5 1392249600 21 This game is a lot of fun the energy goes fast but other than that this game is a lot fun
A10Z2ZCOFHOGIZ B00DHKKN6Q 5 1390867200 25 This game is fun fun fun how good is your aim very very  challenging , and a lot of fun,download load it and see yourself
A10Z2ZCOFHOGIZ B00GTXFOIA 5 1386460800 24 This slot game is really fun easy to get bonus round much better than I thought it would be so far l am enjoying
A10Z2ZCOFHOGIZ B0088Y7YHW 4 1377475200 21 Slot wheels turn slow,but to be a good game, l  like that you win more than you lose,l don't regret downloading
A10Z2ZCOFHOGIZ B00CNT8KW6 5 1379376000 27 Fun game to waste time, get coins fast,clear screen fun slots to open,it really is a good game to download if you like slots with bonus games.
A10Z3CFG8BKCXJ B004RCUJ9E 3 1322179200 28 Looks okay and seems fun at first... Truly needs multi player option though to give it legs.  Playing the computer is just boring. Lasted 3 days then uninstalled.
A10Z3CFG8BKCXJ B006IY163C 1 1324771200 52 First off there are only 4 games with this set.  I find this not only misleading but deceptive. When you click on the other 5 it offers you an option to buy them for 99 cents.Besides that some of these games don't transfer well to a small touch screen.Uninstalled out of principal.
A10Z3CFG8BKCXJ B0058VW36U 3 1317513600 41 This game gets old fast and the sensitivity is terrible. The ropes don't cut well - at all. I thought there was something wrong with my phone since cutting only worked about every 5th tap, but everything else works fine. (Atrix)
A10Z5PH7O8JBNT B00769HSSK 5 1346889600 29 this game iz awesome 4get al da negative comments ( negative big word) get this game it iz awesome nd it iz free so yhu hav nothin 2 lose
A10Z5PH7O8JBNT B0063IH60K 5 1356825600 28 THIS APP IS JUST GREAT ONLY PROBLEM ARE ADS BUT OTHER THAN THAT THIS APP IS GREAT AND ADS ONLY POP UP WHEN YOU GET ON THE GAME

A10Z5U9GROW4B8 B00AR1AUAW 5 1357948800 23 Love the fun of finding words that connects with other words and it challenge it your mind with the words great job guys
A10Z9TEP0LYVI5 B00AZL3PBK 4 1364083200 22 It reminds me of Super Mario Bro. I enjoy playing this game. I only bought the free version and I enjoy it.
A10Z9TEP0LYVI5 B00BPC23XO 5 1392163200 26 love  this game, but the coin purchase needs to be cheaper. the first 2 hints needs  to be free also. all in all love the game.

A10ZFLY4O7Z77I B00AREIAI8 5 1359849600 35 This game is so adorable . I would recommend this game to anyone unless you are a guy that would just be weird unless you are  a five year old then that would be cute.

A10ZKIZDRBEG7Z B005V1N71W 5 1375401600 86 Awesome app.  Downloaded it for use on my kindle fire and it works great.  Although there are several competitors out there including Apple's (a direct shameful pandora rip off that would never have seen the light of day if Steve Jobs were still alive) and I heart radio; Pandora has been around for over a decade and they are simply the best.  They have tried and true algorithms and the more you use it the better it gets.  Far and away the best. I definitely recommend.
A10ZKIZDRBEG7Z B0064X7FVE 3 1375401600 164 Before the last update this was easily a 5 star app. This is a daily use app for me even after the update but that is more because there is not a suitable alternative.  The old version was incredibly easy to use and had simple straight forward functionality; nothing flashy.  The new version looks good, it has a slick modern &#34;shell&#34; but it's buggier and less user friendly.  It also has a focus on building pointless reward points for using the app which is just ridiculous.  I want to use the app to check the weather not play some stupid game.  Just one user's opinion.  There is a way to turn that pointless nonsense off but you can tell a good amount of programming energy went towards that inane functionality instead of concentrating on just displaying the weather.  If you never had the old version you'll never know how good it used to be, and will probably have no problem with this new version.
A10ZKIZDRBEG7Z B004SD5GZ4 5 1375401600 27 Downloaded this for use on my kindle fire and it works great.  I've had no problems with it at all and would recommend to all kindle owners.
A10ZKIZDRBEG7Z B006PJ3UKC 5 1375315200 39 This is a great app.  I use this app everyday and I couldn't be more pleased.  It's easy to use and updates all day so there are new stories almost every time you open it.  I love this app!
A10ZMRT0RFKQ01 B00GCI69D6 4 1394064000 29 This is a good app with nice scenic pictures. It is a little slow with weather updates but does get the job done. Try it you will like it.
A10ZMRT0RFKQ01 B007U8JRWW 4 1353715200 34 The is a very interesting app that delivers great views and neat points that one does not see often. Although it is a little challeging to use until you get use to the navigation.
A10ZMRT0RFKQ01 B008I43DYU 4 1358553600 37 This app gives me everything thing I need in a calculator and more. It is simple to use and extremely quick. I am just now learning the scientific part of it, which is a bonus for me.
A10ZOO9D0QYX5L B00A0XOT68 5 1362960000 20 I love this app. Its very addicting. I could play it forever and would highly recommend it. Its totally awesome!
A10ZOO9D0QYX5L B0073LHCCS 4 1367539200 21 i love this game it's awesome fun and addicting. i love playing it and . play it all day every day.
A10ZOO9D0QYX5L B009UX2YAC 5 1371427200 23 Subway Surfers is a great app thats supper adictive. But it's very, very hard to update and i have to do that frequently.
A10ZOO9D0QYX5L B0080SZ0V8 5 1374969600 37 Let me just start with, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! I literally played it until my kindle died.Great graphics and sound. And i love all the varieties of puzzles. I don't know why anyone wouldn't play this game!!!
A10ZOO9D0QYX5L B00918L02E 5 1356912000 41 I love this app and all those people who are giving it a bad review are just being mean:(! If you're having a problem with it not moving turn your device off for a few minutes the it should work properly!:)
A10ZT9TI8O98K4 B004V6K38I 5 1314748800 37 I didnt like it at first but its hilarious and a lot of fun even though you truly do nothing. Reminds me of something WoW and DnD players would really enjoy. Can't get enough of it! ={D
A10ZT9TI8O98K4 B004UNGZ8Y 1 1313280000 59 There is absolutely no need for something like this. I used to work for US Cellular and the moron regional manager and the store manager decided to make it mandatory to download a task killer onto androids and I can nearly guarantee that every single one over 2.0 came back with some kind of issue a few weeks later.
A10ZT9TI8O98K4 B0062P7SSY 1 1322697600 26 Force restarts LG Vortex on install..looks awesome i hope the issue gets fixed so i can play. I'll check back in a week or so =\
A10ZT9TI8O98K4 B004KU5LHS 5 1315180800 41 I used this for a while on my blackberry (i think) and it has major improvements. i was using ovuview which was too messy, confusing and wrong. this caught on right away when i put my ovuview info in. looove it.
A10ZT9TI8O98K4 B005F11PEY 3 1312416000 35 Power cycles my phone on install. LG Vortex. Will review better when fixed. Ive played the game on a friends phone before so i know its fun, just want it on my phone now lol
A10ZVVVGDWVZKU B00A04F8NU 5 1354406400 23 Fun game that moved along nicely. There was enough challenge to keep me interested but didn't burn my eyes out. Enjoyed very much!
A10ZVVVGDWVZKU B009WJNXAE 5 1353715200 24 I play this game on my computer at home - one of my favorites! I was so excited to find it on my kindle!
A10ZVVVGDWVZKU B00702PZME 5 1353196800 26 Easy to learn.... hard to put down! I started to play this for the first time today.... can't seem to get anything else done now! LOL!
A10ZVVVGDWVZKU B0085P2Z6E 5 1356220800 49 I forget time when I play this game which is a very nice perk for me :) Definitely not difficult but I find it quite amusing and engaging. It is very easy to zoom in with the kindle fire...not sure why some of the other reviewers complained...love this game!
A10ZW4WFJTYU4F B00CTQ6SIG 5 1400716800 38 I love this game! It is so addictive. I find myself waking up in the middle of the night just to collect the money from the neighbors, houses and buildings. What can I say, the app is awesome!
A10ZW4WFJTYU4F B00CWY76CC 4 1373846400 23 Challenging but doable.  I like the puzzles with multi search areas best.  Great way to pass time while waiting in my doc's office.
A10ZW4WFJTYU4F B00CO6TOBY 5 1375747200 49 Tetris has always been a favorite of mine and this version gets a big thumbs up from me.  Time just flies when playing this and I almost can't bear to put it down.  I make sure never to play this at work...I would get into so much trouble :)
A10ZW4WFJTYU4F B007ZGO7EM 5 1352937600 30 Easy to use and doesn't scrimp on functions.  Love the big bold view and buttons.  This calculator should be apart of the basic set of APPS on the Kindle Fire.
A10ZWDYNT892JX B00FAI2IUM 1 1392076800 41 I play asphalt six all the time. I never upgraded to asphalt 7 or 8, and when i downloaded i was expecting something like asphalt six just better, with more cars, crashes, and explosions. the game really let me down. :(
A10ZWDYNT892JX B006OC2ANS 5 1334448000 23 this game is so awesome I really enjoy the fighting the blood and winning tournamentswhen I win I get a lot of money
A10ZWQB2HCJ88K B006GG1KOC 4 1326326400 208 First off...I am quite frustrated with this I/Me society that we are living in. Rating a free app a one star just because you cant use it or don't get anything out of it is ridiculous! Shame on all of you for being so selfish! Amazon is doing a great thing by offering free apps to all different ages and interests. Great job Amazon!  Now for the real reason for doing a review (which I should spell out for some of you-obviously-is to actually rate the game for info for others to decide if this might be a good app for them). I enjoyed the game and my daughter does also. I agree there should be an explanation for why certain things don't belong, because I wasn't sure in some myself. That would help us parents be able to explain to our children why they may have gotten the wrong answer. But that's the only thing I believe could be improved upon. And to the person who insulted all parents who let their kids play on their phones/kindles etc...many parents download educational apps to do with their child. So please don't insult people that you don't know just because you aren't happy about the app of the day.
A10ZWQB2HCJ88K B008171UVM 4 1337817600 26 Hey...pretty good game. Still trying to learn all the ropes so anyone that can give me tips would be much appreciated! :) Add me 608-079-925. Thx.
A10ZWQB2HCJ88K B0080IOHLW 4 1337126400 44 I really enjoy this game. Pretty fun...just wish it didn't take so many coins to upgrade the elevator because once you have a lot of floors there isn't enough time to complete the quests given by the princess so you lose the bonus pride.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B00FAPF5U0 5 1401753600 37 Love this game. Met a lady about 63 and I was playing this game and she said she loves playing tgis game she called it sugar crush ha ha but what the heck its all fun right.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B0095MVOMC 4 1367193600 34 I've completed this game but I go back and reset it and play some more, I just enjoy the game and it gives me a nice mental challenge every time, good for the brain.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B00F8H0LM2 5 1388620800 97 I have always loved playing Angry Birds, but this one Star Wars !! has me laughing my but off. They really did a great job with this one. I can't believe it was free, some times you get it free and then later it ask if you want to buy the full version, but so far it hasn't asked me that and if it does I won't pay for the full version the free app gives me enough play time, but if I do find myself wanting more I won't have a problem paying for this game.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B0097EWK3A 5 1397433600 37 Enjoyed this game. Can't wait until the next one comes out. I don't mind paying 2.99 for this game. Where else can you get 3.00 worth of great intertainment for about 5 to 6 hours of fun.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B00HG3VFYO 2 1398988800 135 Well the first thing was that it said it was free like most game apps are, you get it and try it out and then if you like it and want it you pay to unlock it, but this game doesn't do that after it is loaded you have to buy it right then and now to even play it. I bought it because fish games are always fun and interesting to play, this one however is a bit dumb and dialog sucks and the hidden object games could of been a lot better. I would say I am a bit sadden that I bought this game all together. But please don't let that stop you from getting it if you want, besides just because I didn't like it very much doesn't mean you won't.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B00HJ4G1MQ 5 1395014400 21 I just wished that it didn't take so long for the next Siren's call to take so long to be made.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B008O661PK 5 1348704000 65 Loved the first game and loved this one as much. I enjoy games like this very much, I can't wait for there to be a 3rd part or more games like this one. I played it once both games and find myself making up a new player name and play it all over again a few more times, it does not get old just fun.ThanksLynn
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B00DWJBOI8 5 1375056000 21 Had a blast playing this game. Wish it would of went on longer. The game was very interesting. I want more.
A10ZYL8EJ4PI9X B00J206J5E 5 1400716800 22 different then most g5e games I've played but nice just the same. I had no problems playing on my kindle fire .
A1100C3R2540RS B004FOA84A 4 1330128000 30 This game is worth the 99 cents you pay for it. Yes it is short, but given the size of the file, you wouldn't want it to be any longer.
A1100C3R2540RS B004ALVL6W 1 1331424000 32 Touch response is nonexistent. Instructions are very little help. Good thing I got it as a free app, I would be demanding my money back with how much this game normally costs.
A1100C3R2540RS B005Z4BGY0 2 1332374400 23 this would be a game that I would really like if the 2nd puzzle didn't glitch up.fix it and I will be happy.
A11022OXR7JFOG B0064X7FVE 5 1392249600 49 I just downloaded the app for the weather channel for android.  I put in my locations got it all set up and the weather is correct in my location I'm so happy that I have the weather Channel! Got to love it! Highly recommended no matter where you live!!
A110346KD4UYN3 B006U52MQY 5 1327708800 54 Omg i love this game its challenging, fun, and cut all packed into one amazing game!  i love that their arte virtually no adds and runs smoothly on my kindle fire. if your looking for a great game anytime, this should b ur first stop :D LOVE IT ITS HE BEST.

A110346KD4UYN3 B004SJ3AXI 3 1327708800 68 same as angry birds with a bit more annoyinglevels if u like angry birds but r looking for more levels this is your ticket. i think the year of he dragon was ok. to much crap in Xmas one halloween had wayyyy to much candy, but the levels r fine i guess I'm not a big angry birds fan bit occasionally it can b fun :) ~ lauren
A110346KD4UYN3 B004SJ3BCI 3 1327708800 27 um, I'm not really a huge fan if angry birds, but sometimes it can b reallly fun :) had to reach 20 word min so cool game
A110346KD4UYN3 B006S3HN6C 5 1328313600 50 This game is very glitchy. The arrows get stuck at he bottom of the screen and sort of vibrate, and the up and down arrows are not lined up. AND, worst of all the buttons don't respond to my finger so its immmmmmmmmposssible to play!  Overall i was disappointed. );
A110346KD4UYN3 B005UQ9FNC 5 1325894400 51 super cute and fun. I play it allll the time I.love that you can breed birds to sell them and I love some.of the prettttty colors and that you.can.get easy points I don't have to work to hard which is awesome. love it on my kindle fire! GET THIS GAME! :)
A110346KD4UYN3 B0063IH60K 5 1325462400 29 its a good game if ya love solitaire(which I dont) wish it had cooler card backs and backgrounds. but otherwise it was just solitaire no glitches or loading problems
A110346KD4UYN3 B00769WNK8 4 1330819200 32 i love the game. the controls r super easy, but there's one thing. MY EYES CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!  it starts going so fast it makes ur eyes hurt. otherwise great game!
A110346KD4UYN3 B006QCMPWM 4 1326844800 49 its super fricken awesome and I absolutely. looooooove it. I have a.different game by the same.creators, and its called BIRD LAND if u liked this game you'll loooooove bird land. its the same.concept. but you feed and breed cute lil BiRdIeS adorable games and GeT bIrDlAnD!!!!!! and ffffaaasssttt :)))
A110346KD4UYN3 B004N371CK 5 1328400000 33 i am in LOVE with this game. its like paper toss but wayyyyy better!  I'm playing this during the SUPER BOWL!  GO PATRIOTS!  Haha well u should totally get this :) I'm addicted!!!
A110346KD4UYN3 B004O9G750 4 1325376000 40 its a fum game! Great to do when I'm bored and / or have nothing better to do. It's easy enough that I can play it fast and its entertaining. Great to get if you have time on your hands!;)
A1103OMW4J98DZ B005UQ9FNC 5 1324944000 25 I love to play this game. I think everyone should have this game on their iPad,Kindle, or Nook. This should be everywhere. Including the news.
A1103OMW4J98DZ B007Z4AKQI 5 1337817600 22 I love this game. My moms boyfriend and I will always compete. He usually wins though. But I still love this game.
A1103OMW4J98DZ B005EYWT38 5 1343088000 20 I love this app!!! It works perfectly, ever since I got it I can sleep like a baby again!!! Finally.
A1103OMW4J98DZ B00COVCV50 5 1372550400 27 Like that u see all the pica all at once.  Although the first one was harder than later ones so don't get frustrated just use the brain.
A1105EQ0T5KDB5 B009LFGG76 3 1395878400 61 NOT A FIVE STAR APP BUT GOOD AND ENJOYABLE.  I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SELECT THE WORD EITHER WAY INSTEAD OF JUST FROM THE BEGINNING...BUT THAT'S JUST A PERSONAL PREFERENCE. IT WOULD BE NICE IF  I COULD CHANGE THE SETTINGS TO REMOVE THE TIMER. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO FIND A WORD SEARCH THAT HAD THE TWISTED WORD SEARCH.
A1105EQ0T5KDB5 B00CZDSK7K 1 1380067200 23 Tried it on a lark...pointless, slow, stupid. Went through the tutorial and played it for 15 minutes...then deleted it. Glad it was free.
A1105EQ0T5KDB5 B004SUWR2C 1 1373155200 44 Just  downloaded and went to open and play....so excited. First thing it tells me off that the app requires an additional 98MB of space to work/play....say what?!?! For me, not impressed. Taking my 99 coinloss and deleting the app. VERY disappointed at the deception.
A1105EQ0T5KDB5 B006QMYF0W 3 1380067200 30 Better than some. Getting used to the quirks...I do like the auto-complete. Seems to work well. I will have to play it more to see if it gets to stay.
A1105EQ0T5KDB5 B006P2Y2QK 3 1380067200 29 I like it better than those that are throwing ads up after every game. The auto-complete is very nice and the statistic counter can be entertaining to challenge yourself.
A1108OHB1MXU17 B00BMAHA9Q 5 1365984000 53 I started with Predators; this is an incredible upgrade! Play the levels over again to get the hang of the controls and to earn your points for the upgrades.  A very fun game and worth the money. Every time I play I enjoy it moreand more. 5 stars total and worth the money!!
A1108OHB1MXU17 B009LQ8X58 5 1370995200 20 Honestly, so far so good. Thank you Android Wax.  Have noticed a difference in speed. And performance. So far. Thanks.
A1108OHB1MXU17 B00HWD2OE8 5 1393286400 36 This game is great. Knowing that u have to complete missions according to Energy consumption, this game does well. Take a break and come back to. And again. Enjoy and work the game for a while...
A110CYS5LJJCG6 B005V1N71W 1 1354060800 87 at first it would not shut off, had to shut down my kindle and restart to have pandora off. that was fixed(majic) but now it will go thru a whole song without making any sound come out of my kindle, unles you pause and un pause, sometimes more than once.  i have been using pandira on my blackberry for years without any of these problems. was gonna buy pandora one, but not with the way its acting. i uninstalled and reinstalled, this is your last chance pandora......
A110CYS5LJJCG6 B004W7Z14W 1 1353628800 97 I have a heart condition and it is super important for me to keep notes of my blood pressure, weight, heart rate, and sodium intake for each day.  I WAS in love with this app until it deletes almost a month of my notes, and there is no way to get them back.  I would absolutely not recomend this app or any othr apps from galleryapp, they clearly are a crap company.  sevierely pissed and now have to sxplain to my doc why i lost all that info! should be ashamed of yourselfs putting out this app!
A110DQ529C7MHG B008Y2FRFO 5 1349654400 27 love this game so glad I'm not losing my real money. lol!! it is so much fun trying to unlock tbd other games by getting puzzle pieces.
A110DQ529C7MHG B0080IOHLW 5 1337472000 39 I got this game for my kids mostly, but I ended up playing it more it'd like a cheep version of Sims and just as fun accept its more adorable, lol!! it really is a very addicting game tho.
A110EWFIXLN2LO B0087TQYUG 5 1362441600 41 like this game a lot and unlike &quot;hanging&quot; &amp; &quot;words&quot; I don't think there is a &quot;cheat&quot;.... it's fun and a great way to learn new words... also like the way it gives you the full list of words once completed..
A110EWFIXLN2LO B007XKEY6Q 2 1337385600 52 love this game but like others have said after awhile it just decides it doesn't want to open on my Kindle Fire. the first time it did it I uninstalled and reinstalled the app but in doing so lost all my Colors coins and even my screen name. very sad : (
A110EWFIXLN2LO B004MC8CA2 5 1339027200 39 this app has so many reading plans and subjects that there is just no excuse for not reading or participating in a daily devotional. so easy to use and spend time in at least once a day.  love it
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00CH26TL8 5 1400716800 41 I really love it. it starts out slow like a lot of games but as you go along it harder. you really have to think a little bit before you shot. like shotting pool you think a move ahead of time.
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00CWY76CC 5 1377129600 31 It was great you really had to think a little on some of the rooms but I got through.  I love it please get some more.. fast!!  I can not wait.
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00E8KLWB4 5 1389571200 22 I am still learning the game so far it.. is interesting.  I give 5stars.  It is definitely different you should try it.
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00G5LQ5MU 5 1394668800 29 What a game. I loved the movie and I love this game . I like that you have to solve your way at of danger.l give it five stars.
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00HCMG6LG 5 1395273600 27 I really love this game. It make you think and that's good for your brain.it's as good if not better then the first game.you should try it.
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00CMF27DE 5 1371427200 20 it's fun, you get bingo alot and the kittens are cute.i could play for hours and not get bored, sweat
A110IQJ86GCQJR B00FAPF5U0 5 1387324800 20 I love, I love, I love. It is great every spare moment I have I play. Every one should play.
A110KV2T5LVMRD B007MPJQ38 3 1364083200 297 This game was entertaining while it lasted which wasn't long in my opinion. I tried playing it a second time to see what would happen if I picked differently at the end but it only took me maybe 15 minutes to get through it since I already knew exactly what to do and the change of choice didn't make a difference really.  It was fun and somewhat challenging the first time through and I'll admit a couple of spots had me stumped for a minute or two but in a fun way not so bad as to want to give up. I think this game is probably much better for kids they would probably have more fun and I'm sure it would last longer for them because as I said some parts were challenging for me so they may even need a little help depending on their age. I don't want people to think that I'm saying the game was simple either, some parts towards the beginning were fairly easy but not so simple that it's not fun and as it goes on it seems to get a little harder but not too much that you won't want to play, some parts will have you stumped then when you figure it out you laugh at yourself for not getting it sooner. Overall I'd say that it is entertaining, kids will enjoy it, it didn't have any glitches or freeze at all on my kindle fire hd 8.9, had decent picture quality and smooth game play. Not bad at all for the $.99 I paid I'd say it was worth that just don't expect to play it again unless you wait a very long time or forget easily. I also think they could have made the ending better.
A110KV2T5LVMRD B00C7TAF3Y 4 1370390400 154 I enjoyed playing this game.It was just what I've been looking for a challenging game that makes you think.I enjoyed the graphics as well and I had no problems with glitches or download or anything on my kindle fire hd. I would have given it five stars if it were a little longer, but overall I'd give it 4.5stars.I look forward to more games like this from fireproof games, I can't wait. It definitely took me a little longer by not using hints like another reviewer suggested. A few times it had me stumped but when I finally figured out what it was that I hadn't tried I was like &#34;duh why didn't I try that before?&#34; But it only added to my enjoyment and I didn't find anything that was impossible to get. Thank you for finally making a challenging game that will keep adults on their toes and coming back for more.
A110KV2T5LVMRD B0055SWM08 5 1372204800 217 This game is fun and addictive.I like that it's not too easy but still challenging enough to make you think and have fun.the only problem I had is it wouldn't let me play it off line but I'm hoping that was only because I hadn't opened it right away after I downloaded it and that since I got online and played with it that next time it'll let me play without being connected.I also like that even after you completed a level you can return to it later to beat you score and get trophies( there are plenty of trophies to work towards too). I was worried when I seen that you could buy coins only because I don't really like having to buy coins to play a game but I haven't had to purchase any and you earn them easily by playing. As far as I've seen there's no need to purchase coins but if you want to you can to get levels unlocked b4 finishing the previous levels. This is not a problem for me because I like working my way through but if I do get stuck I have earned enough coins through gameplay to move on so as not to get frustrated by having to play that level over and over I guess.
A110KV2T5LVMRD B00IEBE7GK 5 1396656000 110 I love this game I'm so glad they made a second one. I like that it's a game that actually challenges you and makes you think about what you need to do. Also if you get stuck there are hints that help you along. I would love for fireproof games to make more games like this. Awesome graphics too. I have a kindle fire hd and have had no issues or glitches or anything while playing this game, when I first started playing I thought it was going to freeze up during the loading process because the clock stopped but after a few seconds it finished loading on its own.
A110KV2T5LVMRD B00FN7K8Z2 4 1398038400 523 I was a little wary about buying this game because of the reviews saying it doesn't save your progress but I'm glad I did.I loved the dog theme throughout, the artwork was beautiful and I had no problems with the main game saving my progress(although I was prepared), and the story seemed well thought out and original. I am playing on a kindle fire hd and all the items worked and the hints helped point you in the right direction when needed. Now you probably wonder why 4stars instead of 5, well I'll tell you. I started the bonus chapter late last night and was really into it liking what I was seeing but I was tired soI figured well so far it has saved fine so I quit and went to bed. This morning I couldn't wait to get back into it and again told myself I could have to start the bonus chapter over because some reviews mentioned that might happen, if so whatever I wasn't that far into it so no biggie. Well I was pleasantly surprised to see I was only one scene behind where I left off, cool no problems until I try to get my flint to burn the roots in my way like I did last night and the flint is gone what?!? Ok so I go searching around maybe it's back where I originally picked it up? No it's no where to be found, now I'm getting irritated I can't play any further because I need it to get past the roots darn. I kinda wish it would've just started me back at the beginning of the bonus chapter because at least then I could do everything over again and get past that part. Overall though it was a very fun and beautiful game, it did run a little slower than most the games I've played and I had to double tap on some items to pick them up but I still enjoyed playing and I really did love the story. I am going to try choosing global progress instead of local and see if that helps, it's the first time I've ever seen this before a game also and I'm not quite sure what or why it's there , obviously there are differences because that is what it says but I just don't get why it asks every time I open the game. Anyway if it changes anything I will edit my review. If not I will probably just play the game again and not start the bonus until I have plenty of time to finish it lol. Overall I am still happy I purchased the game, I wish it would've been a little cheaper than$2.99 because of the problems but I guess they do charge a lot for collectors editions so they probably figure it is discounted. I hope this helps anyone deciding to get this game, if you are willing to be patient and know the risks going in , it is a very fun game and isn't too difficult on casual but isn't simple either, also there are three difficulty levels.
A110KV2T5LVMRD B00B2V66VS 5 1389312000 43 I can play this game a hundred times a day and still want to play tomorrow to try to get more upgrades,trophies,and a higher score. For free you can't go wrong with this app, you have entertainment at the touch of the screen.
A110NYYIVQ0C2P B00E5GJ7QS 4 1402876800 43 I love bingo. I could play this game for hours, and I have, haha. The only thing I don't like about this game is, it's hard to win bingo credits. But then if it was easy it would not be a challenge. Haha!!!!!2
A110NYYIVQ0C2P B00GXH3TGG 5 1393113600 33 This is a very entertaining game. Takes a long time to run out of chips. If you like a game that you can play for hours then this is the game for you.
A110NYYIVQ0C2P B00CEBKMN8 5 1392249600 21 I really like this game. I would give it 5 stars. I play it all the time, it can be addictive
A110NYYIVQ0C2P B008JGSM6G 5 1393286400 30 Hours and hours of fun. Very addictive. It is a very challenging and hours of fun. I have to play when I get up and before I go to bed.

A110SHSXZKNJQ6 B007581DPQ 5 1361836800 28 I thought 23 month old would like this app, but he doesnt! Its Just like watching an episode if veggie tales. No interaction! Will keep trying it tho!
A110TMG21M1PVO B004ZALKMI 1 1326412800 35 this is the worst app ever. I thought this would be fun well I sure was wrong. I dint Even know what it does. it just sits there smiling and rolling its eyes at you!!!!!!!!!

A110TMG21M1PVO B005X9498M 3 1334361600 22 I think its kinda kool but its a little to unbelievable cause my kindle fire is to big for a iphone 4s
A110TMG21M1PVO B00689PMD2 4 1326844800 29 this game is super fun and sooooo addicting!!! but in order for me to move up I have to pay money!!! they want to much money for just amusement!!!
A110TMG21M1PVO B004UBH4S6 3 1334275200 20 it's pretty good but its not all that fun to me. I love horoscopes but I'm just not feeling it.
A110YD5QO9IIV0 B006RA13BW 4 1333411200 21 Blow up balloons and pop them.  4yo loves it and its a dollar.  Adults will enjoy for a couple minutes only.
A1111YA1YQWNYQ B00CAK052Q 5 1377129600 35 It's awesome and I like it because it has lava landing platforms . It also has cool cars and if you like it or rate it you can get a free car in  the game.:)
A1113A2Y0AOCCW B00CKW6FVE 1 1397692800 28 Yet again, another app designed specifically to persuade us to give up our dollars in order to use the free app...not me, thank you very much...deleted from device...
A1113A2Y0AOCCW B00GCI69D6 5 1390867200 27 I won't repeat all the comments about the hidden controls but once discovered this is a lovely application.....  remarkable after enduring the junk that is out there.
A1113A2Y0AOCCW B0064X7FVE 2 1384646400 34 This app is almost useless.  The radar feature rarely loads and if it finally does load there is no information visible.  This app was installed on a Kindle Fire 7 HD...  Goodbye Weather Channel...
A1114R791RTPXM B0086700CM 5 1356652800 30 I get so into the game that every time I have to jump.. that I end up kicking my leg up and end up cracking up cause I did that!!!!!
A1114R791RTPXM B00A757EFW 3 1359504000 21 Brings back fond memories!!! Too Bad that advertisements always pop up when you want to play... Otherwise It's Still A Classic!!!
A1114R791RTPXM B005HSL626 5 1365638400 37 Love It!!!For when I'm in the mood to be all Ninja Style!!! You get so into the game that you don't even realize that you have been playing for at least an hour!!!This Rocks!!!! and Very Addicting!!!!!
A1114R791RTPXM B009PCBEPE 5 1359504000 26 Simple but Effective!!!! I Dare You to try and see if you can hit all the Zombies in One Shot!!! If Not... Let's Try in Two!!!
A1116NBCQB2VU5 B0088QDDDY 4 1348617600 29 It's not bad, but very short. The controls are both simple and responsive, the puzzles all make sense, it would just be a bit better if it were longer.
A1116NBCQB2VU5 B0054JZC6E 4 1344556800 23 I don't have any problems with it. The little games keep me busy, and the more I play, the more I can...Well,  play.
A1116NBCQB2VU5 B004MC8CA2 2 1346630400 138 This Bible app used to work perfectly fine for me, but I would recommend using a &quot;real&quot; Bible because last I checked, paper doesn't have glitches or requires a wifi connection.True, it boasts more translations of the Bible than I thought there even were, and it has an easy method of quickly moving to which verses you need to get to, but it has its problems.For one, you need a YouVersion account just to download any of the translations. This isn't really a big deal, just a little inconvenience, so if you choose not to sign up it requires a wifi connection. Also, as I read I noticed random letters and numbers jumbled incoherently in the text, like typos. Finally, it became unusable, as when I look up a verse, completely random and unrelated verses are listed instead.
A1116NBCQB2VU5 B0086700CM 4 1344816000 35 I was discouraged to get this because it seemed like it might be the same thing over and over.It is.And yet I keep coming back and playing. It is pretty addicting, I have to admit.
A1116NBCQB2VU5 B0052AZJV8 5 1344038400 54 It works, and it works well. I use it for Skype and Steam, though Steam can make your list of contacts fairly jumbled and disorganized, so I don't use it unless I have a reason.Skype however works brilliantly, it's so effective I can talk with my Kindle and watch the conversation on my computer.
A1116NBCQB2VU5 B005V1N71W 5 1348531200 85 There's a lot of reviews saying that this Pandora app has some issues, but I personally have found absolutely none (Fix your device?)This app allows you to listen to music that resembles a song or artist, and often the artist itself, with a few commercials between songs.Sometimes I might get a completely random artist, but those can be 'banned' on the station, unfortunately you can't be rid of an entire artist, only a song.From what I've experienced, this is an app that must be had.
A111AFP4PMXU8F B0054JZC6E 4 1335571200 31 i love this game! you start off with a few games and you have to &quot;complete&quot; the games to get more points and wih those points you can unlock new games
A111AFP4PMXU8F B00DOIBYYG 5 1388793600 63 Well, I have seen many negative reviews (more like all negative reviews) but after trying this app out, I feel the problems are either fixed or I have one Awesome kindle! But unlike the previous reviews, the app does not freeze or slow. The videos load very fast and it has not affected any of my other apps. I definitely recommend this app!
A111AFP4PMXU8F B00689PMD2 4 1353542400 80 i love this app. i could get off of it. people who say first of all that it shuts your kindle fire down, all u have to do is hold down the power button for 20 min.also, some other people say they do not tell u about using real money, but they do!! they use dollar signs AND ask how u r going to pay, so those people who got a refund cheated amazon.all in all,  a very good game.

A111CSAB9KUP7V B004ANMWPY 5 1379808000 133 Thanks Amazon. When I updated my PC to Windows8, I lost my Charter cablechannel tv guide app on my Kindle Fire and PC. it was really a struggle to get the channel guide and I didn't want to pay the $5 graft addition to Charter cable for the box to get the guide. Thus I found this app for my Kindle Fire TV Listings for Android which enables me to check the local cable channel guide while I am viewing my TV. Maybe small thing to others but a big deal for me since I like the basics. Thanks a ton! Amazon. If you are like me with extended basic cable and don't have the box to let you know what is on TV this is a must have for your android device.
A111CSAB9KUP7V B0063M22QO 3 1378512000 118 The Kindle Tablet Edition of Mahjong is a okay app. I was looking for a mahjong game app to take with me on the go. The price was right and since the mahjong app was made for the Kindle thought I'd try it. It is responsive and the play is okay but I really did like the graphics of the free app I had the first 2 years on my Kindle Fire. Something happened to the app the colors corrupted so I needed another app. Thought this one would be better since I had to pay for it, but not great does the function gives me something to do at the doctor's office, or waiting in the mall.
A111CSAB9KUP7V B008K6HN8I 5 1356998400 96 The ES File Explorer is working great! I didn't know about this app til I read the &#34;Mastering the Kindle&#34; ebook (free). It is a fantastic addition to my Kindle Fire 2d Edition for transferring Microsoft Word & Excel documents and finding them quickly on the device. Before it seems so cumbersome a experience. Now this are organized and there's file folders already that exist you can use. If you just got your Fire or have one already I recommend this app (free) that will cut the headache out of file management within the Fire environment.
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B008FC58ES 5 1369958400 24 This game is addicting! Really enjoying going through different players. They get better quick! Best free game I've played in a long time! :)
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00AA87JGU 4 1356220800 21 good game so far! like the idea and it can be tough! like all others said too much asking for money...
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00DRHY8EW 4 1377388800 40 This game is mostly HO which I love. Great graphics, not too much story - this is simple relaxation :) I would have rated 5 stars except no map. Good strategy guide. Well worth the $2.99 for the full game!
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00J4YTRP2 4 1398297600 27 Played the first of this series and enjoyed it. This one is just as good. Few glitches here and there but nothing that alters game play. Recommended.
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00AIQP9DE 3 1357862400 29 Graphics and story are well done. But gameplay too easy to justify paying for it. Best G5 I've tried. I tend to be more a big fish fan :)
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00HG3VFYO 5 1388620800 51 So happy to have this great Big Fish game! Unlocked full version. Well worth 2.99! Lots of point and click. Lots of fun HO' s and mini games. Not too much chatter, which can really annoy me... Love that a map is included bc I get lost a lot :) Thx!
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00AKJRPC2 4 1356912000 61 This is a good one! Love the graphics and the story is great for adults. Lots of fun HO scenes and the mini-puzzles are just hard enough. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is b/c I always want a good map and this game has none. Overall awesome game big fish! More like this please. Worth the 2.99 :)
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00G5LQ5MU 3 1384732800 39 As with so many games I feel I must rate (this time to get hint) before I know if I like it or not. So I'm rating. I give it a benign not sure yet. Sorry! Not helpful :(
A111GHMLHWD8K8 B00ATDOVNK 5 1368057600 66 This game, while kinda pricey at $4.99, is a lot of fun. The interaction is smooth and the map is my favorite kind. The kind where u can see where you are AND where you need to go next. Not sure why more games don't use that. Anyway! Not too hard and not too easy. Great lazy day off relaxation... Thx G5 for this one! :)
A111HFYKSMNTJP B008L3T37O 3 1359849600 22 While the pictures could be pleasant they seem to be a bit boring and not very challenging to find the hidden objects.
A111HFYKSMNTJP B00GI8AMI8 1 1404777600 6 Too vague. Removed it from device.
A111HFYKSMNTJP B00I5UHKPA 1 1393718400 22 Only half downloaded and would not finish.  Unhappy!  Second thoughts about trying any other games. Wastes the time I have to spend.
A111HFYKSMNTJP B00AE6SS5O 3 1387065600 22 Just a bit too cutesy for an adult but because of all the dialog but still fun.  Less conversation would be better.
A111MBD4R8J32A B0063GSL60 4 1392249600 21 enjoying the Freecell and the combinations you can do with it. Keep up the good work it keeps my mind working.
A111MBD4R8J32A B00ALKKM98 4 1392249600 40 It is a teaser. After playing it so many time you finally get the system of playing it. Lay off of it for a few days and you have to work on figuring it out again. Good for all ages.
A111Q9P8UWHUGJ B00AGOGOLE 1 1392336000 20 Saw that it was a limited offer, so deleted it.  I don't think this camera would be what I needed.
A111Q9P8UWHUGJ B005LJXR6E 4 1392768000 20 I enjoyed the puzzles, but there were not enough of them.  They went to quickly and no more to play.
A111Q9P8UWHUGJ B007OX09MA 5 1395878400 21 I like that I can get such a variety in one place.  You don't have to do a lot of searches.
A111UVAMGRBFWE B009UX2YAC 5 1385856000 20 Just a fun game.  Love it. The Graphics are good also.  All ages will love this game..  Graphics are good.Thanks.
A111UVAMGRBFWE B009O2XY12 5 1385856000 26 A very nice game.  Anyone would love this.  Even youngsters would like this one The Graphics are great.  Lots of fun, keeps you on your toes.
A11201WA8VLRE7 B006OC2ANS 5 1330560000 29 when I star play this game, I am lost in time, I love the game,  the graphics is fantastic, they music and interface too....I give 5star for this game....
A1120SHKX7PHVD B009G9KFQ0 5 1373587200 28 I especially like the alerts for T-storms and flash flood warnings here in New Mexico. It also lets you know how close lightning activity is to your location.
A1121ECZVXBAIM B008Y7SMQU 4 1357257600 20 It is good but some times u get bored in 3 hours. Trust me, that happened to me 3minutes ago.
A1121ECZVXBAIM B009UX2YAC 5 1358121600 28 Since now they have the New York version I am addict to this game. I live in New York so I feel right in home in this game.
A1121ECZVXBAIM B008A07U0U 1 1364169600 93 I am mad. I was about to go to level 18 in the meadow part and they said I need to buy the mega pack to continue this game. That part piss me off. Now I need to delete this game and try to find a better one. If they fix that part I will be happy. But no, then bye bye. Lucky can't escape and he will never see his family again. Then he will be a test monkey forever. I bet u that carrot cake isn't that good.Peace and love funnychocolatebunny&lt;3
A1121ECZVXBAIM B00B2V66VS 5 1359244800 42 Temple run is back baby! But better. Temple run 2 now has awesome features. Temple run use to be fun but when subway surfers came they went down but now since they are back subway surfers are good but temple run good:-)
A1121ECZVXBAIM B00DJFIMW6 5 1373414400 20 I am going to see despicable me 2 on Tuesday so I got this game. So it is awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!bye bye
A1121ECZVXBAIM B00A9NXGAO 4 1360281600 59 I love star girl but last time I downloaded this in my mom's phone it had starchat and everything, but when I downloaded it in my kindle fire it does it have starchat! I don't know what's the problem but if you guys could help me with this problem i will give star girl 5stars. Peace and love.From: Ailey&lt;3
A1121T8UDFTGVH B00E3OUQ5S 5 1376179200 20 It deserves 5 stars because it's great and free,hut the aim is a little hard to use,but it's very nice
A1121WCMI06CJO B0064TVQ5E 5 1324684800 23 This is a great app. The sounds are relaxing, much like the game. The graphics are good. Overall, it's a good app. :)
A1121WCMI06CJO B0066T8M1I 4 1325203200 28 The app works well on the Fire, the graphics are good, it's full of personalizing options for both rules and settings. Overall, it is a good app. :)
A1121WCMI06CJO B0063IH60K 5 1330300800 23 This is a great app, :) I play a couple games of solitaire on this all every night before I go to bed.
A1122DV1NCD8TB B00EHKJ60E 3 1405814400 28 I love this game, but it is expensive, a lot more than it should be. How about getting a free card e daytime you pass a certain level?
A1122DV1NCD8TB B00E5GJ7QS 5 1395792000 28 Enjoyable game. I like it, easy to play. I've played a lot of bingo games lately, and I like the fact four cards are visible at one time.
A1122DV1NCD8TB B00CXBSYVG 5 1397347200 20 Love this game, although at times I wish I had more than one card. But, loved it just the same.
A1122DV1NCD8TB B00E8KLWB4 5 1398729600 33 I enjoy this game a lot. It is fun, challenging and engaging all at the same time.  Curious how I will bbc e able to do each level. A must have for all.
A1122DV1NCD8TB B00JBNS6KS 5 1400112000 26 Love this game.Played the original cubis on the computer years ago, was delighted when it showed up on kindle. I definitely will be purchasing this game.
A1122DV1NCD8TB B00J68TF6W 5 1404345600 20 This game is fun and very addicting. Haven't made it to 2048, but hoping. Please play, and it is free!!
A1126HG390T7XF B004WGGQPQ 5 1369526400 28 Very good game. Lots of expensive stuff In here that is FREE! I love this get it it has stickers, paint brushes, completed pencils, and much more.  :)
A1126HG390T7XF B00AREIAI8 4 1377475200 96 I &lt;3 this game good graphics and nice little activates to do, fun games, and ok challenges. The reason I made it a half star then 5 is due to gems costing real money (you get 1 free one each level and start with 3) the time it takes to load (it has to download then download new stuff once you enter the app) and the fact that, in some parts, it requires you to ask a friend to join the game from Facebook.(Which I don`t have one because you have to be 13, man parents)
A1126HG390T7XF B00CEBO09A 5 1371254400 53 I love it!!!! The other people say &quot;it is not all that great&quot; well I love it!!!! Only one this is that it will get little pop up`s not very often but sometimes, that could be tempting for small kids. It has easy controls and is fun to play, I LOVE it!!!!  :)
A1126HG390T7XF B00B7Y0206 5 1377648000 49 I LOVE this it have commercials when you pause but sensible ones. I can find nothing yet that is bad on it, so I think u should totally get this app.Or else you can just continue to not be able to watch youtube videos...(I have a kindle Fire HD)
A1126HG390T7XF B00AW3FDIO 5 1378080000 25 I like this app due to it not looking half bad, good graphics and nice weapons. Even my brother likes it he &lt;3 it!!!!  :)
A1126HG390T7XF B00H0BGCJK 5 1386979200 25 It's a great game and it has NOTHING with minecraft. I love it and you will too!! Get it and be pulled into the awesome!!
A1126HG390T7XF B00ED4TX2A 5 1394668800 69 This game rocks!! You get to style ur person, fight zombies, join/make groups, hang with friends, buy gear..... sooooo much more 2! Just putting this out there though, a lot of really good things need skulls to buy, which cost real cash. But, you can still do a LOT with things you find and the currency in the game. All in all, a great game, very easy to play!
A1126HG390T7XF B00AECGQF2 5 1383523200 40 I have toca hair salon...... best hair salon game EVER!!!! I am trying to get them all but only have managed to play beta on them all. Anyway great graphics, great choices, wonderful for ALL ages due to easy controls.
A1126HG390T7XF B009UX2YAC 5 1391040000 51 This game is great for ALL ages and is easy to play. Fun 4 u and a lot of other people too. U can challenge friends Veda Facebook, set records for yourself, and get the choice of it character! Lots of fun, should really get it, and will keep u entertained!
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B009UWL580 5 1361404800 24 Wonderful free game with options for upgrading machine as you go.  Can spend money but anyone with a brain would know it is optional.'
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00CO4KGYA 3 1378512000 26 Too repetative boring after just a little while.  I got it free &amp; unistalled it.  I would not pay the $2.99 they are asking for now.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00AZL3PBK 5 1363046400 34 Love this game it reminds me so much of the original mario brothers game.  Fun and you can go back and replay levels to gain lives.... This game is great and it is free.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00A3NQNUU 5 1363046400 58 This is the perfect way to kill some time... Fun game does not require money to play.  If you are patient and use the arena you can level up quickly and earn lots of gems quickly as well.  Fun game and best yet it is free!  Would be great for any age and is a fun little app.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00BGC5UAG 2 1362614400 31 It's a fun game but you are only given 1 free hint then they want you to pay for more.  There are better apps that are actually free.  I unistalled it!
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00AO0JH0K 4 1363046400 29 I would have given it 5 stars but it needs more levels.  It only took me 2hrs to complete these puzzles.  However some of the images are fairly abstract.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00A3E2BVE 3 1363046400 35 Wish it gave you more options in the challenges.  I don't like that if I accept a challege I get whatever catagory it pulls up I wish I could block classical music as a catagory.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B007BUITZU 3 1363046400 32 Super cute images worth having just for those.  Little ones will love this game it is just a click and rotate puzzle so it is well suited to younger puzzlers as well.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B008Y7SMQU 4 1364169600 33 fun quiz could do with a few less airlines but at times it really makes u think.  Gave it 4 stars because level 6 has an extra logo I could find no where!
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B007C8DXQQ 1 1363046400 22 Boring not much to do here. Even though it was free it was boring, I deleted this app 10 min after starting.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B008K3OOJM 1 1363046400 40 Unless you really want to tend an aquarium I would pass on this.  It is all the work of a fishtank without the beauty of real fish.  Not my thing but if you really like fish it would be fun.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B007VUA7VO 5 1380412800 67 I love this app.  For a free battery app this is the best.  It.does not take up a lot of room on your device and does what a battery app should. Additionally there are no adds, it's free, and you can change the battery color.  All that about Kindle Fire is BS because I have had this since June 2013 &amp; my kindle has had no problems.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00BNH1PF8 4 1363564800 31 Irony like that it bribes you to review.  However it does run much better than the first edition.  Hopefully as I play it wont mess up like the first one did!
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00CMF27DE 4 1382313600 37 If you like Cats and Bingo this is the game for you...  Is great because you can earn achievements and play bingo.  With 20 token regeneration daily it is easy for them to accumulate.,  Love this game!
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00EBE8MUG 3 1378512000 46 I got through the first twenty or so levels &amp; it just got boring.  Not to mention if you need assistance you have few options after you use your game money.  It takes forever to earn and hints cost a mint and are not that helpful.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B0060D80NU 4 1363046400 29 A fun time waster.... Building the island is fun.  Leveling up can take a bit of time but with each level brings more options.  Good for a free game.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B0084HDG8Y 1 1363046400 31 Free download not so much.  You can download free trials that are good for one play and then you are asked to buy the table.  How this could get really pricey!
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B00CC59H8W 5 1372291200 29 Loads of fun for all ages!  There is something satisf ying about blowing up evil Teddy bears.  Plus it was a free app so it is worth the download.
A112CRVJ2SPRWD B009C7ZQM4 5 1363046400 20 I can't believe this is a free app.  It is wonderful and helped clean the garbage files off my Kindle.
A112DRL7TW7YTH B00KWVZ750 5 1404259200 12 Fun,fun,fun. My nephew has been waiting for the next Star Wars Epic
A112DRL7TW7YTH B008QZ1ZYQ 5 1385337600 24 High qualily with true to size fit. The color and length were perfect and I loved the fabric.  It was m ice and thick
A112DUGAK9ZI56 B006M5A75K 2 1324512000 47 3 row without a vowel at the start of the game? means the letters are truly random which makes this a game of luck as much as spelling skills. there are much better and consistent letter game out there. glad I didn't pay anything for it. uninstalling.
A112DUGAK9ZI56 B004O3YGMC 2 1325808000 25 requires special software to be installed on the computer.  this should be made obvious in the product description.I expected this to be an RDC client.
A112DUGAK9ZI56 B004OZOTSQ 2 1334361600 124 I was hoping this app would provide an interface similar to using windows explorer over a USB cable (albeit using a browser and wifi). Unfortunately there is no way to autodiscover the phone, so you have to enter the ip address and port in the browser. Then the program claims the ability to upload entire directories, which I was interested since I listen to a lot of audiobooks that are in their own directory. It turns out you have to zip the directory, upload it and unzip it on the phone. that's still too awkward. For now I'll stick to using a cable, it's 1000% more convenient than dealing wih the limitation of the interface over a browser for the sake of being wireless.
A112DUGAK9ZI56 B004V1XJ6Q 3 1368921600 226 I installed aldiko to replace FBreader that I had been using previously because of its good reviews and the fact that in had understood aldiko could synchronize the current page between multiple devices (I sometimes read on my tablet, sometimes on my phone).It turns out sync across devices is not supported. There is an3rd party app for pay, but it's clunky and a similar one exists for FBreader.It did give me a chance to form an opinion on aldiko though:It remembers the last page in each book, but doesn't automatically opens the last book you read, so instead of being able to read as soon as you open the app, you first need to select the book you want to read. Sine 99.9% of the time in want to read the book I was reading last, I find it very annoying.The whole program feels sluggish: the page turn animation is too slow and not adjustable.Swipe to turn a page doesn't always register. I got so annoyed I started using tap to turn instead,  it I sometimes accidentally tap and turn the page when I didn't mean to. That is also why I left page turn animation on even though it is too slow.All in all I am going back to FBreader: more responsive, opens your last book to then right page, more options, more supported formats.
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B005XQLBU4 5 1377302400 25 .Find is fun fast little game. Playing on Kindle Fire 8.9 no sign of malware yet. It is very similar to the old missile command
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B00B7Y0206 1 1390780800 169 This is another case of Amazon refusing to give customers the best app available. Google has an excellent YouTube app on its Playstore. This app is a mess. It will play ok but if you try to open channels or access subscriptions it is impossible UNLESS you give these V tube developers access to everything. The adds are barely tolerable. I still tried to sign in and it does not load. I am an Amazon fan and big User but I am getting tired of the limited access to apps. There are many apps such as my bank app that I can get on the app store but not Amazon. There are very few local news apps and I live in Washington D.C. (???) But almost every outlet is on the playstore. I love my Kindle (I have brought four. One of each generation) but I find myself having to go to my old Toshiba tablet or phone to access info I would prefer to use my Kindle for.
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B00DJFIMW6 1 1372809600 25 Will not finish loading on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 , my grandsons Kindle Fire or a Toshiba tablet. Definitely something wrong with the app!!
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B00AFCEIB0 1 1403654400 47 This suddenly replaced Google search on my kindle HD. I do not want a new search engine. I prefer Google.... I trust Google more than Bing and others I have tried. Did Amazon remove Google? if so please give your customers the courtesy of notice and explanation.
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B009C7ZQM4 4 1388620800 90 I use it very often to speed up my Kindle Fire and keep it running. There is an option that that stays in the memory and monitors memory. Do not activate. It uses more memory than it is worth. A great feature is the app manager. It tells you when you last used an app and is an easy-to-use uninstaller. I am deleting one stars because the app is becoming too obtrusive. In fact I am sure it is using as much memory as other apps. It is still useful.
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B00AESN8XY 5 1391472000 23 Very engrossing game play. It move at a fast pace and makes you think about the vulnerability of the world we live in.
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B0093QQAEM 4 1392336000 49 It works well. Playback is excellent and the download is fast and easy to find if you read instructions. I have kindle HD and I will try it on my grandsons 1st generation kindle. Four stars is only because of small collection but it is well worth 99 cents
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B0063IH60K 1 1386288000 51 The game has good play value. I had it for a long time. But the advertising has become intolerable! They are often LOUD and obnoxious. The ads are designed so that you have to hunt and search how to stop for each one. ONLY GET THIS GAME IF YOU LOVE ADVERTISING
A112GI8CIS9ZJ8 B009LQ8X58 5 1373932800 43 I just installed on an old Toshiba thrive tablet and my Kindle Fire 8.9 it really worked well both are noticeably faster. I had stopped using the Thrive tablet because it was too slow now it is as fast as it was new
A112GUIE36G8DZ B00A6GNC1M 4 1358899200 21 I love playing this game. I like to play bingo a lot so I gave it a try and liked it.
A112GUIE36G8DZ B008LXN9II 5 1354147200 20 Not only do my grand children love playing this game but so do I.  We just love playing this game....
A112GUIE36G8DZ B009RAQGLG 5 1354147200 31 I love playing hidden object games and this one is really good. I really like the music and picture graphic. I think it's cool how the ghost appears and dis appears.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B00BNH1PF8 4 1364601600 42 Very challenging at times.  Downloaded it because my Mom is rehabilitating from a back surgery so I need some good time consuming games.  The nurse said that lots of people are addicted to it that are in the same wing as here.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B006OBWGHO 5 1347580800 37 Love the challenge!  Some seem impossible at times, but then you realise what you need to do to finally solve it!!!  So Much FUN!!!  Only drawback is you could spend hours playing before you know it!!!! ;O
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B007ZGO7EM 5 1349049600 37 Mostly I use it for balancing my check book.  But I didn't expect it to have all the functions, memory buttons are very helpful!  Plus I love the fact it does percentages too!  THANK YOU Digitalchemy, LLC!!!!
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B009UX2YAC 5 1361923200 50 Subway Surfer is so addicting!  It can be really easy one time then almost impossible to get very far at all the next.  Really challenging and I love the different goals that they set on a timed basis...ie..only so many hours left to get certain challenges and eggs for easter.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B0081IRIKI 4 1377820800 34 I have had to uninstall this app twice, but it's worth it I really enjoy the variety of slots, free spin bonuses and the bonus games. I hope that they have fixed the glitches.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B0073LHCCS 5 1349654400 38 I don't like crossword puzzles, I love this game though!!!  I really like the fact of making a new word with one more or less letter than the last or next word.  It's like cheating a crossword puzzle.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B00GY0HJ4K 5 1388102400 101 Thanks to my brother I am addicted to this game.  I had forgotten about it  for a while after my visit with him and he had me playing it on his iPad.  I loved it so much I couldn't put it down, I couldn't remember what it was called and with life's goings on I keep forgetting to ask him.  Now I'm not able to quit playing it on my Kindle fire.  It's driving me nuts trying to get those three stars each time, I just can't stand to have less than the three stars before I can move on.  UGGHHHH!!!!
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B006D1ONE4 5 1353715200 73 I played this on my brothers IPad and fell in love with it...it is so addicting.  I had to have it when I got my Kindle Fire for my Birthday.  Each screen gets more and more challenging and if you don't like the results time-wise you can restart your screen over.  Such a silly game, but you can loose hours playing it.  Great time waster when your waiting for an appointment or whatever.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B0099AQQPK 4 1365811200 41 I guess it's pretty good since I didn't want to stop to write a review.  I like that you can get extra credits with the guessing of the treasure chests.  Don't really get the thrill like doubling up, but it works.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B008K6G8CK 5 1397433600 25 I really enjoy the variety of games, but my favorite is Deal or No Deal.  I just hope that they don't get rid of it.
A112J5JFEPQ0PR B008Y2FRFO 5 1349740800 51 I have always loved this game.  I just wish you could start with more coins, but I do love that you can get prizes and cash them in for more coins.  I don't like the fact that it's a free game and they give you the option to purchase more coins.
A112L5755DD08L B008K6HN8I 1 1360281600 58 I bought the book by Shelby Johnson &#34;Kindle Fire HD User's Guide Book: Unleash the Power of your Tablet&#34; and tried to download this product, but when talking to a customer support agent, found out this program had nothing to do with my Kindle, and I can't take pictures on my tablet because it has no back lens.
A112L5755DD08L B00AXKPWSM 1 1360281600 35 I bought this camera thinking I would be able to take pictures on mhy Kindle Fire HD, but because there's no way to take pictures looking from the back of the tablet, it was useless.
A112LDCS0VM2RF B00CAK052Q 5 1403481600 18 This is the best car game ever!I tried it and it was a great game.I love the cars
A112LDCS0VM2RF B00ESNW58K 5 1402617600 36 This game is really fun!But the things that everyone said about the Crystals were wrong.You can earn crystals , too!I earn 64 crystals. So if you want to get this game,remember that you can earn crystals.
A112MVKH8F3FNK B0054JZC6E 3 1328918400 25 Its pretty fun but gets frustrating. Over all I would recommend this app for people. Its really not that bad otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
A112MVKH8F3FNK B004WKWU5M 5 1329004800 22 This app is awesome!!!! I can't stop using it! I recommend it for everyone, I love it, its the best thing ever!:-)
A112NDN7HZ46ON B008K8U13K 1 1356220800 37 I did buy this app but it will not load and when it does you can not even play.it might be that it just is not compatible with the kindle fire.  I would buy a diff app.
A112NDN7HZ46ON B00769WNK8 1 1331769600 26 do not I repet do not get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is soooo dificult and it is annoying. do not ever ever ever ever get this app
A112NDN7HZ46ON B008Y7SMQU 4 1354320000 29 I like this game. it is fun. if you see a logo you know you get points and hints. my sister thinks it is a fun and cool game.bye.
A112NDN7HZ46ON B006VXRNYG 5 1327968000 23 love it totally worth more than nothing. make little movies for my dad.such a cute and fun app.it is fantabbytabulus. :) (; &lt;3
A112PN6VVFJM6Z B009ZHQLHA 1 1353456000 24 meh it looks fun but take the others advise I wont no much Cu's I nvr downloaded it in ur face amazon app store!
A112PN6VVFJM6Z B00992CF6W 1 1356220800 45 ok its too pricey if it becomes the free app of the day I will take it but right now no way. I mean come on seven dollars for minecraft? srsly?! come on amazon! cant you put it free app of the day or something?!
A112PN7NQD2932 B00BOW41P8 4 1375660800 31 Keep up with all the current stories. I still use the radio a lot for news on the hour, but NYTimes goes into more detail, and will help keep you informed.
A112PN7NQD2932 B00A701GSS 5 1374451200 31 News, any time, any place, on your Kindle Fire HD!You'll always be on top of the latest, breaking stories.I've always loved NPR. You, too? Then, donate!Support this great institution. Thank you.
A112PN7NQD2932 B00FX6ZBXC 5 1405728000 42 When I started playing this game it was so enjoyable that I couldn't stop playing! I had to turn down the bird chirping though, as it can get somewhat annoying. I'm glad a friend introduced this game to me. -- Dee Hart
A112PN7NQD2932 B00FZEK72M 4 1399507200 95 You're pretty smart, right? Well, think again. This game forces you to &quot;connect the dots,&quot; so to speak. Associations can mean different things to different people. It's a little frustrating at times, you'll find. Take a breath! Come back to it later if the right word doesn't pop into your head. Have a conversation with another person, and low and behold,  just maybe two heads are better than one to solve a stumper. At any rate, it's a good game to play with a boy or girl, especially if English is challenging. Just have fun!
A112PN7NQD2932 B004TTY694 2 1353628800 26 It might be great for most people. I usually have a pad of paper and a pen handy. Still, I have to give it a chance.
A112PN7NQD2932 B0093QQAEM 5 1374710400 20 Highly rated, and I recommend it! Updated more often than other news sources. Apply it today! You won't be sorry.
A112PN7NQD2932 B0094FYBB6 4 1357084800 51 There are fewer people who are connected to this, as I have come to find out. I like to play with random people and it takes quite a while to search for a partner. However, if you like &#34;hangman&#34; you will like this game. I still like WWF a lot better!
A112PN7NQD2932 B0097HTPE4 4 1352764800 36 Play on your Kindle Fire, as I do. Best to play when not tired.(Re-challenge yourself when you're wide awake.) Go from one star to two, thentwo to three for a perfect score. (10 points or under)deesews4dolls
A112PN7NQD2932 B008194C74 4 1374451200 26 Just enough of the free version to get a taste of these stumpers!Not sure if I would go as far as buying the &#34;package,&#34; but VERYchallenging!
A112PN7NQD2932 B00GCT92CU 4 1390089600 32 This is an interesting game you play alone or have a youngster &quot;help&quot; you determine the correct answer. It can spur a great curiosity and  a taste of competition in the child.
A112PN7NQD2932 B007D3JV84 3 1375660800 21 This appeals to kids, especially. I will stick to my word games and Draw Something! Fun for the first 10 minutes.
A112PN7NQD2932 B007BFSYMS 4 1387497600 21 Pleasant and annoying sounds. You decide......The grandkids like hearing and guessing which sound I play. I make a game of it.
A112PN7NQD2932 B007USZX7U 2 1366416000 27 Not liking this much - game hesitates to get the confounded ads in........ so irritating!I'm sticking with the MahJong that came with my Kindle Fire, for free.DMH
A112PN7NQD2932 B007XKEY6Q 5 1369094400 83 Updated my review! Now that I know how to delete the no-shows, that is, the players that only do a game or two..... Swipe over their name, then X the delete prompt! You'll always find another random player, ready to play! Of course, you will find some players to be anxious to continue playing. More addicting than I can stand, though! It helps if you're a good artist or like drawing. I usually have 5-10 plays to catch up with every morning.Love it!
A112PN7NQD2932 B0066T8SDU 4 1347840000 55 One must be patient to play. I have a Kindle Fire which is fast but Scrabble takes some time to load. But once it is loaded will entertain me. The teacher feature is very helpful, even to me (I'm over 70). I also enjoy the one player game, when I can play against the &quot;machine.&quot;
A112PSQ044PDF9 B004GYOQ6A 5 1309564800 59 This is one of the few games I've played that I can just play a level or two of without getting too sucked in.  I've had the free version for almost a year and just dealt with the ads so I was really happy to see the full one for free today.  Runs very smooth on my Droid X.
A112PSQ044PDF9 B004J1DBJI 5 1302134400 40 Fun to play around with and a fantastic resource for anything and everything. I already purchased this app on the android market and it was worth it. Glad to see it free on amazon so more people can try it.
A112PSQ044PDF9 B00685VI98 2 1326931200 28 for being &quot;ad-free&quot; this app sure does beg you to like it on facebook a lot. I don't even use facebook anymore and it just keeps begging me.
A112QKYLJ8HNQB B004K56MNU 5 1372723200 37 I LOVE IT :D. ITS SO PERFECT AND I LIVE HOW IT AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES. ITS PERFECT AND I LOVE IT. ITS ONE OF MY FAV. APPS AND ITS INCREDIBLE HANDS DOWN TO READ WITHOUT INTERNET. ITS PERFECT
A112QKYLJ8HNQB B005ZFOOE8 5 1389052800 48 I love it it's better than Pandora because you don't have to wait like 5 songs to get another song by that aprtist. I live this so and the alarm that wakes me up with anything I want to hear. I love it 5 stars no 10!!!!! :)
A112QKYLJ8HNQB B009UX2YAC 5 1381536000 29 I love this game. Sometimes it glitches but it's good. Make sure you update it sometimes. It's a good game and I love it. You should get it. :D
A112SIVLOW0XEK B00CF6J2G0 5 1403827200 22 this is a fun game, lots of different quests. I wish there were even more quests. I would buy the next one.
A112SIVLOW0XEK B009T8X93O 5 1387497600 24 This is a fun game that doesn't get old, I wish there were more games like this. Hoping a new one will come out.
A112SIVLOW0XEK B00DRPVE3M 3 1388707200 22 Wish you didn't have to buy stuff to keep playing, there are also a lot of adds and they are very long.
A112SIVLOW0XEK B00D6SBOWG 4 1379808000 20 Very addictive game. Wish the extra games at the end u didnt have to buy. Other than that awesome game
A112SIVLOW0XEK B00F8H0LM2 5 1379808000 20 Another great game really loved the star wars characters. I like it for my kids nothing bad in this game
A112SIVLOW0XEK B007ZGO7EM 5 1387497600 21 Just what I needed. Very large so you can see it, easy to use. I highly recommended this app to anyone
A112SIVLOW0XEK B00CZDSK7K 4 1384819200 32 I have had to restart my game due to new kindle and it didn't save anything. Had to redo everything, if it would save your stuff it would be a better game.
A112WMYKX31JYX B00E8W4HQE 1 1380585600 67 So far two bonus rounds have locked up and the only way to get it working again is to delete it and reinstall.  Guess what happens--I lose the credits I bought.  Also  I've played for several hours and not once have I hit three scatters in any of the games.  The bonus rounds need to be fixed.  I'm deleting for the last time--no.more lucky slots for me.
A112YL94W69QJS B00CH87HF4 5 1388534400 25 It is an amazing game where no matter what your super overpowering but would be better if you had a better way to get gems
A112YL94W69QJS B00HV0FBEM 5 1390694400 24 This game is absolutely amazing compared with the previous versions of the game with the graphics are completely different and a million times better
A112YL94W69QJS B00AW3FDIO 5 1388707200 25 It's a great game that is enticing and addicting unlike anything I've ever seen I'm never going to put down my game it's that addicting
A1130CW6H5VK6W B00IG2DOKM 4 1404432000 21 I have been playing this game for about a month now and  I love it.  Keeps your interest and challenges you.
A1130CW6H5VK6W B006R6VG9K 4 1395014400 22 I have really gotten into this game.  It's tougher than most to master so I enjoy the challenge.  Still working on it!
A1132WDQ9D83WD B004I744AS 5 1357516800 20 when I change into offline mode it download all definition words and you can use it any time in anywhere!
A1132WDQ9D83WD B00701L6TQ 5 1397174400 71 Man, i love this game! I had been look for this kind of game and found it. I played it and really enjoy. I like the part is when starship shoot a sound wave and is best weapon. I dont like the way is some kind of creatures orb followed me where i cant shoot at them. I recommend this game useful for any players who is good at flying game.
A11395RIFJA1JM B008Y2FRFO 4 1350604800 30 I really like this game even though I'm alittle to old for it. Still I play it and still enjoy it! I do suggest this for really any age! :)
A11395RIFJA1JM B00AREIAI8 4 1359936000 22 really really really really really really really really really really really fun. I love this app!!!  really cool and there is unicorns!!
A11395RIFJA1JM B0054JZC6E 5 1359763200 22 I have this app on all of my devices and use it a lot for wasting time. its pretty cool and fun.
A1139C7T4W7FUQ B0087SGWI6 4 1362700800 34 I like this app becuase it has a lot of variety and I like games that work the mind. Would def download more like it so long as it had different types of games
A1139C7T4W7FUQ B004GVYXTS 4 1362700800 47 Playing in 1 and 2 person mode is both fun, The only issue I had is when playing 2 player it stops at a score of 3 and sometimes it continues on. I don't feel like it is an issue enough to not play or like it
A1139L6BZ1BS49 B0067Q4DPE 5 1331942400 21 it was awesome. I love how it has a story to go along with it. makes it more interesting to play
A1139L6BZ1BS49 B00FAPF5U0 4 1390435200 20 This game is fun but hard.  I love that. It makes me use my mind, and is challenging. Cool game.
A113B6Y9KG5YEU B00DGMVC4C 5 1388102400 73 I originally palyed sparkle 1 and experienced some bugs with it and it kept freezing. I took a chance and purchased sparkle 2. I have not been disappointed since. The color schemes of the spheres and the power ups of the orbs is out of this world. Great job to the developers. I like this version for the improvements and the total re-design of the original. I spend a lot of time playing.
A113B6Y9KG5YEU B00634GHJA 5 1376784000 23 This app is great. This is the easiest app I have used and tried to transfer pictures. Not hard to use at all.
A113B6Y9KG5YEU B00CSR2J9I 5 1379289600 23 Very addictive. You find yourself going back for more. Its fun and nerve racking, but you just can't SOP and put it down.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B00881VLCE 4 1368921600 34 I really enjoy these puzzles. I did have a problem in the past where purchased puzzle packs disappeared, (I deleted apt after that) but now I`m trying again, but only with the free packs!
A113CZRDZLFK8V B00FIP4SLO 4 1384560000 21 This is entertaining. Not difficult at all. Nice to pass time with when waiting for an appointment or other such event.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B00BGC5UAG 3 1365292800 48 I enjoy playing this game, however, some of the pictures have nothing to do with the word. In order to get letter hints, it's better to buy the &quot;Pro&quot; version for just 99&cent;. They must have upgraded the Pro version as there is now more then 100 puzzles.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B00EEDJHXA 5 1401580800 24 This game starts off fairly easy, but gets More and more difficult as it goes. It is fun and challenging. A great brain exercise.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B00AEWUQG2 3 1389571200 89 I enjoy playing this game, but you only get 10 seconds to answer a question plus you're playing against others instead of just for yourself which is added stress. When you run out of stars, you have to wait a day for a free spin to get more or pay for more which I will not do. Too bad all of the points you accumulate do not give you stars to play with. I don't like the fact that the game wants you to connect to Facebook as well.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B007BTE2F2 3 1351987200 32 It's a good app, however, the quiz never changes. Once you take the quiz, that's it. It's always the same questions. No challenge there. Could be better, but nice for the basics.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B004HGK6FW 4 1351209600 24 This app works great for me.  I really enjoy playing it. Haven't run into any problems what so ever. Works well on Kindle Fire!
A113CZRDZLFK8V B008FRG6JO 4 1351987200 48 Having the Dominos Pizza App loaded and at the ready is easier then pulling it up off the web. Also better then calling and waiting on hold. Works great and easy to use. Just be sure to check out the coupons FIRST and click on one BEFORE ordering!
A113CZRDZLFK8V B008IXP8IU 4 1352851200 23 I enjoy playing this game. It is a challenging way to pass the time. Anyone who enjoys word games would like this game.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B004HE5TAG 3 1347926400 20 It's fun so far. I need to figure out how to end game so that I can open the settings.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B00IZMQ8G0 4 1399420800 58 I'm really enjoying playing this game. While a lot of the questions are easy, there's a fair number of challenging questions. To save on &quot;fuel&quot; to play, just spend &quot;fuel&quot; on the challenges. Each time you win a challenge, you get one free game play, but they don't accumulate. You have to play the free game right away.
A113CZRDZLFK8V B008AZGWYK 1 1363996800 81 This app does not download to the Kindle Fire HD. When I try to 're-load it, a popup tells me that I already own it -  But it is Nowhere on my device. When I do a &#34;search&#34; for it, a popup tells me that I need to purchase it. Cannot purchase it as the &#34;store&#34; claims I already have it. Just a vicious circle!!! I have sent an e-mail to customer service as others with this problem should also do.
A113D8A506QIRM B00IAQ3RJM 5 1398556800 28 I really like this game. It's so cute and fun. The game is like any regular jewel game but the cuteness of it just really grabs he attention.
A113D8A506QIRM B00AA87JGU 4 1372550400 26 I really like this game. Most of these escape games are really easy but this one makes me think and have fun at the same time.
A113D8A506QIRM B00IKZX1ZI 4 1394841600 34 Good game. I thought it was going to be just for kids but it's very addictive. Though I don't think it's really for kids but more for adults because the puzzles do get hard.
A113D8A506QIRM B00E3CFTJS 4 1399334400 30 I really like the game. It's a really pretty game and runs very smooth not all choppy like. The game play is easy to use and its all around fun.
A113D8A506QIRM B00E8KLWB4 4 1395878400 28 This is a good game. It has a great visual aspect to it and I like the multiple puzzles in it. It's not just a seek and find.
A113D8A506QIRM B00FXKHEK6 4 1384992000 20 This game was a lot better than I had first thought. Great for kids to my little niece loves it.
A113FN90EPPVY6 B0089BPEZS 5 1401926400 20 I get to watch all the great movies on the move. I love it at work when I'm on break!
A113FN90EPPVY6 B005LIYX5Y 4 1331596800 23 The game is great but after I updated all my progress was erased. I tried to use my profile and wont let me.
A113FWTT3WBMJX B00AZL3PBK 2 1366243200 25 I don't like this Mario wannabe. It's such a shame to rip off the world's best arcade game. Sorry. Maybe play the real Super Mario?
A113FWTT3WBMJX B006D1ONE4 1 1366243200 24 I can't open it, but I'm not saying it's bad, I just want to play the game. would rate 5 stars if I can!
A113FWTT3WBMJX B004SJ3BCI 5 1332028800 22 I just love the angry birds!!!! I love everything except the hard levels. The pigs are so funny!!!!!!!!!! Bird is the word!!!!!
A113J9KNLO6Q66 B00B2V66VS 5 1397520000 60 Temple run is a great game for kids and will keep them busy if you need to do things around the house . It also has a Easter theme so there are not regular coins they are eggs. There is fun things with it while playing like going on ropes going in the water and going in a mine cart
A113J9KNLO6Q66 B007693VXG 5 1343001600 21 its alsome. my daughter plays. on it every day.  she love it.  my daughter can pass lots of levels  every day
A113J9KNLO6Q66 B00G5LQ5MU 5 1390003200 26 it is a good game for kids you have to escape from room to room. my daughter loves it because she likes to figure things out
A113LCBS05TWXK B007TBAQCK 3 1335657600 22 pretty fun to kill time. doesn't really make me want to go to Vegas because I don't ever win but who cares.
A113LCBS05TWXK B00C2VIA52 4 1381881600 32 Im a MTG fan for life so nothing will ever really compare but this game is fun enough for me to try. the game mechanics are unique and i like the art.
A113LCBS05TWXK B00EZWPFW2 3 1380931200 49 i like it but right from the start the riddles are above average in difficulty. and when you get one right you only get a few coins making the hint option a bummer unless you actually want to spend real money. thats lame. bigger rewards for harder riddles please!

A113QGTQCHIU8Z B009UX2YAC 5 1373241600 53 Great game my 4year old grandson showed me how to play. I think it would be more interesting to play if the shop items such as outfits and boards weren't so expensive to purchase. If a child could change the looks of his charactor it might be more of a talked about app.
A113QGTQCHIU8Z B00A4KVFLY 4 1379548800 19 It's a fun game. Much to strict on thewording. It don't give you enough coins to start off with.
A113QGTQCHIU8Z B00DJFIMW6 5 1376697600 24 I like this game.  Challenging and quick..if I die,I get all upset. Very fun thank you for making something not so bloods gutsAnd horrifying.

A1147KUXDIXQWF B0054JZC6E 4 1325894400 37 pretty decent game for free. Most of the reviews are correct it's a lot of simple games and you have to get a specific high score to &quot;pass&quot; the level and get points to by the game.
A1147KUXDIXQWF B008UZ00TI 4 1345334400 42 pretty fun game. nice twist on angry birds type of game with cute graphics. I think be because it's. free it only lets me play two levels then force closes.  would be a glitches tho I haven't read all the reviews yet.

A114AIFVGXP3RM B00E78QIDE 5 1375401600 20 This a very fun but very difficult game. really gets the brain juices flowing. good for keeping the brain healthy
A114AIFVGXP3RM B00DYY92MG 3 1375574400 26 I'm not much of a Tv watcher so I have a hard time with the game but others may find it fun. to each their own.
A114AO4UU18U1E B00L3MNCNQ 5 1405468800 29 It is so easy with all our  multitasking to loose the ability to see the small things in the world. This app helps you regain your power of observation.
A114AO4UU18U1E B00AUXZJAS 4 1397174400 29 Good way to stay sharp on skills that you may not use often. Like the variety of games and will do for now until Luminosity comes out for Kindle.
A114AO4UU18U1E B00DHKKN6Q 3 1397952000 22 Another version of a bubble saga. Not to a bad way to pass time. Good for kids too. Graphics could be better.

A114BXE18MZBS6 B00632HWOG 4 1376006400 22 I Love Yahoo! It Shows Me All My Mail And Still Bring Up Spam Just In Case It Was An Accident !
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00HEVJU7W 3 1388188800 23 Mostly all there is to do is to watch nick videos and stuff there isn't really any games to play on there though.
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00BYJ6BUO 1 1390521600 26 I got this app to watch agents of shield but then it satred to glitch up my kindle so I got rid of it right away!
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00DOIBYYG 4 1388188800 63 I had this app only for a little while I mean I know it shows some funny clips now.and then but you half to follow people to find some real actual funny stuff and I might've got lazy and didn't want to do that part. So if you really like finding weird people with their funny comedies this is the app for you!
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B0094BB4TW 5 1390521600 29 I check my fb all the time its quick and easy, and u can have instant chat on there too so get tjis if u have a fb ok?
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00FATEJYE 1 1390521600 21 Mostly all it is is punching annd fighting u just tap tap tap and swipe swipe swipe u dont do much?!?!?!?
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00AIUUXHC 5 1388188800 51 You would really like this game if you like marine animals and sometimes there maybe blood. Well when your a shark and you have to go around and eat food to get bigger there will most likely be blood. Anyway this game was really fun to me I would get it!
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00BQPEIT2 5 1390521600 43 This app os so much fun!!! It is mostly like temple run 2 &1 but u get to run in different worlds than 1 so I would get this since it shows the oz great and powerful characters and its just really fun!
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00AFCEIB0 3 1390521600 54 This is ok for a searching app but I just have my silk internet browser and its just easier for me with that so I would just keep my silk browser and not get this I mean if you want another search browser on ur kindle and uses up storage thats fine with me...:)
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B005ZXWMUS 5 1390521600 29 If u have a netflix at home on ur wii then ur good to go. U cant access this app without having access to netflix on ur tv though
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B0086700CM 3 1390521600 23 I would just rather get temple run 2 its not high definition u dont do much in it its just not as fun
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00DUGCLY4 5 1403222400 26 this game is coolio u getget to guess the word by looking qt the emojis sometimes they r hard tho... &eth; good lick it really fun!&eth;'&eth;'&eth;'
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00529IOXO 2 1390521600 42 Well u do get to text to friends on this app but it doesnt let u see who it is like who ur talking to well u know of course. Its ok for texting I just would recomend that text now app
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00BFWY2KG 2 1390521600 70 I got this app so I could watch my fav disney shows but I could only watch special things of certain shows and u have to have a tv server which I have directv and it doesn't have that on there for me bit it does have x-finity and all the others. So I would get this only if u really like disney channel and have a certain tv server.
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B0097C8XL0 5 1388188800 21 This game is.Mostly about penguin and octopuses fighting over fish. It's kinda like subway surfers but with penguin. Good graphics also!
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00B2V66VS 5 1390521600 25 This app is so much better than temple run 1 its more hd and has more things u can do its really fun adventure game.
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B005HSL626 4 1390521600 23 In this app you r mostly cutting up fruit with ur fingers and just see how high of a score u can get
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B008J1ZVRY 5 1390521600 36 This I mostly like the temple run 1&2 & ox ones but its more of the brave movie with merida. U do get to shoot bow and arrows while running thats the fun part for me!
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00AB7HESI 5 1390521600 60 I bought this game for my brother since he likes to create things with his mind and well its more of a thunking game I would say since u half to think of what comes next or what would u do in this situation. Its fun for kids to learn and think and well it lets their creativity out! :)
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B008JGSM6G 4 1390521600 20 This game is really fun I guess well u just connect colors and well it gets boring after a while
A114D3RWPFJYMJ B00EHM0CVE 3 1388188800 36 Your playing spongebob and being a waiter in the Krusty Krab so you get to play a little while or a couple levels and then you half to.l buy or upgrade to get the whole game.
A114FAPDFXRALL B005ZXWMUS 1 1402617600 44 For the Kindle Fire HD this Netflix app is lacking in every way. Maybe its because its the Kindle . Less and less is available for the Kindle. You can search and search and 90% comes up as NOT AVAILABLE. Not worth the price.
A114FAPDFXRALL B004MC0FO8 1 1398988800 39 At one time Shazam was the way to go. For some reason it only works 15% of the time. Music from a television forget it. If I was trying to identify some Tibetan religious music I could understand BUT_____
A114H621Y7BKXC B008CFVG58 4 1343174400 17 fun and addictedgood funWe got the app today and haven't  put it downFun for kids and adults.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00CXVX1OQ 3 1379808000 33 This game is not for me. To much of a fast pace with the boxing, but my son is crazy about it. I will keep it so he can play when he visit.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00EBQRSTK 5 1379462400 101 I helped my grand daughter with a game like this that she had on her cell. I really got into it and decided to try this one. I love the game but don't like the fact, it takes 60 coins from you for just one hint and give only 4 coins when you guess it right. I haven't used delete some letters because it takes 90 coins away. Once you run out of coins, I guess that's it unless you can find someone to help you. It is a good game for your mind and that is what I find interesting.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00EYIG5US 4 1379462400 108 This game requires good memory as well as good eyesight, and knowing how to spell the celebrities names. What I don't care for is the numbers of coins that are to be taking away for clues (60 coins) and to remove letters (100 coins). As soon as you build your pile, thinking you are doing good they throw 1 or 2 pictures in, that is not well known and almost wipe you out..( 100 coins are too much.) It would be easier if they had spaces between their first and last name. I will continue to play as long as I have money because I like the challenge.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B004TI2ZXY 2 1389571200 22 The Map quest work fine but couldn't get the GPS to work. I decided to keep it just for the car direction.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00CRLSN4U 4 1379808000 133 I got into this game because I love watching movies. I even called my sister to come on board just incase I run into any problems. We realized that the game that suppose to be fun is now causing us to be frustrated. You can't go back and you can't skip incase you can't figure it out. If you use all your coins , you will be at a stand still until someone come alone to help build your points back  or just stopped playing  all together. I don't want that because I like this game but you should have other options when you just can't get the answer. To top it off, you only gain one point when you guess the correct answer. Bring the fun in the game with different rules.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00A4KVFLY 4 1389571200 43 I really like this game. My grandchildren and I play it a lot. The only thing I dislike is the time is too quick especially since you have to write your answers down. Slow the time down, than you could receive 5 stars.
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00AMR1HZ8 5 1379462400 50 I only download this game to play with my sister, even though we haven't played yet. I played solo and it's pretty much like the TV game. I just have to get use to it. (I used to play with the show on TV and did a very good job).
A114LRC6WGCGT8 B00FAPF5U0 2 1389571200 31 My granddaughter download this game. She plays it when she come over. I don't care for it because I heard it's a very addictive game. More power to those who do...ENJOY!
A114M1JGBZ0W8I B00FAPF5U0 5 1405641600 34 I'd heard how people were so addicted to this game and couldn't understand how it could be addictive - till I got it!!! I'm hooked!!! My husband hates it 'cause I'm constantly playing it!!!
A114M1JGBZ0W8I B00C7TAF3Y 5 1387756800 29 Very intriguing &quot;puzzles&quot; with fantastic graphics!! I have found no other game to match this one!! Hope the creative minds behind The Room are diligently working on more chapters!!
A114O66XY5YZ12 B007PT3QOQ 5 1372204800 30 Great game so far and I just started I'm excited to see all you can do, very addicting and best part is that it's FREE....great for all ages please try
A114O66XY5YZ12 B00BS3UFCQ 5 1367971200 21 Love it definitely worth it and the best part? It's FREE, fun to play easy to navigate and overall great game
A114O66XY5YZ12 B00E8KLWB4 5 1390003200 46 This game is awesome the graphics are very nice on my kindle fire and the music isn't annoying like on most games it's easy once you get the hang of it and gets your mind working with different pictures and puzzles, a terrific choice and FREE!
A114R3SEGEW9J8 B0069G5Z9K 4 1389225600 40 ummm this is awesome as heck but one thing every thing cost sooo much and its hard to get coins VERY! me and my cousin played we had fun I would buy this for ur kids and maybe ur self
A114R3SEGEW9J8 B00B2V66VS 4 1362441600 21 it's k but bad I mean Bad graphics and chareters  make this be helpful im Justin bieber baby, around the world
A114ROI4MRZRQL B007EC27QM 5 1383350400 22 Works great for calculating anything, hard to understand why it is not built into the Android OS it is a basic need.
A114ROI4MRZRQL B005ZXWMUS 5 1376784000 23 Great for road warriors & much cheaper than buying DVDs or BluRays, extensive library with all of the choices you could hope for.
A114ROI4MRZRQL B008RMEGXA 5 1382140800 40 Picked this up because of the young lady pictured on the cover, she was featured some years ago & you can still see the beauty in her eyes & face, but the innocence (because of war & strife) is gone...
A114ROI4MRZRQL B00E1JZIGW 5 1382140800 28 I only watch educational, informational or sports programs. Discovery has set the bar for delivery of content with a depth & width or offerings that has no equal.
A114ROI4MRZRQL B00E5NH46Q 5 1376784000 21 Just got my Kindle Fire HD & am really enjoying the experience, having all of my favorite channels everywhere is awesome!!
A114ROI4MRZRQL B00EOUGFNS 4 1383436800 33 Select the sport you want to track & the scoreboard is up. Watching the Colts vs. Texans tonight & the play update generally runs 15 to 60 seconds behind real time. Not bad.
A114ROI4MRZRQL B00BYJ6BUO 4 1383436800 20 Not bad, doesn't stream in my area, but you have a decent selection of recorded episodes available for your review.
A114ROI4MRZRQL B00C25OI36 5 1385942400 23 I am an absolute foodie & this offers me every recipe I could ever need at my fingertips, all while being easily retrievable.
A114ROI4MRZRQL B008RA3X5E 3 1382140800 58 Suited the need while I was on the road, but the Kindle does not fall asleep while it is active & if you don't have the quick charger with you & plugged in it will drain the battery which would negate the effectiveness of it as your battery will be dead & the alarm will never go off.
A114VBNRP509H6 B00FRQ32N4 5 1389916800 23 This is a great game and it is totally awesome! And I am only typing this to get real gold coins! LOL! Lollipop
A114VBNRP509H6 B005T87QCI 3 1371686400 45 It's an ok app... the gameplay is great and all, but if u wanna buy a robot or something u have to pay real money! Don't be deceived, cause it says that u can make a custom robot, but u have to pay! Just sayin'!
A114VBNRP509H6 B00992CF6W 5 1347753600 22 this game is awesome but if you want it for free go to 4shared.com that is how you get it for free!!!
A114VBNRP509H6 B008841TP0 1 1345593600 25 just go to 4shared.com and type in minecraft pocket edition 0.3.3 and download and play! Also 0.4.0 update comes out in mid-September 2012!!!!!!! Your welcome!!!
A114VBNRP509H6 B007JPG04E 5 1340496000 21 Everybody should buy this game!!!! It is really addicting!!!  buy the best game right now! a a a a a a
A114VBNRP509H6 B009WYCDZU 5 1368403200 56 The game is awesome! Graphics R good, but it should be a 5 starred game... these dumb guys from some Sims game R giving it 1 star because there's some ad for this game on Sims and it's supposedly annoying... I don't even care because Sims is dumb! Well hope this review helped!  See ya!!! ;D
A114W37M2SD49M B00918L02E 5 1369958400 30 This game wasn't the best at first it was too hard. Then I got the hang of it and I love it. It's almost as good as ice cream jump.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00E0TK5G6 4 1395360000 44 I haven't completed it yet but what i have played has been fun. No glitches at this point. It is hard to see certain objects on a kindle but that is the case with any game. I like the graphics and the story line.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B004TSAPIQ 5 1364083200 33 worth the download,  A lot of fun. I let the grand babies play it and it keeps them occupied if we are in a store or in the car and they get restless
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00CBKLO52 5 1395360000 43 My grandson loves this. There are different vehicles, planes, helicopters he can fly and he seemed to need no assistance figuring the controls out and he is 3. Great time filler for car rides, Dr appts etc.. For free you can't go wrong.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B008YRVW0I 5 1374624000 21 having a great time with this game. Very addicting. Basic match 3 but love the aquariums, its fun to decorate them!!!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B007ZQK1MY 5 1357862400 55 I have this on my PC and it was no let down on my Kindle fire, same great game. No sticking or slow spots, Downloaded quickly and it is just fun to play!!! So worth the money you spend to get it, i hope they put more like this out there for Nook and Kindle
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00CC59H8W 5 1395360000 52 My grandson plays this for hours and while its a little diabolical offing teddy bears the developer made them grumpy enough that you mind lol. Really cute graphics and a lot of fun to play. Great game to help kids with hand and eye coordination and other motor skills. Its a keeper!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00DHKKN6Q 5 1403913600 38 Great fun, like bubble witch saga but not as costly. I would just rather they charge me for these games then say free and you have to buy lives, ext tee a bubbles etc...but fun all the sane
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00IYOACQ6 5 1397088000 52 Different than I expected. It's not one of those games you can't find your way out. You just have to think and work at it. If your really stuck you can go to a walk through after watching several ads, but it is free so you deal with it. Nice game, enjoyable.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B007XKEY6Q 5 1357862400 34 Our kids love this, you can play with other people and I believe its the same app they have on the iphone 4. Again its free so get it while you can. what fun!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00AEJPK0C 5 1367020800 25 Great game a lot of fun!! Very addicting!!! It was free and you have full game play...I LOVE it!!! Don't lose out on this one!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B009RLG7RI 4 1390608000 29 Not a lot to say for this one. Again dont remember a lot about it. Must not have kept me intrigued. Just wasnt my cup of tea I guess
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B008CGZZHW 5 1357862400 34 The same old Yatzee and you can play others or the computer. Very addicting and its free!! I have spent a lot of fun hours playing, so download while it is free and enjoy!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00ILI95HW 5 1395360000 102 I have all of the games in this series and I LOVE them all. I have been playing them for months and months and somehow I don't tire of them. It is the same principal as fruit drops but with balloons. I found this game a little more challenging then the others, but in a good way. They are all very challenging and so much fun but this one has beat me more than the others ;). Love this developer, simple idea, easy to play with enough power up items to keep you going. Looking forward to next one Midnight App Smith!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B009PCBEPE 5 1402531200 36 This is hands down one of best games I have found and free to boot. My grandson and I have a blast trying to compete in each level. It's a no brainer , get the app!!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00CWY76CC 5 1397260800 40 Enjoyable. Makes you think and use logic to get from room to room. They are no hard to navigate but you do have to have some problem solving skills to get through and patience. Fun and a great time passer.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B0097EWK3A 5 1364083200 35 I am a BFG fan, I have there games on my PC and now on my kindle and Nook. The games runs flawlessly and has a lot of game play. Would recommend it to anyone
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00E83G68K 4 1395705600 20 Who doesn't love the muppets. My grand kids love this. Interactive, bright colors, seems to be fun for all involved.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00BL0I7WG 5 1397260800 32 Nice HOS, fairly simple, but fun. You can find objects by shape, name, shadow or a mix. Bright colors, graphics well done. What a great FREE game!!! Grab it while its free.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00EKDZEF4 5 1377820800 48 Great game!! A lot of fun and very addicting. I think its more fun than candy crush without paying extra. Basic match three but plenty of levels and with a lot of twists, for the price you cannot go wrong. I look forward to more games like it!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B0064TVQ5E 5 1364083200 31 Works good and free. We saved money and still got nice game for the phone. Mahjong is a good game and a good puzzle game for those that like that genre
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00GTGSEW0 5 1390608000 33 I have the 1st 2 games and bought this, the 3rd installment. I love the game, play it every night to help me relax before bed. Only complaint is that it sticks sometimes.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00A4EZ3QS 3 1371340800 20 It was just ok, It is more for a small child. there are a lot better free games out there.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B007CK1MEY 5 1364083200 38 Love the game, its a lot of fun and hey its free!! No ads popping up or hit and miss game play because it is free. Its a good time filler so definitely on my top 10 list!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00AQX1KFU 4 1395705600 24 This is a very cute game, the kids love it. Very interactive and educational in a lot of ways.....can't beat it for the price
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00ATSAVQG 5 1395705600 27 This is a neat spin on the average puzzle. I played it through because I didn't want to stop. The 3d effects keep it interesting. Great buy!!
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00CJ77HU8 5 1371340800 28 What a great game and for free you cannot beat it!!!! Little spin of a match 3 and has many levels. Levels get more challenging as you go.
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00FWPWNKS 5 1382486400 36 Loved the first fruit drops and was happy to see #2 come out and I love they stayed in the same format as the first, just more twists. Great job and I am anxious for #3
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B00CH26TL8 4 1404691200 118 Cute and free to download but charges for power ups. I wish free meant free. I understand charging some slight amount for power ups, but the charging 1.99-99.00?? Just too steep for me. And the power up is short lived. Example. .99 for 10 extra balls or 4.99 to get 40 games cash to buy power ups and powers up run 4.00 and up each level you use them. The game is cute and plays really well. Great colors and sounds!! Very addictive, but would rather pay up front for the game then get hit over and over to be able to pass a level. They seem all to be this way, so its not just this developer
A114W5A6ZOP3BT B008M2WGRI 4 1402876800 52 My grandson seems to like it. the only issue I notice is you really cannot shoot fast enough to kill these zombies, they multiple faster than you can shoot so can be frustrating or challenging, however you chose to see it. But for a kid it is frustrating but still cute game
A114WJF60BDREY B00846GKTW 5 1337817600 26 this game is fun to play. if ur into dress up games this is the game for u. so I highly in courage you download it.
A114WJF60BDREY B0067Q4PQQ 5 1328400000 28 This game is so addicting. I can play this game over and over again. I highly recommend that you download it trust me you won't regret it (:
A114WJF60BDREY B004UBH4S6 5 1345161600 31 its a good app. it gives me no trouble when I want to look at my horoscope. so download it if your a person who constantly wants to know their horoscope.
A114WLXQ9M1P9W B00CWY76CC 5 1372032000 25 This games is very cool. It requires a lot of thinking. I like that about a game. Kind of like flow but with more strategy.
A114WLXQ9M1P9W B00AP9U8SA 5 1356998400 26 I like the models and the variety of clothes.  The game really holds the interest of any young girl who likes fashion.  Five stars from me.
A114WLXQ9M1P9W B00AFMLJY4 5 1356998400 20 Hair and clothes are so pretty.  Lots of fun to play.  Easy to play and navigate.  It's hours of fun.
A1153GS2DUCF1V B00BSW0M34 1 1363996800 20 it wont let me go into the game because it says I don't have Internet when I do have internet
A1153GS2DUCF1V B00820STKI 5 1340064000 26 I love this app so much because if you just touch the screen the fireworks will show up ( this is the best app I've had)
A1154WMDBSFRJI B00BUONELM 4 1381622400 52 Loved the game.  I have played it all the way thru 3times.  The only I problem I have had each time is not getting the maze with the lantern to work no matter what I did.  Anyone else have this problem and do you have any idea how to do this correctly?
A1154WMDBSFRJI B00GP0G0IK 1 1391558400 37 I've tried to download this game at least 3 times but unfortunately it seemed to take forever, and I mean hours so I just went ahead and stopped it.  Too bad, I really wanted to play this.
A1154WMDBSFRJI B00G5LQ5MU 2 1384300800 33 Finally made it up the ladder dodging crates and find out you have to blow up the life vest by blowing in the mic.  Kindle doesn't have a mic.  Pissed, wasted my money.
A1156XD0VU0A6H B008JK6W5K 4 1352160000 30 This is addictive, but a little frustrating...like when you have the answer on the tip of your tongue, but can 't spit it out. Wish there were more hints available.
A1156XD0VU0A6H B00D6VP410 5 1372550400 20 Great game. Lots of fun.This game is generous in free plays and bonuses.If you like Bingo, you 'll love this.
A1156XD0VU0A6H B008JGSM6G 5 1351468800 34 This is a good mix of challenging and easier puzzles. I find it addicting trying to beat my scores and my husband's . I 'm glad it was a free app of the day.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B007P6T52G 1 1348617600 36 White Master????  Are you kidding me? I deleted this game before I even started due to the general offensiveness of the dialog. Baby talking Island Barbie rescues White Master....sounds like the plot for a porno movie.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B004V6K38I 5 1314835200 28 This is a really cute little time waster. I like the concept and the pop references. The fact that some Xtians are whining about it is just gravy.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B00BGC5UAG 3 1364169600 22 awful game. no way to pass sp of you get stick you're done forever. also ot needs shuffle to make it playable.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B00689PMD2 1 1335484800 22 please don't let children play this game. read all the reviews. these are stereotypes that need to be erased rather than reinforced.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B007TBAQCK 5 1336867200 28 usually good for at least a few minutes diversion. especially of you play for less than the maximum you're allowed. you people complaining about losing should try that.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B004V4S4MW 5 1310169600 23 I have been using the free version and loving it. It's a great way to keep goals in sight and simple to use.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B0053TKBMU 3 1313020800 25 but I think lightening bug is a better choice. This one was not very intuitive for me and the audio files are not very realistic.
A11577B7DHCSJ1 B008Y2FRFO 5 1349395200 32 I enjoy this game a couple of times a day as a quick break to clear my mind. I wish the walls would stay up a little longer! Otherwise, cute and fun.
A1157VMNQK85W5 B00BJSJKJ4 4 1367712000 21 I love word games even when they frustrate me.  Just played a few times so far but am happy with it.
A1157VMNQK85W5 B009WJNXAE 4 1371945600 20 I love Bingo and this is a pleasant version I can play anytime.Don't have to buy anything more, just  play.
A1157VMNQK85W5 B00CJ8P82Q 3 1367712000 23 Haven't figured it out yet, but I will.  So far I haven't passed level one.  Oh well, keep trying and we'll make it.
A1157VMNQK85W5 B00CN8BTV6 4 1373500800 22 Like the regular game, this one is frustrating.  That's what makes it fun.  Never seem to get that one card you need.
A115BZ8HQ60EZC B004SD5GZ4 1 1367280000 30 To be honest i wanted to play a game online but the said i needed this app  i think it isWeird having the app because it is not the best
A115BZ8HQ60EZC B00AEORXR0 1 1368921600 23 I tried downloading it3 times but it was just black. Anyways be my friend i am  cupcakecutie10 . I might just say yes
A115BZ8HQ60EZC B00CUWWLWG 3 1396742400 20 it is such an amazing game . have to be honest, the croods is a little better. get both games.
A115BZ8HQ60EZC B00BWBHIUG 5 1375056000 29 Best game ev e r. I can not stop playing it. It just like a so amazing. If you game the game you wont stop playing it believe me....
A115CGKCYZID85 B007F2EGFQ 5 1331856000 34 This game is great for girls. For extra fun you can use real money but you can still finish the levels without it. This game does take a long time to download. Have fun!
A115ERDOOK4J21 B004UBH4S6 5 1335312000 20 Great way to start and end the day.Thanks for the free application I love getting the daily information and insights.
A115ERDOOK4J21 B00CH26TL8 4 1404000000 21 Fun game. Addictive and challenging. Wish the Witches were more interactive  throughout the game though. Love their Cackles and laughter too.
A115ERDOOK4J21 B0064X7B4A 4 1370736000 20 Love this game! I have many friends to play with and I also love the random opponent option as well.
A115KS4V4DOGXD B00DRJJAQG 4 1398988800 19 Some are tricky, some are easy.  The pictures are awesome. Traveling with no luggage.Nice game to just have fun.
A115KS4V4DOGXD B009G9KFQ0 5 1404172800 47 This is the only bug I enjoy.  Real bugs search me out &amp; eat me alive.  This is the best &amp; the pictures are all so amazing!! AND, the weather info is great for our home location. Keep up the good work. Find new info every day.
A115KS4V4DOGXD B00BPC23XO 4 1399420800 21 Keeps your mind working. Always played word games. I have my 90 year young Momplay the games. She likes my Kindle!!
A115N8B8BXSIM9 B004UNGZ8Y 1 1313280000 40 Current versions of Android manage memory extremely effectively. Memory managers, task killers, and the like are not only pointless but can cause problems. No one who owns a current phone should install this, and anyone who has should uninstall it.
A115N8B8BXSIM9 B004TTMYQG 4 1304380800 40 Excellent calendar app. The week view is good for seeing where the own times are but not nearly as good for seeing just your scheduled events so the Calendar Pad week view. Add that and I'll give it 5 stars.
A115PPUEZ1654 B00529IOXO 5 1354406400 45 txt plus is the best texting app ever! I got it on the kindle fire and it has worked like a charm! I can text all of my friends in a matter of seconds! I recommend you to get this app for your kindle fire!
A115PPUEZ1654 B0086700CM 5 1355961600 23 temple run is the best game for the kindle fire.I have never had a problem with it.it is the funest game I have.
A115PPUEZ1654 B004SJ3AXI 5 1355961600 26 I love this game! ever since I got the new kindle fire I have loved this game!!!!!! I totaly recommend this for the new kindle fire!
A115PVYDZIACYO B004JZBGWI 5 1377216000 21 Just what I wanted. Allows me to be able to make a quick and easy to find note or reminder.  Perfect!!!!!!
A115PVYDZIACYO B00C2YR3XE 3 1377216000 32 Ok game. Finished free version quickly.  Did not like how fast it would &#34;exit&#34; game and go to &#34;Ads&#34; (almost like don't blink). Did not think it was good enough to purchase.
A115PVYDZIACYO B008R9OIUO 3 1377216000 21 Ok game.  Finished the free version very quickly. I did not like it enough to what to purchase the full version.
A115PVYDZIACYO B0063GORYU 5 1377216000 21 What can you say about this classic game. It is GREAT. I love it on my PC, phone and now tablet.
A115PVYDZIACYO B0064TVQ5E 2 1377216000 22 Deleted it.  Did not like the style/colors of the tiles and game.  Maybe I'm too used to the &#34;plan ole&#34; PC version.
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B00ADIT8U2 5 1356048000 44 This is my favorite type of game to play, better than straight up hidden object cause you have to use your brain. Nice graphics, ran well on my razr. Beat in about 5 hours, worth the money. Left me wishing it was longer though.
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B00ATDOVNK 5 1363996800 34 I've been well pleased with the last few games I've gotten from G5, and this one was no exception. Nice blend of hidden object and mini games, and good game length. Definitely would recommend.
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B008JK6W5K 4 1344643200 161 Love this game and have a blast playing it. It's kind of funny when you see a logo you know you've seen a million times but can't place what it us, but then it finally hits you and you feel a great sense of accomplishment and relief. Some of the logos are really obscure, which is annoying. You can tell they come up with just enough obscure ones to force you to have to buy more clues, and then you still end up having to google the clues because it's some off the wall company you've never heard of. Would be nice if they had separate versions for American and European players, but I guess then they wouldn't sell many clues. Another annoyance is the rigid standards for typing in answers, especially considering some of the clues are misguiding. For instance, one tells you an answer is one word, but it's two words. Overall a great time waster and brain wracker.
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B00ENTE4XS 2 1382054400 119 Was excited to be playing what I thought was one of the better games of this type I'd played in a while, but then got up to the point when you go through the double doors with the snakes (think it's probably the point when the free trial ends) and the game just shuts down. Not only does it shut down there, but if I click the &quot;unlock game&quot; tab on the main screen to purchase the game, it does the same thing, just shuts down. I tried restarting the game numerous times, restarting my phone, nothing helps.  Disappointed because I was looking forward to playing the entire game. How this gets fixed so I can buy the game.
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B0071PARPA 5 1333411200 52 I've tried out a lot of different sketch/drawing apps over time. I like to draw, and I've got kids who love to draw and like the apps. This one is the best I've tried. It has a lot of options, great flexibility in colors, and the sketchy mode is amazing. Love it!
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B004MC8CA2 5 1327363200 47 I seriously don't know what I'd do without this app. I use it for everything from reference when I'm in deep study, to when I need a quick verse to comfort someone. Only thing I can think of that would improve it is a random verse feature.
A115R0YR5MO1A8 B00AIQP9DE 5 1357084800 110 I've purchased and played the majority of games in this genre available on the appstore, and this is one of the best I have played. Graphics are good and fit the eerie storyline well, and the storyline is better than most. But where the game really shines is in it's variety. Good hidden object sequences, and an abundance of different mini games. Quite a bit longer than most other games in this price range. Hint button is handy when you can't figure out where you need to go next, as there are quite a few different areas in the game. Great job, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
A115SDWL5IJEQJ B00FXKHEK6 5 1384560000 20 fun game. iconic classic cartoon characters.  could not stop playing.  5 stars and hours of brain fun.will recommend to friends.
A115SDWL5IJEQJ B00D0VA0UQ 4 1375142400 25 I like that you get to decide how many pictures you need to solve the puzzled. it is fun and challenging with hours of fun.
A115SDWL5IJEQJ B00D5YT6IA 4 1372204800 22 I thought the game was fun but pretty easy since all the words were common sense.  good way to test brain function.
A115TU72IVTC9S B008KVSIT6 2 1357516800 109 I have to be honest, I didn't research this one long enough. I played with it for 10+ minutes after I bought the app before the kids saw it. I tried my best to crash as hard as possible. It looked like it showed the broken bones and total medical cost - which is fine. Unfortunately, my son was playing another time and crashed and died and there was a lot of blood - NOT OK in our household. Very disappointing. I thought there was a fun motorcycle racing game that was clean... There is enough death in our world, he doesn't need to see it on his Kindle.
A115TU72IVTC9S B00ALKKM98 5 1357516800 58 Having taught gifted students for many years, this one is one of my favorites. It is fun and engaging, and the kids don't even realize they are using logic and problem solving skills. Our 7 year olds love this as much as our 9 year old. This is my favorite one to &#34;play&#34; as well :) Great job!
A115TU72IVTC9S B00CKOYVG8 2 1370390400 74 We put this on all three of my childrens' Kindle Fires. After they pass a certain level (very early in the game), they are required to hookup to Facebook it appears. I am still investigating it. But all three kids have gotten the same message now. We don't allow our children on Facebook, so they can't play after that level. May be worth buying it for more $$ and not having the Facebook issues.
A115UTR7S7PN57 B0073U6WLG 5 1341619200 37 I love this application. I play it often when I need to relieve stress. I think the game is great and it requires hand/eye coordination and critical thinking skills. I hope you give the game a shot.
A115UTR7S7PN57 B00ARI9CDQ 5 1395273600 34 This is a fantastic way to get your news. I live in America but I chose to receive the British news. I sync it to my kindle and read it when I am offline.
A115XEA28N6ZJV B008LXN9II 5 1342656000 26 The full version of Emma is a nice game but I am most excited about the other game demos included.  The Aladdin one looks really cool!
A115XEA28N6ZJV B00701L5XS 5 1342569600 29 We have a hammock in the back yard and the first knot e used came undone.  Now we can find the proper type of knot to use for thism
A1160DG2MSIMME B007TKT2SK 5 1369008000 97 This appears to be a great app. I wish the developer would kindly let us know why the app needs access to the internet. Ads to support the developer are understandable. But it's the unknown that bothers me.Update: May 20, 2013The developer contacted me almost immediately with the fact that the app actually was not supposed to have network access.  He indicated he will remove network access in an update within a few days. In that the app is quite innovative, works well and the developer is very responsive I'm am increasing my rating to 5 stars.
A1160DG2MSIMME B00GT67UUM 2 1388361600 69 Whenever I see &#34;internet access&#34; in a game the hair on the back of my neck stands up. This alone is not necessarily a bad thing as there may be a legitimate reason for a game to have internet access.  But couple that with &#34;in app billing and purchases&#34; and it becomes a bit much.  The game looks like it may be fun but I'll pass for these reasons.
A1160DG2MSIMME B007FJFDXS 1 1356652800 105 I actually ordered this app and began to download it but changed my mind.  One of the permissions is 'Open Network Sockets'. I usually don't download apps that have that permission but was going to give this one a try.  Seeing 'Full Internet Access' again as a permission in the download process just made me feel uneasy.  Especially since the developer didn't explain why the app needed internet access.  I see no need for the app to be able to access the internet any time it likes. This is the only reason the app gets 1 star.  It may very well be a great game.
A1160DG2MSIMME B008J8OH5O 1 1357603200 83 I wish the developers would explain why their apps need internet access.  The description indicates the app is "ad free" which is good, however why does the app need internet access?  Any app requiring internet access while the app is running should have an explanation why. And how do we know it is not accessing the internet when it is NOT running?  The 1 star rating is not indicative of how good the app is. It may very well be a great game.
A1160DG2MSIMME B00701L5XS 1 1342569600 32 App force closes &amp; caused my phone to reboot.  Uninstalled and installed again but it just force closed again.  During install it lists unacceptable permissions but the Amazon listing said no permissions.
A1160DG2MSIMME B00A3LSW7Y 1 1359590400 39 This looked like it might have been a fun game to try but I wouldn't download it due to concerns about unnecessary access to my phone's state and internet access. The one star rating is based solely on permissions.
A1160DG2MSIMME B004LZF2LW 4 1333324800 149 Okay, I can perhaps understand the need for course and fine GPS locations if the app sets the time based on your location but why does it need to "open network sockets" to have internet access.  The dev should explain the need for such permissions to help us understand why a clock app wants to get on the internet.  Too much of a security breach for me.UPDATE:Dev promptly addressed my concerns over permissions and explained why app needed socket access permission.  The explaination made sense and didn't indicate anything overly malicious. I installed app and it appears to do what it says. Many options for adding clocks in different time zones and customizing them. I personally would like more widget size options but there are enough to choose from. I've not tried the alarm feature yet so I can't comment of that. I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars.
A1164DIX8JEH1E B007NZV2HK 4 1387065600 21 This game is fun but I don't like the coloring. It makes my eyes hurt after awhile. It keeps me busy.
A1164DIX8JEH1E B009O2XY12 5 1387065600 30 Fun game. This game is very entertaining. I love it and my 5 year old loves it and my 3 year old loves it. This is a great family game.
A1164DIX8JEH1E B004XWL0ZA 3 1387065600 26 This game is just alright. My 3 year old likes it but doesn't love it. It is a pretty good matching game but I've seen better.
A11677UKZPFI9S B009HKL4B8 5 1374451200 42 I love this game. Can't seem to put it down. They upgraded it a couple days ago so you can visit friend's sims.  It is nice but if your friends haven't upgraded it's not easy to complete goals. I totally recommend it!
A11677UKZPFI9S B00BXPQN2K 5 1390867200 42 I have just started playing this game but so far everything is working great. I really like it. The game is easy to understand and play. I would recommend this game for families with children. It's easy to learn and child friendly.
A11677UKZPFI9S B00E5GJ7QS 5 1385683200 26 I really like this game. It's easy to play. I like that you can pick how many cards to play. I recommend to all bingo lovers.
A116CG4I1SEVID B0066T8SDU 5 1358640000 23 This is my favorite game . I play it a lot. Keeps me thinking of words  I haven't used for awhile. Shirley Glandon
A116CG4I1SEVID B0088Y7YHW 5 1358640000 21 I don't play this one to often. It's fun tho. Good variety of games on it. Enjoy playing it. Shirley Glandon
A116CWZ5J3KXLL B00COCTAZS 5 1397433600 144 My husband and I have this game on our Fire.  We race not only with many others who are playing this game but also each other seeing who can stay ahead.  The graphics are great as are the vibrant colors.  Every so often your bet will increase, money added to your credits or to the jackpot.  It is fun to see what you will receive when you Spin the Wheel.  The Match 3 Board can be quite an interesting challenge.  If you are looking for a fun, sometimes frustrating slot machine game that most resembles what you might find in Vegas - this is it!  Give it a try.  I think you'll like it.  AND, if you happen to catch up and pass &#34;lovestoplay&#34; watch out because that's me and I will do my best to keep it from happening.  Let the games begin.
A116CWZ5J3KXLL B00H90NQG4 5 1393286400 139 You will note that I enjoy all of my slot machines.  This is because I have an exclusive few (7) that are used all the time.  If I find I don't like a machine just remove it.This is a fun filled game.  They start with a few games and add more as time goes along.  There are some games I like a lot and others not much.  So, just play the ones that you like.  But I would suggest giving all the games a try.  This is another one of those games that can keep you absorbed for a long time, or until you are out of money.  As with all the slot games, you can buy more money or just wait for it to give you more free coins.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
A116IBI2ECUG4T B004UT6RE0 4 1330646400 58 I do like this app. it gives me the ability to see everything that is running and allows me to close them all at once! although there are some apps that I still have to go the application menu and manually force quit them. if there was the ability tocsin this through the app that would be perfect.
A116IBI2ECUG4T B0073LHCCS 5 1360886400 23 This is a great puzzle game that combines crosswords with up-down words.  It really makes you think and ponder at the next clue.
A116IBI2ECUG4T B004MC8CA2 5 1337299200 29 His is the best app if you want to get your daily dose of God! It has everything from reading plans to Bible audio. I highly reccomend for ANYBODY!
A116KV6M67Z2NA B00A3WTXQ2 2 1356220800 26 Why do people like a smiling piece of jello it is a total copy of Doodle jump it makes tiny left over bubbles it is dumb
A116KV6M67Z2NA B005QT1KU4 4 1357862400 21 The graphics are great and very life like but can be hard at times.  Over all great game and worth buying.
A116KV6M67Z2NA B007PT3QOQ 1 1334102400 27 when I was downloading I could only get to 22% until it exited the game and then I could not play it that game ducks ball crap!

A116KV6M67Z2NA B004ZALKMI 1 1325808000 63 I say it is really crappy if I could give it a minouse a guzzillon! !! My little cousin ran in the bath room and camped in there till she had to leave. She told me I think there might be a hairy ball like the one on your device under my bed! I felt really bad! I HATE THAT PEICE OF CRAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A116OIMLKR39E B00DUZKE4O 4 1374624000 23 So far so good. Doesn't seem excessively difficult but still presents a challenge at times. Kudos. Would recommend as a fun time killer.
A116OIMLKR39E B00HDRTGDK 4 1393286400 21 Great game, really brings back the memories. Other times can be really frustrating. I wonder where some of it came from!
A116OIMLKR39E B00HAS1AKY 4 1404086400 24 Good brain game. Gets the wheels turning when your bored with nothing else to do. Some can be tricky though. Use your coins wisely.

A116UI9G1PGUF3 B007NACZPI 3 1332460800 25 works well cute story, makes you work for the lvls, didn't like the way things take up space or how you place things like houses.
A116UI9G1PGUF3 B005ZFOOE8 5 1335398400 77 Very nice all around all the buttons work without fail Radio stations for every major city from Anchorage Alaska to NY NY. I couldent ask for more from this app.Not only can you search for music you can also search for genres of music like Rock 80s ect. Ive had this app for close to 2 weeks and never had one problem If someone asked me if Id download it again my immediate answer would be YES!!!!
A116UI9G1PGUF3 B007KPOZK4 4 1334880000 41 A little slow loading but once its up and going its Great!!!The story is fun I didn't get bored and the people looked like real people and not blobs!Overall very nice but they need to do something. about the loading time.
A116UI9G1PGUF3 B00ALKKM98 3 1356307200 23 so very easy and have finished all the levels, the first version was great and really hard but bridges is like a cheat.
A116UI9G1PGUF3 B008XG1X18 5 1356307200 22 ever and ever and ever and ever never ever freezes and it has great look to it. Very clean look to it.
A116UI9G1PGUF3 B00AREIAI8 3 1359244800 32 Are VERY easy. Good graphics and it walks you through the steps to care for your horse in a simple easy way. It's also extremely hard to change the name of anything.
A116VJVIYJIA37 B007N5YIUS 4 1388966400 22 Bought this for my son's kindle. He said it is a lot of fun and keeps trying to get me to play.
A116VJVIYJIA37 B00FAPF5U0 5 1388966400 20 Bought this for my son's kindle. He loves it and always tries to beat his mom to a new level.
A116VJVIYJIA37 B00CKOYVG8 1 1387411200 39 My 10 year old son wanted this app for his kindle. But I bought this by mistake. I really don't want him playing others online. You cannot play this game by yourself. Had to get a different angry birds.
A116YVP2PSHCML B007ZGO7EM 5 1359504000 20 Nice big numbers!!! I love this and use it all the time.  One of the best calculators I have used.
A116YVP2PSHCML B007SYDYLS 5 1354838400 30 fun little game. the free version is kinda quick so I was glad when the full version came out as free app of the day. I got that right away.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00A11AN6O 5 1358899200 92 It works well for me on my first gen kindle fire.  I was able to upload photos on my PC and organize them into different folders on the photo cloud. I can now view and show them to others on my kindle or PC.  I have not tried to use it on my phone yet, but if it works like it does on the Kindle, I will be glad.  No more worries about lost photos.  5GB should be about 2000 photos so I am pretty sure that will be enough. Thanks Amazon.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00B5DLSMU 5 1361145600 23 very addictive. I love to play this game.  Makes my mind work.  I also like that you can play two levels at once.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00850NK6I 5 1350950400 26 works just fine on my kindle fire. once I got the adobe ID it was a piece of cake to download a book. A keeper app.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00910Y1OQ 5 1354838400 23 I play this game all the time.  It's a challenge and  a great way to waste time. LOL I just like it .
A116YVP2PSHCML B00846F1YW 4 1361145600 26 I wish I had more time for this game.  The graphics are nice and the objects are not too hard to find.  I love the storyline.
A116YVP2PSHCML B0094BB4TW 3 1348272000 24 Let me purchase it, then said to search for it in the app store on my KF.  Nowhere to be found to download it.Suggestions???
A116YVP2PSHCML B0094FYBB6 3 1359504000 26 I like the game, but cannot play most times as the app freezes on kindle fire and I have to shut it all the way down.
A116YVP2PSHCML B008BTX2CA 1 1354838400 23 I could not tell any difference in the sound whatsoever. deleted the app after a few attempts to see if it really works.
A116YVP2PSHCML B0089BPEZS 5 1354838400 21 I have never had an issue with this app. works every time. enjoy the show and pop the corn. it's on.
A116YVP2PSHCML B007SYXJXG 4 1354838400 21 sometimes it force closes, but other than that It works for my needs better than any other tv app I tried.
A116YVP2PSHCML B009XAJI8S 4 1359504000 25 i like it and it works. I can watch some tv on it, but most of the time it is shows I don't care for.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00B7KKNI6 5 1369872000 21 great way to waste and keep your mind active.  fun and fast.  I just wish I could win more often. LOL
A116YVP2PSHCML B0093QQCGI 5 1359504000 26 all the news you could ever need in a nice format to read.  I like that you can even save stories for when you are offline.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00A3E2BVE 5 1353974400 29 love this game. works great on the fire. I deleted my sideloaded one hahaha. thanks amazon for getting this game on the fire. now has that been 20 words?
A116YVP2PSHCML B0064DBE9I 4 1354838400 20 fun little piano. nice to learn new tunes. for those of us musically challenged it's a treat to use this.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004XDYJRU 3 1361145600 40 The app is fine, I just do not like that it does not have all my local stations.  Not the apps fault, they all don't stream online. Other than that it is a great app to find stations and listen.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004K4RY9M 3 1361145600 21 I just had a hard time swiping the words.  I found it rather boring for me.  Nothing wrong with the app.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004H6WTJI 5 1359504000 43 A great way to track what you are doing.  The database is amazing with all the food listings and from what I can tell they areaccurate.  I love the fact you can scan in the food using the bar code.  Pretty neat app.
A116YVP2PSHCML B006GIX2MI 3 1354838400 26 took forever to download and then was force closing, so I didn't need the bother.  I have no idea what the game would have been like.
A116YVP2PSHCML B005J80RTW 5 1361145600 31 Much like Ruzzle but I like this game because I don't have to wait for anyone to play.  I just wish you did not have to be online to play it.
A116YVP2PSHCML B00FAPF5U0 5 1387670400 32 love this game. it is so fun and challenging. I love to play this game. soooo glad it is on the kindle. thank you so much for this great and fabulous game.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004UID2LC 5 1354838400 20 I got some nice tunes using this.  I don't really use it a lot, but it still works for me.
A116YVP2PSHCML B006C4U9RW 5 1354838400 22 I like it better than Pandora, I just wish you could make your own playlist, Other than that it works for me.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004GYY714 4 1361145600 24 It's ok for me.  Does not have all the local stations, but not all of them stream online so it's not the apps fault.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004SC3BLG 5 1359504000 24 great to track things with.  I am using it now to track my exercise minutes.  works for me.  i like the calendar and graphs.
A116YVP2PSHCML B005ET78TS 5 1361145600 20 easy to use and I know where to go before I get to the airport.  Very nice layout. Great app.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004TA2F14 5 1361145600 21 easy to use and I love the scanner. My list is complete and easy to read before I leave the house.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004SIIBGU 4 1359504000 21 Nice app. I am able to go to Ebay and browse, buy or sell.  Very easy app to use. No issues.
A116YVP2PSHCML B005YH5R7A 5 1359504000 25 There is so much here.  Prayers, daily mass readings.  A great app for Catholics.  I put it on my phone and use it at Church.
A116YVP2PSHCML B004VMY62Q 3 1354838400 20 worked ok and I could find the files I just liked another app I have that I am used to.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00FELZD70 2 1393027200 143 [Reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]Tap a square to hit it with your pick axe.  Fall in the resulting hole to keep travelling downward at the same rate the screen is scrolling.  Repeat until your pickaxe breaks.  Spend your points to buy a pickaxe that will last longer.  Repeat some more.  Collect bonuses that help you find TNT to hit so you can blow up multiple bricks.  There are lots of bonuses in the cash shop and buyable characters and so on, but I just don't see the appeal.  That part's subjective, of course, but it's a game.  Fun is always subjective.At least there's no advertising, other than for its own cash shop.  There are constant reminders of things you could buy in the cash shop to dig more.It uses Amazon GameCircle for achievements and wants to connect to FaceBook for some reason.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B0087TUZII 2 1388620800 80 [Reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]The game keeps requesting Facebook and Twitter logins to share progress posts and acting like refusal to provide them is an error.  The interface demands accurate clicks on targets much smaller than my finger.  It's probably playable with a fine-tipped stylus.  The story and gameplay didn't have a chance to interest me before those annoyances turned me off.  I didn't even stick around long enough to find out how bad the in-app purchase begging gets.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00AZKXNPY 2 1397433600 440 [reviewed version 1.0.2 on Kindle Fire HDX 7]The game is basic old familiar Spider solitaire with a choice of 1, 2, 3, or 4, suits for varying difficulty.  When you tap a stack of cards, it moves the movable ones.  It also highlights runs of matching cards that can be moved together.  That's it for the good points.The interface is a bit awkward, especially when it tries to guess what you mean instead of just going by what you actually tap on and try to drag.  If you just want to tap stacks and let it more what it wants where it wants to, I suppose that's fine, but there's no option to turn off the second-guessing if that's not what you want.  There is an option to turn off the one-tap, but it doesn't prevent cards from just going whereever they want if they feel like it.  Some visual feedback of what the game thinks you mean before you let go would help.  Maybe a shadow or arrow or highlight that shows which move the game thinks you're heading for, and whether it's valid.  But they didn't do that.The controls are a minor annoyance, though.  The real problems are:- Every time you load it, you get a prompt to go buy more games from the same company.- If you leave it running, it notifies about product news related to any game published by this company.- It makes a big deal out of making sure you really want to quit, and then doesn't actually stop running so it can notify you about that product news and offer updates.- The confirmation dialogs for things like quitting the game and clearing your &#34;stats&#34; are full screens that take nearly a full second to &#34;slide&#34; into place and show another ad,- I'm already running the same version that's currently in the Amazon app store, but it still told me there was an update in the Amazon app store and suggested I update it.  I don't know what it was planning to update in that case, so I refused, and now I have to refuse that every time I load the game.It has prominent buttons for facebook, sharing, buying other games from the same company, and ads for other games from the same company, all cluttering the main menu.  The main menu is quite a mess for only having two buttons that are even related to this game - play and settings.  Oh yeah, &#34;stats&#34; too.  They're not labeled and most of them don't even do anything but generate &#34;External Market Links Disabled&#34; errors.Overall, I'd rather have my old Windows 98 &#34;Patience&#34; spider solitaire.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00BNH81FU 4 1397865600 762 [reviewed version 1.0.3 on Kindle Fire HDX 7]This cookbook app has most, but not all, of the features I'm looking for, few ads, and no major flaws.  The recipes are from Better Homes and Gardens as opposed to the arbitrary but unlimited open online sources you'd get by just Googling a recipe.  That means a respected source is controlling both the quality and the supply of recipes.  You can buy additional &#34;chapters&#34; of 101 recipes each for $0.99.  You can make your own notes after a recipe's instructions, but you can't edit it or add your own recipes or import them from other sources.The search and filter options for finding recipes are adequate, though the Search is a bit hidden in the app menu instead of right on the recipes list like Filter is.  There are plenty of categories available, some for free, some for an additional $0.99 purchase.  There are a fair number of features to filter by, and they're determined by the category, such as the category &#34;Breads&#34; having filters for muffins, quick breads, yeast breads, and biscuits.  Additional filters for any category include healthy, fast, low fat, and editor's picks.  The search function finds recipes that include whatever word(s) you type, whether it's in the name, ingredients, or instructions.Recipes are shown with two views, first a good sized photo, time summary, and scrolling ingredients list, then the instructions.  You have to tap the &#34;Ingredients&#34; and &#34;Steps&#34; buttons to switch back and forth.  To cook that way, you'll want to measure everything out and set it all out before you start cooking, like they do on cooking shows.  Not everyone cooks that way, but it's not unreasonable.  You can even use the &#34;Shopping List&#34; feature to make a quick checklist of all the ingredients and quantities, go down the list and check them off, then return to the recipe and follow the instructions.There are three text sizes available for the recipe view, small, medium, and large.  On my 7&#34; tablet, large was adequate for me to read from a couple feet away while cooking, but more sizes, or a &#34;pinch&#34; scaling option, would have been nicer.  Speaking of scaling, the function to apply a multiplier to the quantities is also lacking.Recipes can be Shared to email, facebook, twitter, or other apps, such as other recipe book apps that actually allow you to edit.  You can keep multiple Favorites lists, such as things to try and things you've already tried and liked.  The Shopping Cart function adds all the ingredients from a recipe with two taps, including quantites, and sorts them by type.  You can also manually add items to the shopping list and share the list to email or, presumably, other appropriate apps.  I guess I just don't have any compatible apps to try that with.One caveat for the shopping lists - the default one, &#34;My shopping list&#34;, is not deletable.  It's the easiest one to add to, but items can only be removed from it one at a time, or at least selected one at a time to delete.  If you're making a list to just use once, make a new temporary one, so you can delete the whole list when you're done.  The permanent list is fine if you're actually using it to shop and will want to buy the same quantities of the same ingredients every week.  Unfortunately, like many shopping lists, there's no option to change the quantity without removing the item and adding it again manually.  That rather limits the usefulness of a permanent shopping list.One other nice feature is the &#34;tip&#34; hyperlinks on various ingredients and steps.  From how to separate egg whites from yolks to how to snip fresh cilantro with scissors in a measuring cup, there are lots of useful little bits in there.  Some are just a typed paragraph, some are a magazine-like article, and some are videos.The advertising is limited to Better Homes and Gardens products, both the magazine and the add-on recipes for this app, and it's a quite tolerable level.  There is no nagging to upgrade or begging to be connected to social media.  The app exits cleanly and loads quickly.All in all, it's pretty good, and I'll be keeping it installed, but the fact that I can only use it for BHG's own recipes, not mine, or anything I've found anywhere else, makes it more of a resource than a tool.  Potentially useful, but not what I'm looking for.  If you're looking for the recipe resource, not the cookbook app, maybe this is exactly what you want.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B0063IH60K 2 1388620800 39 [Reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]Decent implementation of classic "Klondike" solitaire, but it displays full screen ads when dealing a new game.  A few options for table and card pictures, including custom images, but not worth the annoying ads.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B0085E2LFA 3 1396915200 596 [reviewed version 1.0.2 on Kindle Fire HDX 7]There's a plethora of color matching games out there that remove circles from a grid when you match up patterns of the same color.  This one has seven variations of that theme, good graphics and pleasant sounds, and isn't /too/ annoying with its advertising.The bubbles are just circles, but they're animated with an underwater theme.  When bubbles pop, the nearby bubbles move away in a wave and settle back and higher bubbles float down smoothly.  You can turn off the wave effect on the main menu if it annoys you.  The background is similarly animated in an aquatic theme, but not enough to be distracting.The seven game modes  have different rules, scoring, power-ups, etc., but all are based on the same bubbles and all give bonus points for popping certain patterns of bubbles, like squares, straight lines, stairs, and tees, and multipliers for consecutive patterns.- &#34;Classic&#34; - there are a limited number of bubbles and you just pop them until there are no matching groups left to pop- &#34;Bubble Shootix&#34; - bubbles are hanging from the top of the screen and you shoot one bubble at a time up from the bottom to match and pop and knock the hanging bubbles down.- &#34;Turn by Turn&#34; - like Classic, but you take turns playing against your device.  If you match a bonus pattern, you get to take another turn.- &#34;Gravity&#34; - like Classic, but when you turn your device, it readjusts gravity to match, so you can make better matches by letting the bubbles settle into a different arrangement.- &#34;Bubble Invasion&#34; - a cross between Classic and Tetris.  Clusters of bubbles fall down the screen and settle, and you have to keep popping matching groups of them to keep any column from building up to the top of the screen.- &#34;Chill Out&#34; - like Classic, but the bubbles are unlimited.  No matter how many you pop, more will just pour in to replace them.  It would be pretty unlikely to ever run out of possible matches, but the game keeps score anyway, just to see how long you keep going.- &#34;Critical Mass&#34; - normal bubbles are interspersed with &#34;nuke&#34; bubbles that are not poppable, but will pop themselves if they form a large enough group or form a bonus shape.  Gravity is also variable, like the Gravity mode, so you can use that to try to pop the nuclear bubbles.There is a small rotating ad permanently in the top left corner and a &#34;Remove Ads&#34; button on the main menu that directs you to in-app purchasing to buy the full version.  The free version doesn't seem to be limited or lacking features or bonuses.  It just has that ad.Also on the main menu, there are prominent buttons for Game Circle (friends, achievements, and leaderboards), developer info, Facebook, and a link to the developer's other games on Amazon, but they're just buttons.  Easy to ignore if you so choose.  There is also a flashing button for in-app purchases.  Of course, it doesn't tell you that's what it is until you click it.  It just says &#34;pearls store&#34;, with &#34;pearls&#34; being the points you earn in the game and spend on powerups.  The button in the main menu isn't to spend pearls on powerups, though.  It's to buy more pearls with cash.  Personally, I don't see the point, since they're eared by playing anyway.Overall, it's mildly pleasing, but not all that entertaining.  It's just not a kind of game I really enjoy.  It also has it's mild annoyances, but they're not intrusive.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00HFTHXMC 2 1395360000 450 [reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]It's a standard game of throwing a marble (or &#34;bubble&#34; in this case) from the bottom center to stick to clinging bubbles at the top and match the colors to make them fall down.  There are lots of games like that available, many for free.  This particular example has better than average graphics, a nice bonus system, decent challenge, good controls, and pleasant sound.  It could have been a great game if they'd just stopped there.It apparently integrates  with a FaceBook version of the game, but I haven't tried that part.  Whether that is a benefit or an annoyance depends on whether you have a FaceBook and want to connect this game to it.  If you don't, it will keep nagging you to do so anyway.  There's no &#34;I don't use FaceBook&#34; option.  There are also an array of useful things to buy with &#34;gems&#34;, which are sold as in-app cash purchases.  The array of colorizers that could change the color of your bubble from one you can't possibly match and will definitely lost your bonuses if you use to one that you need to drop the &#34;Pandora's Box&#34; and win the level, is always displayed at the side of the screen and even glows sometimes.  And, of course, it costs those gems to use it.  There are also full screen ads for other games that come up every time you start this one.  In addition to all these annoyances, there are many worrying permissions granted to this game.  Even if it wasn't connected to FaceBook, I wouldn't want any game, especially not a simple bubble puzzle, to have all those permissions.  I certainly don't want to also give that information to FaceBook.I find the Amazon GameCircle integration incredibly annoying, but maybe that's just me.  There's just no need to cover the  &#34;continue to next level&#34; button with a &#34;You beat your last high score by completing this level&#34; notice every single time.  I also don't care for the whole system of keeping Amazon informed about all of my gaming habits on a level by level basis.The controls are better than I've seen in other, similar games.  You can either tap where you want to aim your bubble, drag  your finger to draw a line projecting the path of the bubble (not including bounces) or turn the projecting line from below, so you can see the whole play field while you're aiming, without your hand in the way.The game itself is good, it plays well, it looks and sounds good, and it's fun, if a bit more simple than I prefer.  It's just not worth the annoying extra FaceBook, cash shop, advertizing, and especially permissions.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00BUB9JDW 2 1401148800 242 [reviewed version 2.9 on Kindle Fire HDX 7]It's a pretty, relaxing game, and is even fun for a few minutes.  Unfortunately, only the first set of levels and &#34;Zen Mode&#34; are free, and until you make an in-app purchase, there are full screen ads between levels.  You can unlock levels by spending the same coins you are frequently prompted to spend on power-ups instead, but it rapidly gets harder to earn more of those.The list of permissions should warn off most players who bother to read them.  Most of these things are permissions a game like this has no business requesting and could only be using for advertising, data collection, and analytics.  I don't mind if you analyse my usage of your own app, but you do not need to know what else I'm running.  Previous versions of this &#34;game&#34; failed to properly install, but were playable, so they consistently reinstalled themselves every time the device updated its apps or booted, until I logged in from my PC to remove Pearls from both my device and my cloud.  This current version is slightly better behaved, but still does not exit cleanly and remains running in the background, probably still running its analytics.  Occasionally, those background processes interrupt other apps by announcing &#34;Pearls&#34; had crashed, repeatedly.It's a nice little game, relaxing and attractive and easy, but it's not worth paying for in spyware, advertising, in-app purchases, or intrusive, unstable, and undisclosed background analytics.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B008K6HN8I 5 1393027200 99 [Reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]This is the most useful utility I've added to my Kindle Fire HDX so far.  I use it to access files on my PC remotely as well as manipulate stored files on the Kindle, like one would with Windows Explorer on the PC.  I'm actually rather surprised something like this didn't come with the Kindle by default, but since it didn't, here it is.  There's no advertising, no nagging, no tricks or gimmicks, just a very useful little utility.  It's not especially pretty, and some of the buttons could be bigger, but it works.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B00EUCL6R0 4 1392163200 324 [Reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]Very playable for free, though buying gold will allow you to play more (more energy capacity, instant energy refills) and use equipment above your level, among other things.  You can definitely buy power, but the main story line doesn't require it as far as I've seen (level 24).  You can also buy better than normal equipment with valor points earned in guild raids on various dungeons.  If you're not in a guild, you can still join a raid as a mercenary.  There's even a quick button to just let the game pick an available raid for you.  You just have to pick the dungeon first.The quests are typical "kill X goblins" and "retrieve Y ears" fare.  The story is standard "return of dead dread overlord" and "the ratmen and zombies and invading" tropes.  And of course, you are "the only one" who can "save the world" again.  Never mind the thousand other "only one"s camped outside, raiding those dungeons in scores.  Travel is just scrolling around a map and tapping on your destination.  The graphics are mostly static images: maps, location backgrounds, shop menus, cards depicting your enemies, a paper doll of your character (at home or on character sheet, not in combat) with equipment optional.  Spell and attack effects shown hitting or coming from the monsters are animated.  There is some limited crafting and enchanting, but as of level 22, I've only just learned how and only done what the quests to enable them required.The good part is the tactical combat.  Instead of simply taking turns, each action, yours and your enemies', takes a specific amount of time to complete.  You can see what they're doing and how much longer before it happens and choose your action accordingly.  Defending at the right time or interrupting a powerful attack can be just as important as finishing your own power attack.All in all, it's good for a free mobile game.
A116ZSMZRT9RUN B004XQYBA2 4 1400025600 355 [reviewed version 3.3.0 on Kindle Fire HDX 7]I got this as a Free App of the Day, but it's worth the purchase if you're not overly suspicious of games that require network access for no apparent reason and don't stop running when you close them.  Even with that moderately suspicious activity, it's the best Sudoku app I've tried yet.There are lots of options for usability, compatibility, and help.  It can provide hints using a variety of metrics.  It has buttons to pencil in possibilities and an option to pencil in all non-conflicting possibilities for you when you start each new puzzle.  Personally, I think that makes it too easy, but I do like the optional default where it clears the pencil marks that conflict with anything you pen in, so you can quickly see what you have solved.  There are really too many options to list, but there is a free version if you want to try before you buy.There is no advertising, no in-app purchasing, no connecting to social media, just an easy to play and very configurable Sudoku game.  There is a button linking to the developer's other games, but it's pretty unobtrusive.  Of course, how easy each puzzle is to solve is a different matter.  I didn't have any trouble with the first few Easy puzzles I tried, so I went for a Moderate one, and it took me a while.  Seems like a good range of difficulty to me, but that's subjective.My only concern is that it wants network access for no apparent reason and doesn't close cleanly on exit.  That's probably due to the advertising code other users have mentioned, which is probably reporting more than just its own usage statistics if it doesn't stop when you close the app.  At least it doesn't require any really invasive permissions, so the information it could be snooping on is limited.  I would expect that and more in the free version, but this is a paid app, so it loses a star.  You can force close the app or turn off your device when you're done playing if you're worried about it.
A1171E8AVEINC6 B00CEBKMN8 5 1374883200 24 I love this game.it keeps you going.you don't get bored.easy to level up.my kids love it as well.would tell any one to get it.

A1177UM954D9XG B00I8Q77Y0 3 1395619200 45 This game is almost exactly like flappy bird. I mean,I'm not complaining , but at the very least they should make the tubes draws or trees or something instead of the Mario tubes. But I like it and I like when the bird poops! :)
A1179Y4O5W62WS B0054JZC6E 5 1334102400 21 I love this app it had a whole bunch of games the games are awesome! u should get it this app

A117AW6STO9CZN B006HXXJH0 5 1373155200 29 I love Mahjong and this one is the best yet.  Ya have several levels and adventures.  I love this game. I recommend this one to everyone that loves Mahjong.
A117AW6STO9CZN B00BWBHIUG 5 1373155200 35 I love the movie and love the game.  It keeps the little ones entertained for hours.  Gotta love that.  It has great graphics, adventures, colorful, awesome.  I recommend this one to all who love Nemo

A117GXV7XBFNHC B00AR83PN4 1 1375401600 23 I only had this app for a couple of hours to difficult to get used to.  Defiantly geared to more computer savy participants.
A117GXV7XBFNHC B00CGPPMKU 3 1375401600 24 I liked this app, but I just could not figure out how to get the designs I made onto my kindle as a wallpaper
A117GXV7XBFNHC B00B5KHZA2 4 1375401600 26 I like hidden object games but after awhile you need a change.  This one was very good sometimes I had a hard time finding the objects
A117HPH4I6E9VA B005ZXWMUS 5 1393977600 22 I love taking my kidle with me where ever I go not being bored in dr offices . neither are the patients
A117HPH4I6E9VA B00CKW6FVE 5 1402358400 28 Ih ave a game boy with tetriss on it  but its black an white I never stopped playing it in the past .. matter affact I still have
A117I3R5R5N6G B006D1ONE4 5 1332288000 33 Very fun and wildy engaging.  The sfx, the music, the zany gator...and it has challenging levels and bonus thingies to catch.  Overall, a wonderful game...good job disney i forgive you for john carter
A117I3R5R5N6G B005J0VPNC 4 1315267200 34 Worth a dollar, sure.  But I dont think the app is astounding.  It makes some pics look pretty artsy and cool...some look meh...then again im not much a photographer so what do I know
A117I3R5R5N6G B0058VW36U 4 1309478400 23 Bought it before went free, worth the purchase and a entertaining game.  Really hard to not like it if youre into puzzle games.
A117I3R5R5N6G B004GFN11A 5 1312156800 24 Maybe the real wordpress fulfills others&apos; needs but for me, simple typing posts is fine and I love how convenient and easy it is.
A117I3R5R5N6G B0051UP5NQ 5 1319587200 54 Free!?  Now all I need is a keyboard and my samsung tablet will replace a laptop!  Looks solid, feels solid.  I will enjoy doing school work without trying to snag a campus computer.  No doubt it isn't the real deal but who cares, if it opens docs, emails docs, and saves docs i'm good!
A117JV3IY7S0PY B004O3YGMC 5 1325808000 81 The pro version has 128 bit encryption. With the streamer client, one has access to all connected pc, desktop or laptop, wired or wireless from a mobile device or even a pc. Very useful for media streaming of audio and  video files. In fact I am able to play  blu ray disks and 1080p video on my 1024x768 tablet at the moment. The more I play with this app, the more I see the power and potential. Love it, thanks Amazon!!
A117JV3IY7S0PY B004GBARY8 5 1319414400 66 Excellent app with fancy artwork and animation, now I'm looking forward to receiving an update on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year!One wish that will help me a lot is to come up with an overlay instead of a wallpaper that can be adjusted for transparency just like Windows Aero. At least it will still let me view my clock background. Thanks to the author/s and Amazon!
A117JV3IY7S0PY B005F11PEY 1 1312416000 41 If you have an LG Optimus V, don&apos;t even think about it. While installing it will boot your phone and there will be no balls to play. The same thing can be said about the newbie who created this awful mess.
A117JV3IY7S0PY B0055S348W 5 1316131200 205 Printershare is a file based app that sends its rendered pages to a printer via a wifi or bluetooth network.This app will be a lot more functional if it also installs as a printer device which can communicate with the apps. My initial experience is exclusively printing pdf files, the app really works as advertized with no additional functionality such as reformatting the content or deleting the graphics. Herewith as some of the pointers/wishes that I've come up with:Installation:1. Install printershare.2. Wifi/bluetooth sharing, turn on wifi/bluetooth and printer.3. Run printershare. Select nearby printing via wifi/bluetooth.4. Printershare finds your printer and will need to download the driver.5. Files to be printed are all located in the sd folders. Printershare will show all the contents of the folders.6. PDF files will require download of rendering software.Observations/wish list:1. Files can be previewed before printing.2. Pages can be selectively printed.3. No option for directly sending files to printer.4. No option to run in the background to print screen.5. No running service feature.6. Apps cannot send data directly to printershare. It must be able to create and store the data in the sd card first.7. Android 2.2 does not have a printer entity that can be linked to all apps.
A117JV3IY7S0PY B004DPIEF6 5 1319673600 84 I definitely need this app as a watch dog on Halloween Day. If it detects the number of gremlins at my door hollering "Trick or Treat" then I'd be a firm believer of the paranormal. Be nice if it can create a video of the activity, that would at least provide a record of what happened. I encourage the devs to keep up the good work and investigate another app that will sense UFOs so I can start taking pictures and videos. Thanks Amazon!
A117JV3IY7S0PY B004WPKENW 1 1316217600 27 This may be an excellent game but unless the author makes an effort to cover most popular devices it will not receive the best reviews. Try again!
A117JV3IY7S0PY B004XNGKBS 5 1317081600 57 Using a virtual pen that follows the touch strokes is a great idea but there should be an option to make the pen tip visible for better control. This app has potential for further development into the realm of handwriting recognition, handwriting analysis, graphics and cad apps for tablets. Keep up the good work and thanks Amazon!
A117JV3IY7S0PY B004T3K50E 5 1319328000 83 I like this game, it's both entertaining and fun. It's not fast enough like an arcade action game that requires a power hungry processor so it saves the battery at the same time. I'd like to see more these RPGs, specially in the historical category that educates the uninformed like me. Would be amusing to play the role of good and bad guys, like Gadhaffi for one. May even work out as a conflict between two or more gamers online, just my thoughts.
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00CF6J2G0 5 1382140800 47 Such is the Magic Farm...an interesting plot with a lot of strategy=a lot of fun. Graphics are well done the plot has kept me going for hours on weekends. Kudos to whoever created this app. I will search their website to see what else they have &quot;interesting&quot;!
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B009GFCVNO 5 1371859200 21 Awesome game....realistic results...clear animations...Will take a little while to master the batting swing,but I had that problem in high school.  8D
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00G5LQ5MU 5 1388188800 50 I have played about 6 different versions of escaping the Titanic...this is the first for the Kindle and I am pleased with the graphics. In the first scene I had to actually MOVE the people out of the way! An interesting way to play. Great game, I rated it 5*
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00IYAG7DM 5 1397001600 31 COMBINING TWO GENRES of games...Rpg and Trading cards makes this a different game. Plus you can combine, enchant cards puts it in a rare class. A must have for your tablet.
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00FAPF5U0 5 1383004800 23 Many challenges-plenty of strategy needed and a little bit of luck makes this a great App!!!!Wonder if there will be a sequel.....just saying
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00AMPALV6 4 1388188800 50 When I first saw this App, I confess I had my doubts. After reading the reviews, took a chance. Suffice to say, this was a great choice! The different activities make it all worthwhile. Now I play this about an hour a day, seven days a week!!! 'Muff said. 8D
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00EZWPFW2 5 1380067200 90 At first I thought this would be just a collection of riddles from Real Easy to Hard. Then I started playing it! The riddles are by themselves real good posers; others were very simple, some had me thinking for about 10 minutes!!! The &#34;scoring&#34; system is also unique (to me), allowing me to collect to &#34;pay&#34; to get to the  next level. Wonder what the &#34;last&#34; level's like?All in all, a nice way to spend an hour exercising the mind. Definitely one of my top 10 on my Kindle Fire
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00BTL5YMI 5 1391299200 21 Great how they utilized their favorite games from the slot combinations...addictive plus great animations make this a must for anyone's collection
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B008Y2FRFO 4 1380067200 78 In my youth, teenage, and now adult existence, I NEVER played those coin fountains, did not see the fun of it (plus the prizes were kind of skimpy). Now I see that there is SOME strategy in dropping the coin(s). The prizes are fun, and I don't have to spend real money!! Adding the rare puzzle piece and this has become an addictive game to play, one that doesn't make me &#34;doze&#34; (sorry, had to say it) off.
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00J05XSGY 5 1400457600 54 ...to  a maddenlingly fun adding puzzle. Simple to learn, hard to master ( I know, an ancient cliche but perfectly suited here)The closest I've added to is 1024, so I have a ways to go to solve it.(Now i take a sip of my drink, puff my cigar, and back to doing my sums!!!!!)
A117KCFQ6LY4PM B00FPYJLCY 5 1385769600 43 Nice graphics...many options...fun app to play. For the price I paid, this is a nice way to spend an hour...or two. It also ties in to other apps in that you could win coins, bucks...plus bonus spins and game. Like the title says.......
A117M7EK15PX98 B00BUR9KJE 5 1385596800 43 One of my favorite games!  Plays just like the real thing - and you can play against only yourself, or up to three others.  Have it on my Kindle Fire - fantastic on planes, in the airport, or wherever you have to wait.
A117M7EK15PX98 B00AB7HESI 5 1401926400 32 Purchased for almost 8 year old.  Absolutely loves it!  I was impressed in that correct spelling is necessary to this game.  Fascinating to watch - I am not that good at it.
A117M7EK15PX98 B009UX2YAC 5 1395360000 68 Have 7-year-old grandkids who absolutely love this game and are very good at it.  As an &#34;older&#34; person, I do not have the dexterity to play it WELL, but enjoy playing it.  It is fast-moving, has lots of rewards, yet is not super easy.  The graphics are very colorful and easy to identify what is what.  Works better on a Kindle than a smartphone, largely due to size.
A117NG2PKWPUE8 B006R8GK2Q 4 1343347200 21 My kids loved this game. It is similar classic game as i-spy. Very entertaining and different. Thank you and great job!
A117NG2PKWPUE8 B00BMNM4H6 4 1379462400 23 A unique game with it's own flavor! A game that would be great for a phone with a stylus like the GN 2!
A117NG2PKWPUE8 B007KQ6XYY 5 1370736000 22 Great game! Very challenging, fun, and addictive! Levels could get pretty difficult at times but at the same time, manageable! Thank you!
A117NLQ5NY51DA B006E6NWTK 5 1367366400 36 I've tried other ones but I love this one. I just wish the deluxe version was available here on Amazon for my kindle fire hd. I hope they will get the deluxe version on here soon.
A117NLQ5NY51DA B00BW5K5DO 5 1365033600 55 This is a fun cool game. Easy to play and challenging. I enjoy playing it. I love the graphics on my kindle, it makes it so much more fun to play a game! If your into games that are interesting I have several from Playrix LLC and I enjoy them all. They have good games.
A117NLQ5NY51DA B0093QQAEM 5 1403136000 39 This is better than I expected. Love the variety of different things to look at besides the movies and shows. Especially the comics and game pages. Love all the movies too!! Look forward to the upcoming Charlie Chaplin movies...
A117NLQ5NY51DA B005TBWN0K 5 1377043200 74 This is such an awesome app by itself, or made even better as a companion app to evernote. I use it a lot to take screen shots of web pages on my kindle fire. Your on a web page just share it with skitch, tap the snap button and your ready to mark on it, as maybe a map, or you can crop it, any number of things, then save it! It's a snap!
A117NLQ5NY51DA B00FN811SY 5 1391731200 49 I was never happier when they got this on Amazon for my kindle!!  Now I'm waiting for the update they did on the iPhone app to be on here, with the Daily text and song book added. I love having it on my iPhone and kindle very convenient. =)
A117NLQ5NY51DA B004LOMB2Q 5 1380240000 183 This app is so versatile, I love it. I even have it as an app on my Google chrome and on my HTC phone. That way everything is synced. I love using the web clipper on my Google chrome too for evernote. I also use Catch notes. Would like evernote better if they would do their note selections horizontal rather than vertical. It just feels odd sliding it side ways on my kindle. As there isn't really enough room to see them right. Other than that it's great. My wish, if evernote could look more like catch notes, and they would all sync together. But I love all my note apps, and I'm happy. I also use skitch with it. All their apps are great to use together, or by themselves. I love the colors of their apps too, that is a main reason I chose them. Not like ones that are blue or other boring colors. Or that have tiny fonts you can't read. I would like to change to different fonts in evernote. Maybe some day they'll let you do that.
A117NLQ5NY51DA B00B7AIZOA 5 1362528000 43 As an artist, it is better than any other apps I've tried for drawing/sketching my ideas. I absolutely love the video feature, its awesome seeing it draw it again. If you sketch or draw do yourself a favor and download this app!! :)
A117NLQ5NY51DA B00B29PJGS 5 1378944000 129 I LOVE Streampunk!! Having said that I love word finds too. This is a combo of two of my favorites. I got this as free app of the day and would have paid for it gladly. My other word hunts are getting replaced with this one!! This is one of the most awesome apps ever!! I love it when you finish a puzzle all the letters fall off the board and there are endless ways to play. Love the lay out and everything about this app. I have another Streampunk game I love, Howler that was a free app of the day a while back. I love this genre and look, I'm hoping more apps will have this look to them. Very happy!! Keep up the good work Dev!!
A117NLQ5NY51DA B0091SUMB4 5 1374278400 127 The developer is right, if your device is already optimized then this will not work. My kindle fire hd 8.9 was dropping WiFi signal, or if it had signal was about two or three bars if it was a good day. My kindle isn't even a year old so it cannot be having problems. So I tried this, and yes, I now have four bars of signal. And I'm happy about it. You do not need to donate if you don't want to, it's free what is it going to hurt to use it once? It sure helped and I'm glad I tried it. It's not a scam, if it was there would be no free version, they would just take your money and give you nothing.
A117OHB6MWGJTE B004XWL0ZA 5 1323475200 30 Thank you for this game. My two year old loves playing and will finish two or three rounds in a sitting.  Perfect animation feedback, and the animals are so cute.
A117OHB6MWGJTE B008IJT0CE 5 1354320000 25 We listen to through every night to help us sleep.  I bought the app to ensure I was supporting continued development of such fine products!
A117OHB6MWGJTE B004VMVTNU 5 1359590400 27 I was at the PayPal hackathon meetup when they wrote the prototype for this app... I now have harp music wake me up every morning... love it!
A117OHB6MWGJTE B008IJTFYW 5 1344902400 38 I use this app every night to drift asleep.  So much fun to experiment with mixing sounds.  I like ocean, white noise, and Kitty purring... and all volumes can be changed for just the right level of each.
A117OHB6MWGJTE B004GYY714 5 1373328000 21 I was searching for my favorite independent radio station on my Kindle and Voila! there it was!  Great job, TuneIn Radio!
A117RBVCW03LP0 B00CO4KGYA 4 1378080000 119 &quot;Tennis In the Face&quot; is a fun yet exciting game.Yet,not addicting.It is a resemblance of &quot;Stupid Zombies&quot; Yet using Tennis Balls.I like how the game as a nice beginning story and tutorial,but lacks the great set up like Cut The Rope,Angry Birds,Ect. The cartoon style along with the great graphics sets a wonderful attitude for the game.The Characters go along with the story VERY well.I still suggest a few smite changes for this game.I don't think it deserved free app of the day.But it is,what it is!Over all it is a good app.I recommend 10 and up...It is a bit TOO...just not suitable for under that age.The characters are set for higher age groups.Over all!A good app!I recommend it!
A117RBVCW03LP0 B006OCM0G0 5 1378080000 31 I have been a player of Team Lava for a year now.I have played Fashion Story,Bakery Story,Farm story,And Pet Story.Now Restaurant Story!These games are QUITE amazing and pretty addicting.!I recommend them!
A117RBVCW03LP0 B00G357N92 5 1388275200 38 This is very time consuming , but very entertaining . The time flies by fast while playing ! Great for road trips ! I bought the full version . WHICH i also HIGHLY recommend ! Its amazing !
A117SBSBK8BESS B007Z4AKQI 2 1361232000 57 The graphics are good but there is no control over the gun.  No matter how much one tries to put it on target the gun it floats all over.  Hitting an animal is pure chance.  My son and grandson both tried it and thought it was no fun.  Both are hunters.  So I uninstalled it.  Very disapointed.
A117SBSBK8BESS B0061S5NNO 4 1362009600 21 Good for keeping track of eating, weight, exercise, etc.  I have this app and it helps to keep you on target.
A117SBSBK8BESS B004SYIA1U 5 1362009600 20 I enjoy a lot of these radio programs from my youth...before TV they were familiar evening fare.  Lots of fun.
A117SBSBK8BESS B004YL208Q 5 1362009600 53 My son told me about this app and I have used it quite a few times.  At night when one doesn't want turn on a light this is perfect to give enough light to see where you're going.  Also use it when coming in from the car as we don't have street lights.
A117SBSBK8BESS B007SYWFRM 3 1362009600 41 Had this on my Kindle for my granddaughter but she was so good and had so much stuff on it my Kindle couldn't handle all the space (memory) so had to get her her own Kindle and get it off mine.
A117SBSBK8BESS B008K3OOJM 5 1352678400 58 it's fun to play but my granddaughter is better at it than I am. seems a long time to build credit to improve the tank. I check if I wake up in the middle of the night to see if my eggs have hatched. how addicting is that?!  An interesting way to learn about all the beautiful fish.
A117TBLZKE5PJT B0087TQYUG 5 1345420800 22 Fun game if you LOVE playing with words. better than playing scrabble! it's like the game boggle. Very good interface and user-friendly.
A117TBLZKE5PJT B0061RRV62 5 1345420800 28 Actually I do not like this game. But after downloading and playing it on kindle, I started to LOVE it! Plus: Has music options n stuff. Minus: Nothing!
A117TBLZKE5PJT B004VOJT0I 3 1345420800 39 I like the fun shake n spin and the interface of this app. BUT! I am always unable to view the popular recipes as it OFTEN says "AllRecipes has stopped" whenever i try to load a popular recipe :(
A117TBLZKE5PJT B008IJTFYW 4 1345420800 92 Ive got a four month old baby and whenever she has a problem sleeping, I'd play this and she would quickly get soothed and sleep in her cot. Her fav combination is lullaby, night and chimes! The other thing is that you can compose ur own music for different ambiences and add them to ur favouites list! The only disadvantage is that I could not (maybe dont know how)  to go back and perform another app or do another task on kindle. Whenever I go back, this app will automatically stop :(
A117X7PIFMBVIK B00E8KLWB4 2 1392249600 41 I'm sorry I have to give The Secret Society-Hidden Mystery such a low rating, but I can't see the scenes without using a magnification glassI loved this type of game, but my vision just isn't good enough to play this one.
A117X7PIFMBVIK B0066TUXU6 5 1400889600 22 I chose the five star rating because I'm able to catch up on my favorite shows or re-watch what shows I love.
A117X7PIFMBVIK B004HE5TAG 3 1393632000 26 Standard Blackjack game that you can play without eye-strain. Just like being at the Blackjack table without the stress.I like to play while waiting for appointments.
A117Z40YL193XM B009PSV1HE 5 1351900800 52 Diner Dash has always been my favorite game and I have been trying to find it on Amazon for two months now. So glad I found it for the kindle, finally! Its a great app and doesn't require money for everything like some apps do. c: I highly recommend this app! ;D
A117Z40YL193XM B004K56MNU 5 1370908800 28 I love this app. Its a great way to read the stories without having a computer on my lap. I recommend this for any wattpad user!My username- www.wattpad.com/ch12123
A1180F0CI8U9X3 B008N02WZU 3 1356825600 82 I know its not relevant to app performance but if your going to make money in the android ecosystem you should take the time to make new pics with something other than an Apple product. What that says to us is this &quot; I made this app for iOS and now ported it over to your crappy android OS and its not worth the time to make new pics. They won't notice!&quot;We are not second class to apple and we are noticing.
A1180F0CI8U9X3 B0066T8M1I 4 1327363200 53 The game plays well and looks great but you cannot see how much money the yellow player has because the white letters are on top of the bright yellow background. DRIVES ME NUTS. I like the game but on a HD screen I should be able to read the damn thing. FIX IT.
A1180F0CI8U9X3 B007N5YIOO 4 1332547200 51 First off I like it and recommend the ad free version to all. I have android 4 on my phone and it has an issue with this game the screen goes black at random times for no reason. only in this game. fix that asap for the people on ICS. Gnex.
A1180F0CI8U9X3 B0052UZIFA 1 1330128000 58 THIS IS GARBAGE AND LAZY PROGRAMMING. where is the info on what this update did other than erase all my stuff? no good popcap. there is no excuse for a game update to erase all my user info and game progress. what it means is you don't care at all about your customers- all you want it numbers.
A1180R2ZFDBWMC B00GINENG0 1 1388534400 35 I didn't realize I had to spend money for everything you do with this app.  I removed it from my Kindle before the child I babysit for had a chance to run up a bill...lol
A1180R2ZFDBWMC B00ALKKM98 5 1385337600 24 Love this challenging game.  It's a step up from the free flow and the upper levels are really difficult.  I really enjoy this game.
A1180R2ZFDBWMC B00DJFIMW6 1 1392249600 29 I never use it and will remove it from my device.  It may be fun to play but it takes so long to load that we don't use it.
A1181NRB5DRTZF B008BJQCCM 5 1366243200 33 I got this as the free app of the day, but would have gladly paid for it. I couldn't stop playing until I was done. Very fun and addictive game. I want more!
A1181NRB5DRTZF B00FAPF5U0 5 1400630400 36 This is hands down the best mobile &quot;spare time&quot; game I have ever played. Got a few minutes to kill? Play Candy Crush! Its a casual intense time killer that I can't stop playing. Love it!
A1181NRB5DRTZF B0064X7B4A 5 1366502400 36 I was skeptical at first, but my girlfriend convinced me to play. Now I love it and can't stop playing. I check a couple times a day to see if it's my turn. I am addicted.
A1185AD3FCA5KF B00B7PKAKC 5 1360195200 33 This is both fun AND original. Noodlecake Studios has brought us a legend for (hopefully) years to come. I loved Flow, Happy Poo Jump, &amp; hopefully more good apps will come from here!!!
A1185AD3FCA5KF B00CTQ6SIG 5 1377475200 27 Very funny. I love the opening in which  it pokes fun at time management games (like Happy Street or Campus Life). Very fun but tutorial takes FOREVER.
A11862BK46JHT6 B004Q3CJQ0 5 1364083200 21 Does everything I need. Id recommend this to anyone that doesnt habe it built in to their interface already. Well done.
A11862BK46JHT6 B00AQF8CJ0 5 1370476800 28 The liddle puddin's remind me of the jelly games as far as the look. Game is great fun especially if you are looking for a good time waster.
A118AEUP1Z3B5D B00BNH1PF8 5 1363046400 22 love how u can refresh screen and it changes the letters.  use process of elimination on the ones u cant figure out
A118AEUP1Z3B5D B00CWY76CC 5 1381968000 24 Really gets your mind thinking.  The game that thinks out of the box.  If you like hidden puzzles you will love this..........with a twist.
A118AEUP1Z3B5D B00BG3ID0Y 4 1363996800 22 very addictive,  cant put it down.  would like to be able to have option of lighting up whena letter is in correct.
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00G5LQ5MU 3 1389484800 24 Not to sure yet But ready to give it a start. I just stated this game don't have much to say at this time.
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00DD1F0VC 4 1373587200 45 I would give it 4 stars because had difficult with touch screen on Kindle fire. Great story , wish didn't have to wait so long for something new. Love big fish games and g5 but the wait is way to long for something  New. So
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00A4KVFLY 3 1389830400 99 Very addicting, love it. But can cost you money in order to play for a little while. Wish they would give you more coins a day, your only given two coins a day and it takes two coins per games which last maybe one minute. So i have put about 5 dollars so far, think I should delete because cost to much to actual play and enjoy. That why I would rate it only a three because it cost slot in the long run. Or you wait two.or three days until you collect enough to play more one game.
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00E8KLWB4 3 1388620800 50 A little confusing, just got the game so still trying to figure it out. It took a long time to down load so a this I think I am going hang in there. So a this time my is maybe a 3' but it might change at a later time.
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00B2TET3C 4 1400630400 27 Just got the game so far so good at this point and time I would rate it about a four at least until I play it more
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00E5GJ7QS 4 1400025600 35 It's a good game kind of slow depending on how many cards you play. I just started yesterday. In time you have to buy items to keep going. But I would give it a four
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00DOUQP9I 2 1376352000 20 Dose not work very good, my granddaughter who is 5 years old hated it maybe if had more to do
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00FAPF5U0 4 1390348800 33 Like the game, if you don't care about waiting for you get more life. Which I don't because it dose not take to long at most i waited was 20 minutes sometimes less
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00DRHY8EW 3 1387584000 29 Not my type of game , this is a puzzle . I would give the game  3 stars because I don't think I would have paid 2,99 for it.
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00CWGWAEE 5 1369872000 23 Good and long game. Love that it has zoom and a walkthroughNot all games come with walkthroughs . Can't wait for part two
A118BMQSYJH3J8 B00BMW6ER8 5 1402358400 41 Like this game, have played almost all them. This is one of.My favourites, it is like speed bingo  beating the clock and getting bingo. You get bingo chips every three hours. If you lime a challenge you will like this one.
A118DKQAKG26Q3 B004EFYZ1C 5 1356652800 26 This is a great app. Very interesting and amazing to look at. I have only had it a few days but am enjoying it so far.
A118DKQAKG26Q3 B004SOR4H6 3 1356652800 24 I am new to Twitter and am having some trouble figuring it now. Will need to get a niece or nephew to assist me.
A118F9CHIYAK7C B00A9JG6RS 4 1357084800 44 It never crashes and the levels get progressively harder . I really like this game ,you can play it offline or on line . Only problem I have with it is it is misconfigured for Facebook so I can't play with my friends .
A118F9CHIYAK7C B009ZZDNT6 3 1356220800 24 Great look and alarm sounds. Sounds really really loud on my kindle and hasn't crashed yet . I think it might wake us up
A118HRSV9MQYHH B0080SZ0V8 4 1345507200 38 The game is challenging  and it forces you to think but at the same time it does not get so hard that the player lose interest either which is a smart move from the developers of the game.
A118HRSV9MQYHH B00ATDOVNK 5 1358640000 77 I should have waited until I played the game first before buying the collectors but  this game designer is pretty  good. One critique that i I have about the alternate game to the HOG is that not everyone knows how to play dominoes. Bad choice. I don't know how nor have any intentions to learn but overall that doesn't impede on the fun aspect it just makes one try to find the objects a little bit harder.
A118HRSV9MQYHH B00AIQP9DE 4 1357603200 28 I like playing of mystery and excitement so if you're like me, this ones for you too! I wonder just what the sequel will be ... if any?
A118HRSV9MQYHH B006JNH7YY 4 1343606400 25 Nice story line and it is fun to play. Not all G5 games are interesting, some are too premature to play, but not this one.
A118HRSV9MQYHH B007ZD17XO 5 1347753600 56 This game is very fin and mesmerizing at the same time. I am new to this game bit I still want to learn how to master the game  I just hope this rating on this game isn't too premature at this time because alawar games sometimes get hung  up and kicks you out of game play.
A118K1KQE1935K B00HX49SM2 5 1393545600 22 I love playing this game.  It is lots of fun and keeps me entertained.  In fact, I like all of Emily's games.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0067Q4RCI 5 1327708800 43 There are a lot of things to find, places to go and things to do. I tried the free game first and enjoyed it, so I knew what I was buying. I liked that. The price drop made me get the full game.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B007V5CF5K 5 1335571200 41 I was looking for a game for myself. The kids have enough space on my fire. I enjoyed this game! Lot's of things to do hints if you just don't know what to do next. Lot's of game fun, great price!
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0080JD59G 5 1345939200 42 I truly enjoyed playing this game. It was fun, thoughtful, and long playing. Well worth the money. I'm hoping to find another game as enjoyable as this game, it's going to be hard. I'd put this game in my top five list.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0085CEBGY 4 1338076800 24 Alawar Entertainment just keeps on putting out hit after hit. Good, fun, worth the money, never sorry you bought it entertainment. Keep them coming!
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0073LWEXK 5 1328400000 57 I'm enjoying this game very much. Not for 5 year olds, but not needing a degree in gaming to play it. Just right for the most of us who want some entertainment, but do not have unlimited to play. I paid full price and at $1.99 I feel like I got great game at a great price.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0097GVJWQ 5 1349568000 43 I loved this game!  My new best ever game. l had no problems loading or playing this game on my Fire.  The game was a nice length, and not to easy. Help hints when you need them. Not disappointment, you'll enjoy this game.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B006ZE9Q5A 5 1327449600 48 I enjoyed playing Pirate Mysteries. The length of the game is surprising long, and the puzzles are fun too. Nothing is to hard or easy. Well worth $.99. Plays well on the Fire. Use zoom in, and out to find all the objects, even those on the edges.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B00769HSSK 5 1354406400 45 Our family loves this game!  3 generations play and enjoy it. It loaded and played from 2 accounts on 3 Fires with no problems. Download and picture saving issues must have been worked out. We've played for months with no problems. Well worth the money!
A118S7PRIQKI6J B008Y212PI 5 1381190400 23 This is my new go to pass time.  I enjoy this game very much.  I can not wait for free time to play.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B004FOA84A 5 1303344000 31 fun app worked great on my Droid. Not to hard or easy. Just a fun way to pass some time on my Droid! Can we have more games like these please?
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0085P2Z6E 4 1342656000 30 I enjoyed playing this game very much. A fun hidden object game with a few fun puzzles thrown in. Fun theme also. I would like more games like this games.
A118S7PRIQKI6J B0060I3IJG 4 1324425600 23 love stumbling the web with Su it takes me places I would have found on my own.  Beautiful photos, great blogs, fun spots.
A118TPXMX2MAHG B00CMMR9SU 5 1368489600 34 I have not been able to stay away from this game.  It is so fun. Stratagizing to hit the bubbles is challenging.  I will start all over when I get through all the levels.
A118TPXMX2MAHG B00AEJM6H2 5 1359849600 29 Play several times a day. Very challenging. I got many friends hooked. I hope there are more worlds after three.  If not I would redo the whole series again.
A118TPXMX2MAHG B0064X7B4A 5 1341446400 23 Fun game and a great way to stay connected with family and friends. Can help you learn new words and improve your spelling.
A118U5FPZIGGVO B00FAPF5U0 4 1389312000 38 Not enough time and to few lives.  Not enough of the right combinations in the areas that need cleared.  Not buying any coins or lives....so just set it aside and wait for the lives to fill back up.
A118U5FPZIGGVO B0058EBNAO 5 1359936000 25 Love this weather app.  Gives you up to date information and weather alerts for your area.  More info than you need really, but mores better.
A118U5FPZIGGVO B0063IH60K 5 1359936000 20 Love this version of solitaire.  Easy to play.  Love that they auto complete when you have won the game.  :)
A118WSI7TQJIA4 B00ABGEFWC 4 1357689600 32 If you like animal games then you will like Lee this on one. It has fun cute animals and you can play it almost continued n poo husky until you get bored.
A118WSI7TQJIA4 B00A6GNC1M 5 1358208000 24 i play this all the time on facebook. i love this game becasue it gives you powerups to help you win more bingo games
A118WSI7TQJIA4 B00BM7HD4Q 4 1363737600 22 It's fun and helps n pass the time. Easy game once you get the hang of the cards. Plus its free lol
A118WSI7TQJIA4 B00A8ECU24 5 1358208000 25 this game is fun but takes a really long time to accrue money to complete the challenges and goals. but i would still play it
A118WSI7TQJIA4 B008N8IV2U 5 1358208000 50 This game is really fun and i can only imagine how much fun the creators had making each level to confound. BUT they need to hace a clue for the next step because some of these levels make me go insane since i have no idea how to complete them.
A118X7N0EXSBKC B007TXUZ1U 3 1338854400 25 not my favorite but I don't have to check it 24/7.its not addicting so that's good. Its still fun. Taking care if a baby :)
A118X7N0EXSBKC B008Y2FRFO 5 1348272000 24 I love this game but then again I don't like how long it takes to get the coins. Still love the game though :)
A118X7N0EXSBKC B00AA87JGU 5 1373414400 38 Hell ya I like it!!! It's hard to find a game that has so many levels of greatness!!! Especially for FREE!!! Fun and free??? Hell ya I'm down! I haven't had any problems with it! I love it!!!
A118X7N0EXSBKC B00846GKTW 5 1338076800 25 Fun. Time consuming but its a lot of fun. I have always wanted to style someone without messing up. Here I have a choice :)
A118X7N0EXSBKC B006QC53WG 4 1358294400 45 I did love it until I realized that I can not unlock new levels without purchasing the gems. I got stuck where I am and can not move on without paying. It was fun while it lasted. Wish I could earn the little gem things.
A118X7N0EXSBKC B00D0VZLVE 4 1373241600 27 really fun to play, has challenging pictures but fun to figure out.  I am enjoying this game but it would be nice if there were better hints.
A118X7N0EXSBKC B006OBWGHO 5 1329696000 26 it is fun but I suggest the full version because you get more level packs and the rest they did not make you get for free
A118X7N0EXSBKC B008Y7SMQU 3 1348185600 21 its fun but its difficult trying to remember all the logos. then again it makes me pay attention to things hahaha
A118X7N0EXSBKC B00881VLCE 4 1340668800 30 I love putting puzzles together and this game is great for putting the puzzles together while waiting in car or waiting room etc... only bad thing is not enough puzzles.
A118ZQMQRL30J4 B008WXNBWG 3 1380412800 51 Stopped using this app because as I added more notes to the page (landscape view) the keyboard coveredthe lower notes.  Of course the keyboard didn't cover up as many notes in portrait view but it was a hassle to have to move a note up on the page to edit it.
A11921BDN5IIGK B00H2TEG7U 5 1396569600 43 Solitaire is fun and a very relaxing game to play. I give it a 5 star rating because I have had no problems with the game locking up and if you enjoy solitaire it's a free download and a good game to play.
A11921BDN5IIGK B00D6SBOWG 5 1396483200 38 This game is totally addictive! Once you start it is SO hard to put it down. This game is free and so different than most of the solitaire games. Give it a try...I think you will enjoy it.
A11921BDN5IIGK B00B2TET3C 1 1364601600 37 Going to delete this one. It was enjoyable to a point, but don't appreciate all the Casino e-mails we started getting 3 to 5 times a day ever since we had this game added to the Kindle.
A11921BDN5IIGK B00C5J4MO4 5 1395878400 43 Another one my grandson really enjoys playing...and for an 8 year old, he beats me in this game hands down. It is fun and quite a challenge on some of the courses. For free, it's worth the time to download and try it.
A11921BDN5IIGK B00INJ2P0S 4 1394064000 28 It's okay, but not as enjoyable as many of the other hidden objects games I have played. May think differently after I play it a little more often.
A11921BDN5IIGK B00ICS67BS 4 1400544000 27 What is not to like about hidden objects games...if you like that kind of game. I do and find the biggest share much fun, including this one.
A11921BDN5IIGK B006HXXJH0 5 1362182400 29 This game is so much fun...for ANY age!! The animal sounds make this game even more enjoyable to play. NO negatives here, it gets played alot on the Kindle.
A1192ASAGTZEWB B00FAPF5U0 5 1382227200 21 I AM SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME! I LOVE IT AND AT THE SAME TIME IT  AGGRAVATES ME!! GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!  :)
A1192ASAGTZEWB B00B51MR4U 4 1363305600 22 This game is great when u need to kill some time!!!!!!! I really like this game. Good graphics and easy to play!
A1192ASAGTZEWB B00GXH3TGG 5 1395878400 22 I love this game!!!!! It is very addictive and the payouts aren't bad either. I guarantee you will LOVE this slots game!
A1193APURCP49W B004K56MNU 2 1391472000 23 It never would do anything for me. Would not let anything work for me. I have no idea why? Thus, it is deleted.
A1193APURCP49W B004VS0JPI 3 1396051200 34 I haven't used it much but it works as far as I can tell. I just don't know anyone who would teach me Spanish and the tapes just have not gotten me very far.
A1193APURCP49W B0084HDG8Y 5 1391472000 78 Works pretty good. Sound is fantastic on Kindle Fire HD. I am tilting a lot. Like any game it takes adjusting to it. Learning curve or however you wish to put it. This is a great toy of sorts at least for short times of amusement here and there. All of this being new I don't know whats good versus whats great yet. Having so much fun that it all is pretty cool to me right now still.
A1193APURCP49W B0061S0A64 5 1391472000 56 This is a real time killer. I was exploring this app and got lost for some time. The music or rhythmic beat stuff is extremely comfortable. Somewhat hypnotic. Feel asleep with it. today just now figured out you can change the tones, rhythm and such. This is a keeper for my entertainment and fun time waste.
A1193APURCP49W B004GYY714 2 1390262400 28 Shows to be playing but has no sound at all. It doesn't work. Not sure why?  I will delete and try to find another way to play music.
A1193APURCP49W B007URBVA4 5 1401667200 44 This is a fun diversion once in a while. The sound effects are fantastic as well as the game. Very enjoyable and a great way to get someone to shut up when you don't want to listen to them jabber. This is perfect stuff.
A1193APURCP49W B007U8JRWW 3 1391472000 47 This had some slow and static cameras from places across the pond somewhere. I did not try it very long and removed it. I just don't have much patience. I did not see much of anything interesting,  but street, snow & water landscapes. I just deleted it.
A1193APURCP49W B00GRVV29E 5 1392076800 39 This is just plain fun to fiddle with. It is a great time killer as well as entertaining and good music. Eye and noise candy that is hard to beat for me. Very nice toy for this old man.
A1193APURCP49W B008RMEGXA 1 1395014400 87 This is not free. It is a portal to try and get you to buy the magazine for more than it usually cost. If you already have a print subscription it might be a different story and they might play friendly. I  could not even create an account on this app to subscribe or do anything with it.  I have always loved their website and grew up with their magazine for years. This app has nothing to see or read. Go another route until they fix this.
A1193APURCP49W B00BGDEK9C 5 1391472000 48 This is cool if only for the sound effects. It works well  and you can adjust ball movement some and I have always liked the power of the pins crashing. The cheering and the cries of amazement at my skill is also greatly appreciated. Another fun time killer.
A1193APURCP49W B008XAKC98 5 1398556800 40 Quite a lot of content at this site. I think this one might be a keeper. I hope it works well and doesn't crash a bunch like most video and tv view sites. Not sure what causes this. Great site!
A1193APURCP49W B0093QQAEM 5 1390262400 30 its a little hard for a newbie to get through the hullabaloo and get it loaded and going but finally it is working great. Fun to watch on this device!
A1193APURCP49W B00BMR5HOO 5 1397260800 46 I just love having the weather and forecast at my fingertips. I can plan my activities much more productively as I like to work outside as much as possible. I can plan for inside when the weather is terrible. Simple and perfect. Updates it's forecast frequently.
A1193APURCP49W B00E1JZIGW 2 1395014400 97 This seems to work at first but always shuts down my Kindle Fire HD every time I have attempted to watch an episode. I never once got to finish a full episode without it shutting me down. I did get to see a bunch of Red Bull commercials every couple of minutes. Hope they get paid well for that and can possibly hire a developer to fix/upgrade whatever is wrong with it. Some of the shows would be nice to watch. Guess I can't cut the cable yet. At least now I know the Red Bull song.
A1193APURCP49W B009LQ8X58 5 1391731200 31 It has worked well so far and had no issues. It does the job quickly also. Makes me feel a bit more secure and that is worth a lot to me.
A1193APURCP49W B004LOMB2Q 2 1397260800 25 Never worked for me. Would not let me sign in or do anything. not sure what it is for or supposed to be used for.
A1193APURCP49W B00AESN8XY 5 1395014400 76 Great game and works fine. i destroyed the Earth in 802 days. I am not much of a game player but wanted to see what it was like. I don't have much time for this stuff but if this is your thing this is probably a good one. I just don't have time but liked it and even bought more stuff to mess with it. It is made really well. Great time waster! Cheap and fun.
A1193APURCP49W B00B4LFMGG 5 1390262400 64 Great reader so far. Easy to Navigate and read. Will probably add another news reader to balance out differing viewpoints of people in this country and in other civilized countries as I can find them. Says it has a text to speech feature that I have not found yet. That might be fun. It has good rating from the Kindle Fire books and guides.
A1193APURCP49W B008655OVQ 2 1391472000 34 It would not work at all for me. It had some sort of glitch that I could not figure out so I cannot give it any kind of review as it would not work.
A1193APURCP49W B007GE0X3M 4 1390780800 34 This is more like what I have been looking for. It is the easiest to navigate through that I have found from the few I have tried. Even has an alarm set-up with it.
A1193APURCP49W B0057PAY8G 3 1396051200 20 i just don't use it. Not really sure what it is for. cannot help to review whatever it is. Bye.
A1193APURCP49W B0085YOD1A 5 1390262400 27 This is so simple and gives me a reference so I don't have to wonder if I need to recharge. Very useful for me peace of mind.
A1193APURCP49W B00DREKMPO 5 1391472000 78 It seems to work well. It has 3 scan settings and even on the deep scan it is really fast. No threats found so far. That give me some peace of mind whether it works or not. I hope I never ever have to find out. If you mess around with unsecured wi-fi access points in public places I would probably get this and whatever else premium they offer. Certainly don't do your banking at the coffee shop.
A1193APURCP49W B009XAJI8S 5 1390780800 79 Seems to be a bit limited for today's technology but I like it for what it is. Maybe I just need to explore further. Lots of old movies and shows that I haven't seen since a little boy brings back lots of memories. All kinds of shows I had forgotten. Works great! Original B&W Beverly Hillbilly's last night. So glad that Ellie and Granny are still doing fine! No dumb-down reality garbage or stupid commercials is worth a lot.
A1193APURCP49W B007FTZDN8 5 1393718400 112 Always something good to hear and learn about. It is so nice at times to realize that there are others on the planet who are interested in leaving this world a little better instead of just the usual scenario of destruction of our planet. Science, technology, medical, art, injustices getting solved, cures, the list is endless. After the news when you start to wonder if all earthlings have turned to zombies this is very healing. I will keep this app for sure.  So much to learn about. Great site to get on my Kindle Fire HD. This is nice when trapped waiting at appointment or whenever. Great bedtime stories/talks for myself too!
A1193APURCP49W B004R49A4W 5 1390780800 30 Really like this app. It is very handy and fun when girlfriend and I go nature walk. I can pretend I actually know what I saw earlier in the day.
A1193APURCP49W B004EBZX6W 5 1390262400 60 Not sure if it is important or not but it is a cool gadget just to look at. Shows my connection is strong here in front of my PC. When I feel more comfortable using this new Kindle I will have to go to some Starbucks, bookstores, and the libraries and see how strong the Wi-Fi connections are around Tulsa.
A1193APURCP49W B00EKTCQCC 3 1397260800 37 I would love it but did not realize you have to keep buying layers on and on to see more and more. If you got money to burn I imagine it would be fantastic and real educational.
A1193APURCP49W B004DLNC4I 3 1391472000 137 I just wanted to see if it works and it does. I took it off because I don't know if it might be illegal in this state as most everything probably is here. Have no use for it anyway. It works and can be adjusted to many different areas at least where I am located. I didn't know so many people were jabbering on the radio so much. I heard Fire, Police and a lot of unidentifiable jabber talk going on even late in the night. An old Ham or CB operator that knew the lingo would enjoy this thing. A friend of mine works in the Fire Department so I will have to find out if I can have this without cops going goofy on me somehow for some reason. Might be useful in an emergency?
A1193APURCP49W B009C7ZQM4 4 1391472000 48 This is like my crap cleaner on the PC I think. It is just and easy & quick way to delete your junk files and cookies and whatever junk that will pile up from our surfing & shopping and all. It seem to work well & really quick.
A1193APURCP49W B006TH5I28 5 1391472000 82 This thing has so many features that  may never figure what they are for. It has time, temperature, voltage average usage times, Last usage time, Screen %, WiFi %, Awake %, App usage %, battery life hour & min, Screen on Hr. & min., has a list of things and %'s that each app is using, it just really goes over the top. Incredibly geeky stuffs. Its great! Next time the kids come over they will think I've entered this century, finally.
A1193APURCP49W B008B80ZGW 5 1394928000 45 This is a simple but nice application. Very fun to use hidden and mess with the grandkids. A few are very relaxing and the birds singing interest the birds some in my backyard. Another nice toy for my Kindle Fire HD. Works flawlessly so far.
A1193APURCP49W B006PJ3UKC 5 1401667200 23 Good newspaper. Easy way to keep up with world news. No reason to pulverize trees anymore with hard-copy newspapers. Will keep this one.
A1193APURCP49W B007VUA7VO 5 1398556800 42 This is my second battery app I have played with. It even has more technical features than the other one and is just cool to fiddle with. Another toy in my toolbox with alarms and all kinds of settings to mess with.
A1193APURCP49W B00701L6TQ 5 1397260800 48 This is fun and I am not a gamer. I am just now getting the hang of it but was surprised at how i kept playing it over and over. I don't ever have time for these things but I guess giving up sleep won't be so bad.
A1193APURCP49W B00F54F1G4 4 1390780800 41 It works well. A sword fighting game. I am just not that interested in these things but I have a grandson that is 7 & 2 grand daughters that are 8 and they are good. All of them would like it!
A1193APURCP49W B008KYOCA2 3 1397260800 30 I just didn't use it. i can barely keep up with the day to day. It is probably a good calendar as any. I can't even keep up with paper.
A1193APURCP49W B005V1N71W 5 1390780800 39 I don't think I will have to look any further for some music. I have been using this for years on the PC and it is working great on this Kindle Fire HD. Very cool. Groovy. Far Out Man!
A119583C0HM2Y3 B00823EFEY 1 1342310400 25 waste of time. the app does most of the creating. you just sit and watch. children under 8 may be amused for a short time.
A119583C0HM2Y3 B005J80RTW 4 1328918400 27 Fast paced, challenging game. I wish there was more time between rounds, I'm out of breath after each game. The instant world wide ranking is the best.
A119583C0HM2Y3 B00CTQ6SIG 3 1377043200 77 I like this app because I like the Simpsons. Otherwise I wouldn't bother. It starts with a lot of activity but quickly slows down to a dull routine as resources become more expensive in either time or money. You can't really make a cool Springfield without spending a lot of money. And there's always a chance that you can lose everything if an update or log-in goes wrong. Entertaining but starting to wear thin at level 22.
A11974D3CVTFXJ B00AA87JGU 5 1374278400 21 Good puzzle game but not too frustrating.  I have only done the first &quot;chapter&quot; but I am really enjoying the challenge.
A11974D3CVTFXJ B00AIQP9DE 5 1378771200 29 Great game with lots of twists and turns.  Variations of puzzles and the storyline is unique.  Would recommend to anyone into these type of puzzle/story/games.  One of the best!
A11974D3CVTFXJ B008LXN9II 3 1377907200 20 not as challenging as some of the other games. but a good boredoom buster!  Pluses the whole family can play.
A11974D3CVTFXJ B0097EWK3A 4 1379462400 28 I am truly enjoying Enigmatis.  The graphics and story line are superb.  I expect that the story will become more intense as the story unfolds.  Would definetly recommend.
A119D5ZWTNOVNJ B006ON41FC 1 1360454400 23 This game is really fun but it always glitches and asks you to rate it. So here you go. A one star review.
A119D5ZWTNOVNJ B00A8ECU24 5 1370476800 53 This game is really fun! There is so many things to buy and you make money so fast! The selection of ponies you can get is huge and awesome! The only thing I didn't like was that you have to be connected to a social network to add friends just  to get Zecora!
A119D5ZWTNOVNJ B00BLS2U6M 5 1388016000 26 This app is really fun. I like how you get to customize your own celebrity and buy cool stuff throughout the game. You should buy it!
A119D5ZWTNOVNJ B009WO7NQO 5 1360627200 30 This so an amazing app for Star Wars fans! I love the Chewbacca bird and the &quot;pigtroopers.&quot; This is definitely worth 99 cents! I hope you approve of my review!
A119D5ZWTNOVNJ B00IM3ANCM 4 1403827200 59 This is a great app and I think it is A LOT better and more entertaining than Flappy Bird. The only reason I gave it a four is because the ads are annoying, and if you fall in the water, it takes a little while for you to get back to the beginning. But otherwise, this game is great!
A119I5L6ELBJ84 B00FXKHEK6 5 1385683200 20 my kids like it brings back some memories...lol my kids are amazed that I know who some of them are.
A119I5L6ELBJ84 B0073LHCCS 4 1352851200 30 this game is okay haven't really played it much to know exactly how much I enjoy it will leave a mores detailed review when I get to know it better
A119IEF337BCRS B005023UTG 5 1319932800 38 This is basically Missile Command, but with updated graphics.  Great graphics, great pace, great sound effects.  This is one of the few old school games that manages to keep its appeal even in such a faithful recreation.  Awesome.
A119IEF337BCRS B004DPC5Y2 5 1320624000 33 one of the most annoying ways yup can entertain your kids.  the thing is that game keeps them interested for a long time, and it might even teach them something in the process.
A119IEF337BCRS B006ON41FC 5 1333238400 33 Nicely addictive game.  The objectives keep you interested even though you keep flying through the same terrain.  It would be nice to add different courses to unlock, but it's worth the 99 cents.
A119NIBOR9KD0B B00CB4ET0K 5 1388361600 23 Game is highly addictive and graphics are great. What I like the most are the different guns available that are also historically accurate.
A119NIBOR9KD0B B009HKL4B8 1 1388793600 39 Why do all the hybrid options result in the monster you have to negotiate?  It should be 1/5 times results in the monster, but I get 100% monster result which is REALLY irritating. It's a waste of my Simoleons!
A119RA7LF54RIT B00910Y1OQ 5 1353715200 37 I actually played this on my computer first, and so enjoyed, it I got the app for my phone.  It is really fun and I would recommend it to anyone who likes 3 in a row games.
A119RA7LF54RIT B00823EFEY 4 1353715200 29 I got this app for my grandsons and they think it is pretty neat.  Even my teenager thinks it is cool.  The things you can make are pretty good.
A119RA7LF54RIT B008BM3TKM 3 1355356800 44 I am a big fan of Big Fish games,but i was not impressed with this game.  There was too much running around and not enough seek and find or any games for that matter.  Would not recommend buying, look for another Big Fish game.
A119RA7LF54RIT B00FAPF5U0 4 1386892800 97 This game is VERY addictive! I enjoy playing it but have come to realize it is really just a money making scheme...but what good thing out there isn't.  I do feel there should be a way to earn more lives and maybe there is and I just haven't got that deep into the game.  I would cautiously recommend it to others with the knowledge it may cost you and if you are not a very strong willed person and you do not have the money to spare then maybe you should avoid becoming en snarled in it.
A119RA7LF54RIT B006BDHAX0 5 1353715200 38 This app is the traditional Mahjong card app.  When I have time to spare, I play this app for a few minutes or one game or so.  I would recommend having it on your kindle to pass time.
A119RA7LF54RIT B0097GVJWQ 4 1353024000 20 This was a very enjoyable game, graphics are great...I would play the next one.  I  just love Big Fish games!
A119RA7LF54RIT B00BJ9VBLI 4 1375574400 23 Fun game great graphics. I will buy the next one. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes matching games. Totally addictive
A119RA7LF54RIT B00AEL7M7E 5 1359072000 49 I love this game!  I had purchased it a few years ago for the computer and was excited to see it for Kindle Fire.  If you want to see if you would like to purchase the full one, this is an excellent opportunity to give this game a try.
A119RM59VPDONS B005HSL626 5 1366502400 67 I love this game! It is one of the one great free games on the app store that doesn't ask you to do stuff you don't want to do. The one problem I have is that the piano blade is annoying because it makes just random notes whenever you slice a fruit and I just wish that the piano blade would play a song when it slices.
A119RM59VPDONS B00E7VV2RS 5 1383696000 51 This game is really good. For the people who just want clash of clans on their kindle, this is really close to it. The only problems I have with it is that the game froze once or twice in the beginning. But other than that it is a really good game.
A119RM59VPDONS B00EQ0CKRQ 2 1377388800 72 The screen shots and description are totally misleading. The graphics are not as good as asphalt 6, the crashes are totally lame because your car doesn't fall apart at all, if you just tap a wall you crash, the controls are hard, and the jumps are also pretty lame. Gameloft, if you make another lame game that you say is really fun, you will lose this customer and probably other customers too.
A119RM59VPDONS B009WYCDZU 4 1358812800 115 OK some people are making reviews on this game about an ad for it that is supposedly stopping them from playing &quot;the sims free play.&quot; (And they make reviews on the game even before they buy it which is weird because amazon does not let you make a review on a game before you buy it, please don't do that, it is just annoying to do that, and if you do, well, you're the new annoying ad.) Don't just ignore this game just because of an ad for it, try out the game and if you are at least sort of into racing games you will like it guaranteed. Please take this review into account.
A119RM59VPDONS B00CKW6FVE 4 1371340800 90 Now I am not a tetris fan, but I don't hate it I just am not a tetris fan. This game even though I am not a tetris fan is still the best tetris game I have ever played!Now just to not get confused about the game, this tetris is still tetrisbut with a little spin on it, it shows you all the possible places you can put the piece that's falling, and there's other little spins on the game too, but just don't forget that this is still tetris.
A119RMVOBG7Q1R B0089BPEZS 5 1388966400 35 Works great for me, easy to find the shows I want to watch, browse others, and play them. Easy app that works like its supposed to. As long as you DO in fact have HBO.
A119RMVOBG7Q1R B0066TUXU6 4 1362009600 26 Does what it's supposed to and so far has done it without any problems. Very standard app like you would find on your other mobile devices.
A119RMVOBG7Q1R B007VUA7VO 5 1374105600 38 Its really tough to tell when your battery is actually charging on your Kindle Fire....this helps alleviate some of that by showing you that its charging with a lightning bolt on the battery symbol, and a battery %.
A119SU7M5GUP58 B005ZXWMUS 5 1367712000 105 This app taught me a great lesson about tablets. I have a discontinued pandigital tablet. I was having lots of trouble getting anything to run on it. I could go to Netflix on the web but I couldn't pick a program and get it to run. My sister (who also has that type tablet) and I worked together until we were finally able to download and install the Netflix app so I can watch Netflix on this tablet. So sometimes if it doesn't work like you think it should just keep at it. Watching Netflix on the tablet is way cool and worth the trouble.
A119SU7M5GUP58 B0064X7FVE 5 1367712000 70 I liked the fact that the weather channel app works at all. I have one of those Pandigital tablets and most of the apps don't seem to work on it very well if you can even get them to download. I didn't realize until after I bought it that it is a discontinued model so you can't even go to their site for help. Weather Channel works great though. Yay!!!
A119VFPHRP11MY B004V4S4MW 5 1313884800 25 If you are like me, and find it hard to remember dates like birthdays anniversaries etc, then this is for you. Perfect for us men
A119VFPHRP11MY B004L5WS2S 5 1313884800 23 I beat the game. So I bought the second one! Really well made and simple unless you want to be perfect at it.
A119VFPHRP11MY B005FNNIAG 5 1315440000 33 Well it's a good game. Just annoyed that it is free after I spent money on it... The game does glitch after finishing a stage and the app crashes on the world map.
A119VFPHRP11MY B004V6K38I 1 1314921600 27 Force closing on my Evo 3D with ICS. Needs another update, fix immediately. I doubt that the app will work for anyone that updates it them self.
A119VFPHRP11MY B005ZXWMUS 5 1325289600 30 The UI is much better. As for the video/audio lag it generally sorts itself out quickly. The only improvement could be that the search feature was a bit more intuitive
A119VFPHRP11MY B007N5YIUS 5 1332547200 50 First let me say that if you have a kindle fire then you should consider yourselves lucky since you can have the he version at least. Now the game it self is incredible! Really enjoyable too since you have some interesting physics to work with. Looking forward to more levels!
A119VFPHRP11MY B005023UTG 2 1316476800 52 This game sucks big time. I did no better when I tried versus randomly tapping the screen. Also  to the dev, why are the missiles only like 5 pixels? Puny targets even for a big screen. Only reason it gets 2 stars is that I do like the camera movement with explosions.
A119VFPHRP11MY B005D9MUWY 3 1313884800 21 After using swype for less than 2 months, it will be near impossible to switch, making all other key boards inferior.
A119VFPHRP11MY B005QT60PO 4 1321142400 89 I am pretty impressed by the sound and graphics. However there are a few issues that should be addressed to make this perfect. Firstly I wish that the throttle response was a bit more err, responsive? The engine start up is pretty accurate but otherwise it seems a bit slow to respond. Lastly I wish that instead of having to hold our device flat, we could hold it vertical and still use the tilt functions. Also this looks great on tablets. once those improvements are made I will purchase.
A119VFPHRP11MY B004T3K50E 1 1319414400 75 Glad that I never paid for this because it would've been a waste of money. There was a lot of potential in this game but it was all thrown aside by a shoddy amateur dev. Game interaction is nearly impossible and there is nothing intuitive here. In other words, when I tap on something, I fully expect something to happen. Goes to show that some things are better in concept, than in the harsh reality.
A119VFPHRP11MY B004R1LNGS 4 1315094400 36 I love the app still but it really needs the option to reset the password. Also if we had an option to format everything and have it repeat the formatting process several times for security reasons.
A119VFPHRP11MY B004YWUV40 2 1320883200 39 I don't understand why all the high praise for this relatively dull app. First off, it's a huge memory hog. 17mb! Can't even move to sd! And also I just find it to be genuinely bland. Just my &cent;2
A119VFPHRP11MY B0055SWM08 2 1334016000 50 I was playing this game for about 20 minutes when I got bored with it. The problem is that this is really a game of snake with obstactles in the way. Nothing special about it unlike angry birds space. Needless to say I uninstalled Quell within less than an hour.
A119VFPHRP11MY B0057IQ0C2 5 1321747200 89 I am an Optimus owner so I was disappointed when it wouldn't be compatible. Luckily now I own a tablet and I really love the game. The graphics are simply beautiful and they render naturally. Also I really like the music as it definitely keeps you calm even in the most difficult of levels. My only complaint would be that the crate acts more like bubble gum than a heavy wooden box. I mean that by how the crate sticks onto things pretty well. Otherwise I am really satisfied.
A119VFPHRP11MY B0052UZIFA 4 1320969600 35 Works on HTC flyer, but the graphics are horrendous. I wish that popcap would resolve the issue. Resolution is bad even on my optimus v, which is sad because it has such a small screen.
A119VWF4LZNJC B009AY04A8 5 1377820800 37 Interesting game. It keeps your attention. I did find it a little wordy in the conversation though. The puzzles aren't too difficult and the hidden object portions can be frustrating. I'm looking forward to the second part!!
A119VWF4LZNJC B007P6T52G 5 1340841600 23 you are offering unlimited play for 3 days for $1.99. It won't let me buy it...why??????? other then this I like the game
A119VWF4LZNJC B0085N9I84 5 1343347200 22 Very simple and fun game. Anyone can play it. Great way to pass time when you're bored or waiting in line... lol
A119VWF4LZNJC B00CRLSN4U 3 1375142400 35 This is fun but can be frustrating..lol. It would be nice if you could earn more coins per correct guess. Once you get stuck on one you're done playing unless you purchase more. NOT NICE!!!
A119VWF4LZNJC B00E5GJ7QS 5 1398297600 28 This is  the best bingo game I've played so far. I've tried many. It's much easier to regain necessaryItems to continue playing the game. Try it...you'll like it!
A119VWF4LZNJC B00ANHJ8K8 5 1366329600 20 fun game and many things to do and to achieve.  It keeps you busy and is entertaining. Great for kids.
A119XTUX7ST5GY B0064XT03U 5 1327017600 47 I was skeptical that a game like this would be any good or any fun, but I was wrong. This game is really well done and runs great on the Kindle Fire. It defaults to tilt controls, but I would highly recommend using the touch controls instead.
A119Y4OFEKTT8D B00689PMD2 1 1332806400 46 Do not ever I mean ever get this app it will shut down your kindle do many times and then your kindle wont turn on until the next day. This app has cussed me so may problems! I hate it, I hate it, I HATE IT!!!!!!!!
A119Y4OFEKTT8D B0078EHIKG 1 1332806400 43 this game is the worst I mean worst app ever I just got it and all I did wad pour wait flip wait then drag and I was just stupid. don't get it, it is horrible and it is a waist of space.
A11A2KNA3ZDCJI B00DWZ3S90 2 1396656000 24 Very slow and clumsy.  I deleted almost as soon as I installed it.  I only went through a couple levels before I got bored.
A11A2KNA3ZDCJI B00B03IY90 2 1375747200 86 First, I really wish the price for the full version would be listed somewhere before I go through the hassle of downloading something that I won't purchase the full version of later because it's too expensive.  Second, the game itself is OK.  It's got some good graphics and such, but it's really annoying how, in order to choose an item to complete one list, another list from that item pops up.  Pretty soon, everything seems all jumbled up and I didn't like that kind of play.
A11A2KNA3ZDCJI B004SUWR2C 1 1388793600 56 I have no idea why, but this game requires a lot of memory.  After I installed the game, another screen pops up and says it needs an additional 98 mb of memory, do I want to proceed with download.  Well, I didn't and just ended up deleting this.  Anyone know why it needs so much memory?
A11A2Z7KLZQMA1 B005ZXWMUS 4 1325894400 37 audio synchronous problems have been fixed with this latest update but now the video keeps pausing and then it kind of goes into fast forward to catch up. Hopefully in the next update this will be addressed.
A11A2Z7KLZQMA1 B004ECDNJU 2 1325376000 24 game gets depressingly boring after a few levels same thing over and over .  if its free go for it if not forget it
A11A2ZK0UZ9YGQ B006FKPVHQ 4 1379635200 29 I was looking for a very simple to operate calculator and this is it.  The numbers are nice and large and east to read and always at my fingertips.
A11A2ZK0UZ9YGQ B00BF9TU1A 3 1379635200 30 The graphics are very nice and the music in the background is pleasant.  It's pretty repetitive once you have down the first couple of levels, not hard to figure out.
A11A2ZK0UZ9YGQ B0064X7B4A 4 1379635200 45 I LOVE Words With Friends and I wanted to be able to play it almost anywhere - this satisfies that want.  The only thing I don't like about this version is you cannot check to see if it is an acceptable word without submitting it.
A11A508RD7JAXQ B00CWG9EUM 5 1386374400 29 I really like these Big Fish games. Every one takes me a while to finish, but I never get stuck. Really good storyline and I didn't find any glitches.
A11A508RD7JAXQ B0097GVJWQ 5 1368921600 24 This was a lot longer than I expected it to be. Like the Nancy Drew games I used to play on the computer. Fun:)
A11A508RD7JAXQ B007XMV9XK 2 1386374400 27 I got really bored after a little bit. Not as fun as I was expecting it to be. Playing this game is as fun as doing homework.
A11A5SJ9AOKQQ9 B00992CF6W 5 1390867200 66 My opinion of this game is that I believe it is pretty awesome, better than the demo version. It has everything too: I even think I have herobrine!! (I found a random picture I didn't recall taking of herobrine. Talk about the stalker life!) So I think anyone should definitely get this game, trust me, once you start playing, you will refuse to leave your kindle!
A11A5SJ9AOKQQ9 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393718400 32 This game is so fun and addicting! In my opinion, it's better than Flappy Bird because it's easier. If you like Flappy Bird, get this app now! You won't regret it! :)
A11A5T5CQLY5PV B004Z2VHAQ 1 1307145600 19 it sucks and i uninstalled after trying all the diffrent screens, in other word three seconds latertwo thumbs down
A11A5T5CQLY5PV B00EDEMLTW 5 1377129600 23 This app is easy to learn and fun to play. It has many levels. None too challenging but not so easy its boring.
A11A5T5CQLY5PV B006D1ONE4 5 1359936000 31 It might be marketed as a kids game, and for sure its kid themed. But the levels are challenging enough to keep adults interested too. I would buy this game again.
A11A5T5CQLY5PV B00COVCV50 5 1373155200 29 I found the words easy, but it is a fun time killer.  I wish there was more levels.  There is only 20 so far, but they promised to update
A11A5T5CQLY5PV B00AEJM6H2 5 1364688000 23 Easy enough to be fun, challenging enough to keep your interest.  I would recommend this game for most ages.  Children and adults alike
A11A6GHL8SD1ZL B007HGMVIE 5 1333756800 26 those people who hate it some people are right just use the credits you earn. but for me I absoulutley love this game great time waster.
A11A6GHL8SD1ZL B00CV5N5I6 5 1370649600 57 I love this  game because its fun to create different looks all the time and me and my friends always have competitions where yu have to make the ugliest girl or the prettiest girl and it is just super fun (I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO BOYS) i would recommend this game to 3-12 year old girls!!
A11A6GHL8SD1ZL B006PH7WBM 5 1372896000 21 I am 12 and when i got this I thought it would be a snoozer game but i really love it
A11A6GHL8SD1ZL B0066HA1A0 5 1332028800 32 this is awesome i love everything its kind of like the real Sims game . but i kind of wish that thy would of actually had the real Sims games on here
A11A93OQEW456H B004S8L4MI 5 1331337600 34 Pool Break Lite is a very addicting game but it is worth it.It is tottaly fun. The graphics are awesome too.It also helps that it tells u where the balls are going.Tottaly great game
A11A93OQEW456H B0065AFQSU 5 1332028800 24 I use this app every day.whether it's nhl mlb nfl or checking the ncaab tourney scores.best app minus the angry birds I have used
A11A93OQEW456H B006D1ONE4 5 1344729600 34 I have a kindle fire with a lot of apps.this one is by far the best.Disney keeps adding new levels which makes u want to keep playing it.after the update it gets even better
A11A9M2429MQ5E B00FAPF5U0 5 1382400000 40 I am so glad to see candy crush saga on the kindle fire now!  I was disappointed when it wasn't available.  Now it is!  I love this game!  Thanks king.com for finally bringing candy crush saga to the kindle fire!
A11A9M2429MQ5E B00EQ2GBFG 2 1377820800 64 This game wasn't what I thought it would be.  It was suppose to be a free game, but after one level you have to pay to unlock the rest.  My grandchild only got to play the first level. If is suppose to be free why do you lock the rest of the levels?  It should be free for the kids. Not what I expected.
A11A9M2429MQ5E B00AEL7M7E 5 1376438400 22 Great game!!!  Love the challenge, keeps me entertained for hours.  I would recommend this game to everyone that loves match 3 games.
A11A9M2429MQ5E B0063M22QO 5 1376438400 27 I think majong is a very challenging game and I just love to play it.  Hours of fun.  I would recommend to all my friends and family
A11A9M2429MQ5E B00CLVQ8GG 4 1376438400 21 Very good game.  Great to play online or offline. I would recommend to friends and family.  Great way to keep entertained
A11A9M2429MQ5E B007NZV2HK 5 1376438400 25 Word search is a very fun game to play, keeps the mind and brain entertained.  Would recommend to everyone that loves to play word games
A11ADBZ3C6V9L3 B00IZJLRQE 4 1405382400 10 It's a good game but can become aggravating real fast
A11ADBZ3C6V9L3 B00DHKKN6Q 4 1389139200 25 This game is very challenging but every enjoyable I love how the levels are set up and how it's different from the other bubble games
A11ADLIZSJFNYL B00702PZME 3 1393545600 32 I assumed once you complete the free games it would unlock the others one by one....not so.  You have to pay for all of them.  Probably won't continue to play this game.
A11ADLIZSJFNYL B00C8R8TZ6 4 1371772800 25 Had fun and worked a few brain cells too!  Fun to test my vocabulary!  My kids will enjoy it too.  Thanks for the free game!
A11ADLIZSJFNYL B00IS87HYI 5 1401494400 24 Glad this is available for Kindle!!!  Love to play this game on the computer and very happy to FINALLY see it available for Kindle.
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B00AE6XMHI 5 1354924800 23 lots of fun to pass the time away.  Great for kid's of any age so download a enjoy lots of fun and adventure.
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B004MC8CA2 5 1349395200 28 the Holy Bible gives me peace,it is the most interesting and amazing book you will ever read.  So when. you feel there is no hope read your Bible
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B00CMF27DE 5 1369526400 20 if you like bingo then you are going tojust love this bingo game.  Simple to understand and lots of fun.
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B00CLVQ8GG 5 1368316800 33 this Bingo game is tons of fun.  I am better with 2 cards at a time because it seems.  to go faster it could just be me.  But I highly recommend this game.
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B006JPS1OM 5 1347926400 31 once you get into this game you don't want to stop playing.  the graphics are great and my kids liked it too so give it a try you will enjoy it.
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B005YIPHL0 5 1353801600 28 I greatly enjoy reading daily prayers.  It brings me closer to God and I feel at peace. There are so many wonderful prayers and for just about everything.
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B00A4KVFLY 5 1354147200 21 this game is a lot of fun.  I think trying it with a friend on facebook will be even more exciting
A11AFIVCWL0UN9 B008NCUFYS 5 1354060800 23 this game is a blast.  the kids will really enjoy it.so when your feeling tired of other games give paplinko a try. .;)
A11AI6BWJBR258 B0097EWK3A 4 1368403200 24 I would like to see a longer intro. Need longer intro.  Makes me wonder if the full game will be short also. Good mystery.
A11AI6BWJBR258 B00AIQP9DE 5 1373328000 24 Very visually entertaining.  Keeps a fast pace that calls to you to continue .  Not sure yet if it is worth the highend pricing:-)
A11AI6BWJBR258 B0084DYNGC 5 1369008000 23 Difficult enough to stay interesting.  Unusual graphics pleasing to look at while searching.  I would buy the full version, and new ones added.
A11AI6BWJBR258 B00HJ4G1MQ 4 1391212800 47 I do enjoy this companies games, but this doesn't live up to your others.  Not only that, but the price tag  is beyond what I would pay.  Let me know when it goes on sale.  Maybe then I won't mind paying for the rest of the game.
A11AJWMFS4ZY3S B00HFTHXMC 4 1394150400 28 Nice game to pass time. Requires thinking and planning ahead as the levels go by. Great for those who just feel happy after accomplishing a puzzle game win.
A11AJWMFS4ZY3S B009HKL4B8 5 1382832000 49 I've been hearing about the Sims games for years but never had the interest to play. Saw this in the kindle fire app store and decided to give it try. I say, totally worth your time if you love games and that's all it will cost because it's FREE!
A11AJWMFS4ZY3S B00BPC23XO 4 1399075200 67 Been a great game to pass the time when waiting so far. Really enjoyed playing on my kindle fire. The picture quality is good so you don't have to be guessing what a pic is showing you. I'm only at level 2 so it's still fairly easy. Will see what the next levels bring.Recommend for 10 and up so far, especially those who love guessing/word puzzle games.
A11AJWMFS4ZY3S B00BP29SAA 5 1382140800 96 I got this app to keep my baby brother occupied and boy did it ever! I could hardly get my kindle from him when I need it. Easy to use,  he (4 yrs old) figured out many of the activities without my help.  Got him excited and more observant when next we went to the supermarket so I would say he learnt something from this game. I would recommend this app to anyone who just wants a fun game for their kids that will grab their attention and keep them occupied for not  than 10 mins!
A11AJWMFS4ZY3S B00FAPF5U0 5 1384732800 35 Fun game, great to pass the time when you just need a distraction. Takes some brain power at some levels but luck is a big help too :) Highly addictive. Definitely recommend. Plus it's FREE!
A11AM35BX7UBKE B00E4WVYR8 5 1384646400 29 Like a crossword puzzle with colors. The colors are provided put each color into the correct space. Puzzles range from single row to multiple rows. Very fun and challenging.
A11AM35BX7UBKE B009C7ZQM4 5 1386806400 26 Sadly I am uniformed about much of this knowledge but this app helps my kindle fire HD run smoother, is easy to use, and was free.
A11AM35BX7UBKE B008IXP8IU 5 1378166400 54 This game is so addicting. It is a free app that comes with a few &#34;packs&#34; free, there are daily free puzzles. You can purchase more packs when you get through the free ones, and with several purchases you get bonus free packs. If you like word games, letter games this is for you.
A11AM35BX7UBKE B008245WE0 3 1378166400 30 This is a great app, fun to look at, can set time, realistic rain sound--- but you have to keep the app and tablet/phone open/on for the app to run...
A11ANM1EILSVJI B0067R0APK 4 1364256000 24 love this ap..does all it claims plus..but, always a but...screen icon is ugly with logo and big red salebanner..why???  come onchange that ugli icon..
A11ANM1EILSVJI B00EBE8MUG 3 1376265600 69 as someone else stated, this is and could be a real fun game with one drawback..If you get a stumper you cannot advance to next TV show..It would be nice to advance and then go back to the stumper. As a side note what if you don't have facebook, ya I know who dosent, well some dont..the 5 I got correct were fun...now time to delete of my Kindle.
A11ANM1EILSVJI B0064X7B4A 4 1362960000 32 luv the game..i must be insane, 12 games at a time, hooked cant stop....now if i could pay for aversion without ads for my kindle fire hdi would give a 5 star.
A11AQYG029LJTE B00AMRIZYY 1 1357171200 25 It is ok. It is kind of boring you can't do anything! This is something that stinks after you have played it once or twice.
A11AQYG029LJTE B009HHX414 4 1358640000 68 I like this app. I can communicate with family and friends! It is great!! But it can be frustrating. I can't change my friends number to his name, and I can't get his photo in either. Also it shows a couple ways to express your self with faces but they are not good. But over all it is a great app! I do recommend this app for everyone.
A11AQYG029LJTE B008Y0REKC 5 1357776000 22 It is so fun!! They are cute and cuddly  little monsters. It is the best game ever!! I recommend it for everyone.
A11AQYG029LJTE B00BW08XRO 5 1369612800 20 It is a fun addicting game!  You can't put it down. It is for you to get and to love.
A11AQYG029LJTE B009G9KFQ0 5 1369612800 91 Well I just got this today and was on it for 5 minutes and I love it! It tells you if it is a good day for games outside, for exercise. It tells you what the weeks forecast is, this is the best one you can get. It has pictures, it has maps and it knows where you are so it gives you the correct forecast. It isn't one that goes for the largest city near you. It is updated all the time! So this is the weather, no everything APP!
A11AQYG029LJTE B00G5LQ5MU 5 1385078400 42 I think this is a fun app. I love titanic stories and this is as close as I can get to having my own! I recommend this for people who are bored or has free time. Fun app I totally recommend it!
A11ARZPI2V20LY B00HHBXYGM 5 1400803200 27 I really like this game especially because it's fast paced and you don't have to think, you just race your fingers around til you clear the board.
A11ATZ5V6DG2DP B00B4LFMGG 5 1387238400 53 This app works so well on Kindle Fire! Other Drudge app I used had to reset every time I goggles between a headline and its story. This one gives a start to the story then you can go to the webpage for more info. Totally stressfree by not having to wait for reset!
A11AUOBC1J9FNK B0094FYBB6 5 1358208000 31 great app for kindle fire. graphics are crystal clear. fun word scramble game. i would like to be able to earn coins quicker and the cost of characters and accessories cheaper
A11AUOBC1J9FNK B007MRQOXQ 5 1358208000 30 i check this app on the daily! I have been learned so much about my kindle fire and gotten SO many free app and books from this app. THank U
A11AUOBC1J9FNK B006PK2TEE 3 1358208000 20 works well on kindle fire . traditional word search. not many options for challenge. easy to use. fun fun fun
A11AUOBC1J9FNK B004DLNC4I 5 1358208000 21 Scanner works well on Kindle Fire. Buffering pauses the scans, but overall a good app. Lots of locations to choose from
A11AUOBC1J9FNK B008AZGWYK 5 1358208000 20 Wonderful ap for Kindle Fire. Easy to use. Great information for a variety of illnesses and ailemanets. highly recommend! great
A11AVMNA57GANH B00DYY92MG 3 1375574400 23 Managed to guess quite a few, but it is easy to get frustrated and want to spend money for answers. Great nostalgia piece.
A11AVMNA57GANH B00BPC23XO 4 1370476800 22 Sometimes tricky, especially with the first picture. This is a good way to .  increase your brain usage. FUN For all ages.
A11AVMNA57GANH B008YRVW0I 4 1398988800 24 Very addictive play. Very much like the computer version in play.  Only difference is the size of aquarium beauty items are not size adjustable.
A11AZ3QOODH062 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1391817600 29 I wanted flappy bride but since I couldn't find it on the Kindle app store I settled for this and this is AWESOME I can't put down my Kindle.
A11AZ3QOODH062 B008Y7SMQU 3 1370649600 34 this game was not what I expected it to be I thought it was going to be correct spelling and more well known logos I would recomend it but not to very many people
A11AZ3QOODH062 B00529IOXO 1 1355616000 22 I wouldn't even give it one star it said that o was not eligable to use text plus I reccomend text now
A11B2627XDGRS5 B009HKL4B8 4 1352332800 56 Until my Sims got deleted I liked this game. The only thing that I dont like is that unlike the fb app the Sims cant do more than one task at a time. If your planting something that takes 1 day to grow your Sims becomes unavailable for that time frame. Other than that, thumbs up!
A11B2627XDGRS5 B00GIZO674 5 1388707200 26 Fun game. Keeps you on your toes. Not too expensive to upgrade to the full version compared to others games. Enjoyable and passes the time quickly.
A11B2627XDGRS5 B00BW08XRO 4 1375315200 26 ONE of my favorite cooking games. Lots of fun. Much easier to play on kindle than on my computer.Wish the full version wasn't 5 bucks though.
A11B2627XDGRS5 B006OCM0G0 3 1376611200 102 Why are all the items SO expensive?!?! Just when I think I have enough coin saved to decorate the game asks you go and buy 8 $20000 tables. Sure it's fictional money but how can we advance when we have to spend all of our coin on decorations to complete goals? Teamlava should consider reducing the item pricing in the game or give us more coin for each item served. Also some of the cooking times are ridiculous. Starting to think this is a ploy to get people to spend real money. Not cool if it's supposed to be a free game.
A11B2627XDGRS5 B00AK2RHR2 4 1374969600 29 First experience with a dash game and I love it! Wish there was one price to unlock whole game. Doing it by parts turns out paying more than expected.
A11B4YPPUV0M2V B007XKEY6Q 3 1397433600 25 I bought the app for the kids.  I donot use it but they seemed to like it.  I think they may have stopped using it.
A11B4YPPUV0M2V B0058VW36U 3 1397433600 26 I bought the app for the kids.  I do not use it but they seemed to like it.  I think they may have stopped using it.
A11B4YPPUV0M2V B005V1N71W 5 1397433600 93 I am one of the first subscribers of Sirius satellite radio (within the first year of it starting).  Pandora is probably going to be my new paid service.  I can play and listen to pretty much everything I want too.  Sirius has kind of become just like the free radio stations.  If and when Howard Stern leaves I will probably get rid of my subscription but even then Howard seems like he is just phoning in his show so I am really thinking about cancelling my subscription with Sirius and going with Pandora.
A11B4YPPUV0M2V B008XG1X18 5 1397433600 20 What can I say my wife loves this app and what she likes ....I LIKE!  I think that simple enough...
A11B543NFOTZIG B006OP8494 5 1382918400 37 This gives me access to so many publications from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I can read on any subject articles and thoughts from others. Highly recommend it to those searching for answers.
A11B543NFOTZIG B00E9A656K 1 1392595200 23 Was too difficult and I uninstalled it. My grandson is 6 but didn't like it. Not something for the younger tikes to play.
A11B6W6V25QZ82 B00CH87HF4 4 1404864000 14 Great app, this is one of those games that entices you to keep playing.
A11B78EHEXMSDW B005ZFOOE8 2 1357084800 31 Not for me but this is a good thing. But I like Pandora. Its nothing against this app I just already had something. I only had it for a second tho.
A11B78EHEXMSDW B007JYI4SU 3 1357084800 24 Its defiantly not proven to be correct but its fun to mess with when your bored. And you get to play with others too.
A11B78EHEXMSDW B00HDRTGDK 4 1399161600 30 It is simple 90s stuff fun fun fun. We really like playing it. We actually laugh and play this game as a family so technically mommy daddy always win haha
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B0091QSNEE 5 1395100800 48 As with all Dr panda games, my 4 year old loves this game. She spent all her free time playing this game, and I think she mastered all the tasks the first day.This will certainly keep kids entertained if you have to wait with them for appointments, etc.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00CSR2J9I 4 1390867200 40 I thought the game looked a little cheesy at first, and I almost didn't install it. It's a blast, but wow it can be difficult to keep from flipping. I don't see myself getting tired of the game anytime soon.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B0087FMUCQ 4 1387497600 36 I have the original flick golf, and this really steps up the difficulty. Moving tees, buildings, cranes, helicopters, and swimming pools. Not the kind of obstacles that you should normally encounter on a normal golf game.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00GY0HJ4K 3 1390867200 27 Thankfully this was free, because it's an OK app. The tutorials can be a pain, and sometimes limit the moves you can make which is very annoying.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00AQX1KFU 2 1384387200 68 I picked this up as the faotd, and thought there would be a lot more for my daughter to do. It turns out that there are multiple chapters of this game, and each one costs $3 to unlock. There is no way in game to unlock them by earning achievements, so forking over money is the only way. I'm hoping my daughter loses interest so I can uninstall.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00CXVX1OQ 5 1384387200 85 I think the title says it all. You're a monkey (dressed up in funny clothes) and you get the beat the snot out of other monkeys dressed in even funnier looking clothes.This is also a super fast action game. If you let your guard down, at least in more advanced levels, you will be on the mat in no time. Then you can say/brag/sulk that you were KO'ed by a monkey with a clown nose and mohawk.I think I'll have to go play some more...
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B008469DGY 4 1384387200 79 I grabbed this game since I love golf, and since you only get one shot at each hole location, this is a super fast game.My issue, and I could probably just practice more, is that I have only been able to advance so far, and now it is just getting frustrating. I don't play it as much as I used to, so it will always be frustrating, so it will probably get uninstalled the next time I need space.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00EDF43MY 3 1384387200 93 As with other Dr Panda games, my 4 year old can play this for hours. This proves useful for doctors appointments, and other boring (for kids) moments in life.My only real complaint about the game is that is requires an internet connection. My 4 year old doesn't read yet, so I disable wifi before she gets to play, so she doesn't buy something she shouldn't. If the game is for kids, then turn off requirement for internet access. If that stipulation gets removed with an update, then I will rate at 5 stars.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00A8ECU24 1 1384387200 25 I went to install, and my antivirus about blew up from adware. I'm certain my daughter would have loved this, but we will never know.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B00GRXA7GG 4 1395100800 22 I got this as the faotd, and I like it. The tiles are crisp and clean, and it's an easy time waster.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B008HSOT18 4 1384387200 82 I never enjoyed lugging around electronic battleship as a kid, plus I would always lose the pegs or ships, so it became very hard to play. But I don't have to worry about that now. I can carry the game in my pocket, and play to my hearts content.You can increase difficulty of AI, and adjust the number of ships to use, to add to the fun.This game is pretty straight forward and quick, so it's good for short bursts of boardom.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B008J8OH5O 4 1384387200 67 I love that other dice game that plays the same, but this one is much easier to play on the bus without losing my dice.This plays exactly like a game of yahtzee, except you get 6 dice so you get a few more options like 3 pair and 2 - 3 of a kinds.It's fun, and quick without having to breakout scorecards, and dice, and a pen.
A11B8E73SPX4V8 B009MO89Y4 3 1384387200 44 This is a great game and my daughter loves it, but either invest in headphones for your kid or ear plugs for you.The games/goals are pretty simple, but the music is insanely annoying. But other than that issue, it's a nice game for kids.
A11B9Q2LVVFOAU B00IKZX1ZI 5 1401408000 20 This is a great app that is very addicting.  My kids especially love it!  Definitely recommend you to buy it.
A11B9Q2LVVFOAU B0063IH60K 5 1401408000 23 I really enjoy playing this app.  It really gets you thinking and working to win.  I play over and over.  Definitely recommend it.
A11B9Q2LVVFOAU B008XG1X18 5 1401408000 23 This is one of the best apps out there.  Pinterest has provided so many great ideas for me in many situations.  Get it!!
A11B9Q2LVVFOAU B0094BB4TW 5 1401408000 25 This is a great app that I like having on my kindle fire.  You can do all of the normal things on facebook from here.
A11B9Q2LVVFOAU B004HGK6FW 5 1401408000 20 I really enjoy playing this app.  It really gets you thinking and working to get more points.  Definitely recommend it.
A11BD687U05UA0 B008FETAQS 5 1341360000 20 I loved this game.  the concept and story line and great together.  I highly recommend it.  its an awesome game.
A11BD687U05UA0 B007ZGO7EM 5 1340582400 21 excellent.  this is a simple to use but highly versitile app.  the large buttons make it easy to use for anyone.
A11BD687U05UA0 B0085N9I84 4 1343865600 36 the game is fun.  most of the monsters are downright adorable.  my concerns are with the fact that the number of monsters and quests that require gold are very high and require high amounts of it.
A11BD687U05UA0 B00CKW6FVE 5 1370476800 41 This game is really a fun game to play and the user interface is really easy to use.  The game actually shows you how the piece will fit and you just select the outline you want and it pops into place.
A11BD687U05UA0 B005XQLBU4 3 1377302400 39 This is a OK game. The graphics are pretty simple but the game play is pretty straight forward.  It's ok for a free game but I don't think I would have been happy if I had paid for it.
A11BD687U05UA0 B009NG7R3K 4 1356134400 22 the concept is rather cute.  over all I would recommend it as a great time killer.  you should give it a try.
A11BD687U05UA0 B00785P2QC 5 1340582400 41 virtual city play ground is a cute and fun little game.  I really enjoy playing it.  the only complaint it have is the slow build up of &quot;investment &quot; points needed to get most of the good things for your city
A11BD687U05UA0 B00DJFIMW6 4 1374192000 42 The game itself is fun.  But I made a purchase that was supposed to give me double bananas in the game.  I have yet to get this.  I contacted Gameloft support and have yet to get a satisfactory response out of them.
A11BGNHPV1FUZM B006ON41FC 5 1329523200 21 great game, easy to play,  open feint can be turned off, don't believe the conspirators, definitely worth a dollar! nineteen twenty
A11BGNHPV1FUZM B005FY19WE 5 1318809600 22 fun game for $1.  no problems on galaxy tab.  played all 60 levels, definitely challenging enough to keep me interested.  good controls
A11BGNHPV1FUZM B00DJFIMW6 1 1377043200 33 Game took an hour to load, then always trying to get you make in game purchases for more coins or some crap. Horrible concept, and just trying to get money out of you.
A11BKTQKBO1SCF B009G9KFQ0 4 1354924800 36 works great on my galaxy s but on my kindle fire it is kinda funky. Will not scroll up or down and the radar doesn't function right. if this. could be fixed that would be great.
A11BKTQKBO1SCF B00DHQHQCE 5 1402185600 34 Was looking for clash of clans and found this nugget. Hard to get started and build up, but once you get a feel for it and get your troops trained it's addictive as hell!
A11BKTQKBO1SCF B0069G5Z9K 5 1347235200 27 i love this game. no in app purchases, you just pick it up and play. and doable tasks. get this game for adult or for a kid.
A11BKTQKBO1SCF B00FB13Y74 4 1400716800 65 really enjoy all the angry birds games, and was excited about go! played really well and was easy to figure out, but since the last update it has glitched out. i can usually run one race,but after that it boots me. if i go back and try to run that race again it boots me. Rovio --- please fix this. it is driving me nuts!!
A11BMPF18Z3JR6 B006OC2ANS 5 1330819200 22 blood and glory is so fun you get to fight there is not really any blood you can buy potion's armor shields
A11BMPF18Z3JR6 B0054JZC6E 5 1327363200 21 the game is so fun and I mean it the games are so fun my brother and sister love it to
A11BMPF18Z3JR6 B004TP2E7O 5 1328486400 23 gun bros is so fun you get to shoot robots and you can buy guns and armorial and powerups there are big monsters
A11BMPF18Z3JR6 B005UQ9FNC 5 1325721600 23 bird land is so fun It somewhat. teaches you how to take care of a bird with all the colors of the birds
A11BMPF18Z3JR6 B00AREIAI8 5 1367020800 22 This game is amazing! You should really get it. You can buy different horses. You can compete in compotitions. I recommend it.
A11BMPL8IBUWTJ B0058VCGXU 5 1342396800 22 I used it to take out my kidney.  you can make a lot of money selling kidneys.  it is worth every penny.
A11BNDCNC6E3TD B006OC2ANS 5 1332201600 20 This game is really really fun!  I love gladiators and this game is totally freaking awesome!!! Love it! Love it!
A11BNDCNC6E3TD B005UQ9FNC 5 1332115200 20 fun app!!!  I think this app is really really fun and the birds are just too cute!!!  I love it:)
A11BNDCNC6E3TD B0081IRIKI 5 1338076800 20 I think this is a fun game!  I love to play it!!  It totally keeps me engrossed and very entertained.
A11BNDCNC6E3TD B00B2TET3C 4 1374105600 67 I really love to play bingo and this game is definitely not a disappointment!!  I love cats and the beach too so I can't put this down...the only downfall of this game is running out of bingo bucks if you don't win so you have to wait until the next day to get more bingo bucks to play again...unless you want to buy them with real money.
A11BNT23HV0IT2 B00ASSF19Y 5 1358035200 19 really fun. love the hair styles and clothesthe shoes make the outfits complete.and I think it is so amazing.
A11BNT23HV0IT2 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1402358400 27 this game is harder than flappy birds because it glitches and only lets me go to 2.so my opinion is it isn't that good of a game.
A11BNT23HV0IT2 B00DUGCLY4 5 1404000000 33 it is a awesome game and I love it. is very very very fun. if you like guesssing games you should look at this game and git it if you like guessing games
A11BNT23HV0IT2 B005HSL626 5 1403481600 28 so fun and I love it soooooooooo much. I like just swiping my finger on the screen. so I think anyone who wants to play a good.awesome game.
A11BNUWO0UY8E6 B00ABGEFWC 5 1394064000 41 This game is great. Me and my kids love it. I hate that I had to reinstall it. But I sill LOVE it. Anyone that wants to add me my ID is 88b025. It's a game for all ages. Very addictive.
A11BNUWO0UY8E6 B0060D80NU 5 1366588800 26 This is a really cool game. I have really enjoyed playing it. It is one of the more interesting games I have played in a while.
A11BNUWO0UY8E6 B008OOYALE 5 1366588800 20 I looooovvvvveeeee this game. It is by far one of my favorites it's fun for kids and adults. Very addictive.
A11BNUWO0UY8E6 B00CPPXYC4 5 1369267200 23 I love this game. It is very addictive. This is a must have game. It's so FUN you may get lost in it.
A11BNUWO0UY8E6 B007SYWFRM 5 1366243200 26 This is a very cute and fun game for all ages. However, this game is so FUN it can be addictive if not played with care.
A11BNUWO0UY8E6 B006PH7WBM 5 1367366400 26 I LOVE THIS GAME. ONE OF THE MORE FUN GAMES I HAVE PLAYED. It is a very addictive game. It is slow moving but worth it.
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B008JK6W5K 5 1358121600 37 Definitely one of the better logo quiz games. I play this game about two hours a day. The best part is if I don't know the answers my husband or one of my kids does. Great fun!
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B00I6WBHD8 5 1393113600 20 I have only been playing this game for a few hands but it is very fun so far. Fun, fun.
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B00AR1AUAW 4 1358812800 32 I really like this game. Would of liked a few more hints that's why the four star. Would have given five but I don't like to pay for hints,would rather earn them.
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B006QC53WG 3 1397779200 32 Well I downloaded this game because I love card games but so far it looks like you have to repeat slot of levels to move forward or of course spend real money
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B00HFTHXMC 4 1391385600 28 I really like this game, but I am only giving it four stars because I hate having to ask people for help to get to the next levelRebecca
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366329600 21 It's fun but the cartoon type posters make it to hard with out hints. I won't be buying the full version.
A11BZJRAW8NE8Q B00BX736EG 4 1368576000 25 I like the game but I wish they would not be so cheap about giving out coins  I will not be buying any coins .
A11C25KIECVHG9 B007DKC922 5 1331424000 24 cute game......fun to squash those little bugs kids will enjoy as well as adults and its free just get it you wont be disappointed
A11C25KIECVHG9 B006ICEDIO 4 1329523200 28 it is a fun game with cute sound effects.....great game to pass the time while waiting for appointments............. get if what do u have to loose its free!!!!
A11C25KIECVHG9 B00AMEFZ72 5 1378684800 23 fun game really enjoy playing the games sometimes are not easy at all and coins are hard to earn other than that fun
A11C4W6CKS6R8Q B0064X7B4A 5 1364601600 56 Words With Friends is one of the best free apps available. The only drawback is the ability to exit a game you accidentally started without having to forfeit. Sometimes at the end of a game both players hit rematch. If you don't want to play 2 games one of you has to forfeit.  Otherwise great app!
A11C4W6CKS6R8Q B00AMEYWYE 5 1356739200 33 For a free app this game rocks!!!!  Similar to Birdland.  Hopefully it'll keep having new ways to play. It would be a little more fun if the pets actually played with the toys.
A11C4W6CKS6R8Q B00A4KVFLY 1 1360281600 117 My son asked me to download this app so we could play each other.  Its not like Words With Friends or Dice With Buddies where you can choose your opponent. It randomly chooses opponents. You can "challenge" friends but you don't really play against them. The answers are ridiculous and often the answer you type doesn't count because it didn't exactly match word for word - the logic programming sucks. The time given to answer is completely unacceptable, especially in the Fast Money round. And final complaint - it slowed down my son's phone enormously and it can't be moved to SD card so he eventually uninstalled it. Bottom line: don't waste your time or app space!
A11C4W6CKS6R8Q B00ESNW58K 3 1386547200 78 This is a fun game but the challenges take too long to achieve.Building bridges, saving animals, upgrading structures are difficult. It seems like it takes so many different components to finish something that you never get ahead. It feels like they want you to purchase items as opposed to finding or earning them. This app is definitely NOT for children as they would not have the patience to wait 5 or 6 hours to achieve a simple goal.
A11C53RSEI8I5D B0062P7SSY 1 1322611200 26 This looked fun, but it won't download on my Droid X over 3G or wifi. If I get it to work, I will change my review.
A11C53RSEI8I5D B005023UTG 2 1318550400 24 This isn't better than the original. The screen shakes way too much (I don't think it should at all). It's slow and inaccurate also.
A11C53RSEI8I5D B004N8R576 5 1313366400 24 There hasn&apos;t been a single force close for me. This app works great on my Droid X. It&apos;s fun after the slight learning curve.
A11C53RSEI8I5D B005V20JKI 2 1322006400 40 The game was sort of fun until I started unlocking characters that sucked worse than the ones you start with. Some characters are near impossible to use and there is an immense lag. This could have been fun. Too bad.
A11C53RSEI8I5D B004RJ6978 4 1321747200 66 Takes some getting used to. I would like a faster function to get to where I need to write things down. The note app I use is fast, but doesn't work that we'll. Speed is the only problem. Also, it would be nice to have a setting to turn off all of the extra functions that get in the way. All in all, worth the price.
A11C967L9KOACW B00DJFIMW6 4 1388707200 55 Don't believe all the reviews saying it won't work because it is something wrong with their device and if it doesn't work for you then  there is something wrong with your device too. The only problem is when I clearly swipe to make the minion move it sometimes doesn't work for me otherwise gr8 game.
A11C967L9KOACW B005X9498M 1 1402358400 23 It won't let you swipe in between page things it is just the one you see get the one that is iPhone 5
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00AEJM6H2 4 1393718400 27 Action can be fast or slow...I like to challenge myself to make higher scores.  A fun way to spend some time and enjoyable at the same time.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00B51MR4U 5 1379808000 32 Hours of amusement.  Not clear money amount and coin amount but it is still a lot of fun. The bonus round is great.  Would recommend to anyone who loves to play slots.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B0081JPTXK 5 1394064000 25 Totally amusing...good payouts...is a bit slow on my kindle fire but it might be my appliance.  Anyway, a super time should be had by all.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00HFTHXMC 5 1403222400 23 Love the graphics and colors.  Not quite as challenging at beginning but watch out as you progress.  Thoroughly enjoyed for hours of  playing.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00GY0HJ4K 3 1400544000 38 Got to level 20...told to free jelly in a slime ball but no directions on how to do this.  Maybe I have to buy coins? I find this problem with several games but can usually figure it out.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00IKZX1ZI 4 1394928000 22 Keeps one moving...kids should love it.  I am a senior senior and am delighted to play.  The colors and graphics are amazing.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00CJ77HU8 5 1394496000 22 Fast paced...keeps you moving...no dull moments.  Love when the egg comes down...just athoroughly satisfying way to pass time in a fun way.
A11CED9CVCRYCW B00FEIX5OG 5 1383868800 42 This game is definitely addictive!!!  I thought I was hooked on the slot games but this is SO much more I interesting...it makes you think quite a bit.  Looks difficult but play  a few games and you're on your wayto total enjoyment.
A11CEGS0750Y1R B00JV858HM 5 1404777600 29 I enjoy playing this game at the end of the day.  it is relaxing to find the words that fit each column and the little red fish is cute.
A11CF1V823RNGT B00GCT92CU 4 1397952000 23 This is the third game in this series that I have downloaded.  It is challenging, yet fun.  Take a chance and pay on.
A11CF1V823RNGT B00D0VA0UQ 4 1398038400 23 Love this game.  It is very addictive.  I could play it all day long.  Some words are tough but most are fairly easy.
A11CF1V823RNGT B00EBE8MUG 4 1399334400 20 Just started playing this game tonight.  It is fun but also challenging.  I look forward to playing it some more.
A11CF1V823RNGT B00CAW96DI 5 1396656000 20 Fun to play. Keep me busy.  Try it.  Waste some time.  Great.  Play all day.  Should be asleep.  More fun.
A11CF1V823RNGT B00COVCV50 4 1400889600 21 Great fun for families.  My son loves playing it with me.  Quick game.  Tons of fun! Recommend this game to all.
A11CF1V823RNGT B00BX736EG 5 1397174400 21 This game is great fun.  It is challenging and makes you think.  I can spend hours playing it.  Get it today!
A11CGW97DKKD89 B00BG3ID0Y 5 1364169600 24 This gave keeps me entertained for some time. It can really make you think at some points and st others it is so easy.
A11CGW97DKKD89 B004SD5GZ4 5 1361836800 26 The only thing I wish this would have is an easier interface. Still I don't think it's too big of a deal, I just perfer simplicity.
A11CGW97DKKD89 B005FT0A8I 1 1361836800 55 Frustrating interface. It feels like too often I get one tile to start with and that is usually not what happens in other versions of this game. Also, when you press and hold you might accidently set off a flagged tile, which should not be possible. Worst version of this game I have ever played.
A11CGW97DKKD89 B00AR1AUAW 5 1376784000 23 The game really makes you think. Just when you think you have made the correct associations you realize that you were so wrong.
A11CGW97DKKD89 B004TTY694 4 1361836800 73 For free you couldn't ask for more. It would have helped if I knew that it saved as you went, because I was afraid for like 6 minutes when I couldn't find a save option. Finally, I figured they couldn't have forgotten such an important function so I hit the back arrow. Still it would have nice if there was notice in the app, or even a save button, that would be reassuring.
A11CHNJT1S2RZH B00FAPF5U0 5 1383782400 22 This game is lots of fun and quite addictive. I'm glad to finally have an app for the Kindle Fire. Love it!
A11CHNJT1S2RZH B009HKL4B8 5 1372550400 22 I love this game. I find myself playing it constantly. It's easy and free. Very addictive! My Sims ROCK!! Nice free app.
A11CHNJT1S2RZH B008K6G8CK 4 1355443200 31 This app installed quickly. The games are fun and you'll find yourself wasting a lot of time on it. :) You can also loving with your Facebook, Yahoo, or Goggle profiles.
A11CI3MERUW2LM B00FAPF5U0 1 1383436800 124 The 2 star says that it means I don't like it. That is not quite true. The game itself is really quite cute, fun, & addictive. It's the costly addictive part I don't like. Not being overly adept at games I am very annoyed that once you run through lives you have to wait a couple of hours to regenerate your lives. Oh wait, you can do it sooner at .99 cents/5 lives. Also, the power-ups cost additional money (from .99 cents to 1.99). Sorry, I prefer apps and games where I pay once and can play when I want as often as I want. Just got offline from buying some more Big Fish games. Much cheaper and just as much fun that way.
A11CI3MERUW2LM B0061S5NNO 3 1375228800 93 I would have given this app a much higher rating as it is easy to use. I've had it for over a year &amp; was pleased with the ability to add food. Unfortunately I have had to get breakfast a couple of times at McD. The app has a McD section but does not list McDs oatmeal. I could not find any instructions to see if the food base needed a refresh to display current menu items. So if you want an app to help you log eating out this is not it.
A11CJLAZBZ4MF8 B00FR84CB8 5 1389657600 20 Is a fun game as was the 1st addition of the game.  Keeps one wanting to go on and on
A11CJLAZBZ4MF8 B00FEIX5OG 5 1388016000 20 I love this game.  Is not as frustrating as others you can't seem to get past on levels....  Get it!
A11CJQ4BW7YAQS B00AA87JGU 4 1377561600 34 Fun and exciting puzzle game. First levels allow for success and encourage you to continue. Logic is the key. Try combining and dismantle you might be surprised. I find these games fun and entertaining.
A11CJQ4BW7YAQS B00AREIAI8 5 1360627200 22 Really entertaining very nice graphics.horses are easy to train and the help is very easy to understand. Quick ways to gain levels.
A11CMT1RJR8P99 B006QMNQ6Q 5 1359417600 69 I went looking for Text Twist for my Android phone.  Found it, but lots of the reviews indicated there were problems with the game.  In reading through the reviews, one reviewer mentioned Jumbline 2, and how much better it worked for Android.So I got it for my phone, and I also have it on my Kindle!!  It is loads of fun and I haven't had one problem with it.
A11CMT1RJR8P99 B0063M22QO 3 1362009600 84 I have been playing Mahjong for a long time.  Naturally, I wanted it on my new Kindle.  The one I purchased for $.99 is just way too easy.  I can run through a game in 5 or less minutes.  I think I am going to ditch this one and see if I can find something a little more complex.I do, however, like the fact that when there are no more moves left, it gives you the option of shuffling the tiles to produce more.
A11COHG3O3GP40 B0066T8SDU 5 1377820800 33 I have been waiting and waiting for SCRABBLE for Kindle Fire since I received my Kindle Fire.  Now that it is here, it is FANTASTIC!  It certainly was worth the wait.  Thank you!
A11COHG3O3GP40 B00E8KLWB4 3 1395792000 105 I was looking for another hidden objects game.  This one is very nice with excellent graphics, and lots of activities.  Perhaps too much?  I also am very confused about the way that one obtains objects/reaches level in order to progress to the next level.  It just happens, not really any explanation.  There are many many instructions, however, they are flashed rather quickly, and there are many words like &#34;avatar&#34; in these instructions, that really need to be further explained.  I also find that the time limit is well very limiting, unless you're willing to purchase more time.  Great game however it is much too complicated!
A11COOR82DMW6C B00AQX1KFU 3 1393027200 26 Program is very nice, graphics are great but it is best to buy it if you want to play it properly.  The free part isn't much.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00ELV0WF2 5 1395014400 27 This is a lot of fun and very addictive.  Great game for the waiting rooms and for playing in the car.  Easy, nice graphics, and fast play.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00I6WBHD8 4 1392940800 57 This is a fun but frustrating game.  I enjoy playing but you run out of lives quickly and have to wait a number of minutes for another life or use your coins to buy more lives.  I appreciate those who develop games and you should get rewarded for it but this game is greedy.  Love it anyway.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00EDEMLTW 5 1383004800 23 Love this game great fun. Absorbing  play is fast and most levels are achievable nice graphics can't believe it is free  get this
A11COOR82DMW6C B00G5LQ5MU 2 1393027200 26 Just felt it was too restricting.  Not that challenging and of course, you have to pay for the game eventually if you want to complete it.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00FATEJYE 2 1393027200 23 This did not work on my Kindle.  It might have been good - don't know.  It took a while to download for nothing.
A11COOR82DMW6C B008K6G8CK 1 1393027200 22 Just another app game that tries to get you addicted then get you to spend money on silly games.  Graphics were ok.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00AU13VA0 5 1393027200 38 I have the 7 wonders for my Pc so I knew these apps would probably be good for my Kindle.  Very addictive, challenging, and attractive.  Of all the match 3 games the 7 Wonders series are the best.
A11COOR82DMW6C B0097HSS4M 4 1378080000 32 This is a simple editing program that is easy to use.  Not a lot of options but what it does provide is fun and easy.  A red eye would have been nice.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00E46D1QQ 4 1378080000 22 My three year old nephew likes playing this game.  It is definitely exercising his brain.  Good game for kids.  I recommend it.
A11COOR82DMW6C B0089BPEZS 3 1397520000 123 I use HBO GO on my Kindle Fire so I can watch the programs I want when I want.  It is nice to have but HBO could do a little work to make it easier to move around in the program.  For instance, I am catching up on Game of Thrones starting with season 1.  Every time I open HBO GO I have to put in a search for Game to get to the seasons even though I leave HBO with that on my Kindle.  Sometimes it will just give me the current season with no way to go backwards.  Still, I am happy to have it - just wish navigating the site was easier or that the app would retain my history.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00FYHXMQS 5 1387929600 21 This is a fun game.  It starts easy then really challenges your patience.  Some puzzles seem impossible but stick with it.
A11COOR82DMW6C B009HUB40Y 2 1393027200 21 Too much going on.  I love match three but this one just had too much and the graphics were too small.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00CAM8YL8 4 1393027200 35 I downloaded several of their apps and I like them all.  Sure, it's the old carrot on a stick - they offer one meditation and you have to pay for more but they are good.
A11COOR82DMW6C B008IXP8IU 5 1393027200 21 I love brain games and this is a really good brain game.  Helps to improve your vocabulary while you have fun.
A11COOR82DMW6C B00AEJM6H2 5 1393027200 22 This is challenging to the point of being frustrating but I like that.  ITreeGamer is becoming one of my favorite game makes.
A11COZ145TP53N B008IJTFYW 5 1348185600 41 I like this app more than sleepy time I like how easy it is to play more than 1 sound at once. I think my favorite part of this app is that is has a special sound that gives you dreams.
A11COZ145TP53N B004Q3CJQ0 4 1332374400 49 this app has a neat little widget where I click on it and immediately the screen turned bright and I was planning to rate it five stars. but when I turned it on a second time it asked me to rate it five stars (blocking most of the light).
A11COZ145TP53N B004SVMNXY 5 1333584000 18 pretty fun app free an only &frac12; a megabyte.was is not to like!thank you for reading this review!!
A11COZ145TP53N B00918L02E 5 1351987200 33 this game J's for totally little kids... but is still fun and very additive and funny would recomend this all if you want to kill time and not want to take up storage.
A11COZ145TP53N B009GXHOW4 5 1354060800 42 you shroud definitely get this app if you have Minecraft pocket edition. it is really cool you can add any item in your inventory. you can change from creative and survival! change the name of your map and much more! very satisfied.
A11COZ145TP53N B007D2XSW0 5 1340323200 32 they listened and fixed everything! great app please get, thanks! this is one of the best (if not the best) editing app I have just got and is really easy to use!
A11COZ145TP53N B0054JZC6E 4 1327881600 26 I like it because the games don&rsquo;t cost real money that you unlock. Some of the games are boring. Besides it's a pretty fun game :)
A11COZ145TP53N B004Z9Y3VY 4 1326931200 23 it was what I expected except the red button was not in the middle of the screen so I took away on star
A11COZ145TP53N B004UID2LC 5 1327968000 24 this is the best app ever!!! I Dp not know why people are saying it is a virusamazon would not let you download it
A11COZ145TP53N B006OIK6JC 5 1335398400 21 it was my brothers birthday and he loved it!the only thing that would be better was if you could print it
A11COZ145TP53N B0051HL5Q0 4 1327795200 22 the game was too easy to complete which made it boring after a while. but besides that ir was a fun game
A11COZ145TP53N B004SCR8QU 5 1327968000 36 The pro version has been removed from the amazon app store because it was not working properly. The problem has not been fixed so please use &quot;SketchBook Mobile Express&quot; untill the problem is fixed... (if ever).
A11COZ145TP53N B005X9498M 5 1349049600 71 I gave this app 5 stars so the 1 star people will not count.this app looks like a &quot;Ipad Mini&quot; and some of the apps use your own apps like email. The only thing is it is not even close too as good as Go Launcher Ex which is what I use for normal use not just fooling my friends (which I can do if I set my wallpaper as raindrops).
A11COZ145TP53N B007MPAVS2 3 1346198400 21 okay game pretty additcive kinda longer time to get the feel for it but I want to onluck more fruit mode..
A11COZ145TP53N B0071PARPA 5 1340064000 68 just to sort things out here... you CAN zoom you just have to press MENU. anyway, I love this app, and not only because it has so many colors it also has A LOT of tools as well. my personal favorite is the sketchy tool which makes any drawing you draw look so good! please get it its my favorite drawing app! please please help them out, thanks!
A11COZ145TP53N B004LOMB2Q 3 1346889600 28 I really like the app but I hate the permissions!this app is good but I really wish I could get that read clearly app on Amazon... all well
A11COZ145TP53N B004SCG69A 5 1327190400 18 This game has many levels and many weapons!This app is great for anyone who likes tank games!Have fun!
A11CPRM6TWQVEK B0054JZC6E 2 1326412800 36 this game looks good but I agree with every one this game great idea's. but bad games there J's a couple I like but you have to get a million points to get a couple games
A11CPRM6TWQVEK B008GUNBOI 1 1359763200 49 dumbest thing ever. adds pop up out of nowhere you can only make two kinds of shakes. you click 2 times and its over the graphics sucked I cant make my shake with out flippen adds do not get thisthis games is worth as much as a paper weight
A11CTIJ7EL20AQ B008M2WGRI 1 1343779200 46 this stupid game I bought wouldn't download and it keeps saying please try again. wtf!?!? come on trinities interactive studios! make a game that actually down loads! if u r reading this do not buy it or else it will take ur money and wont download.
A11CTIJ7EL20AQ B0086700CM 5 1338076800 24 this game is the best. I have been waiting for forever. I played this on the I pod touch and it was so addicting.
A11CTXIHXHFKRT B007SYWFRM 5 1339804800 20 Very fun and entertaining game. I like the fact that there is no energy to burn. You can play continuously.
A11CTXIHXHFKRT B004XJKUJ0 5 1335744000 23 this is a powerful message every day I read it.people need to read the lords words everyday and live this way.Its so peacful
A11CTXIHXHFKRT B005YIPHL0 5 1350432000 23 what a way to start your day.this is a great app!!!a blessing a day is always the way to start a great morning
A11CW1GHKVD425 B007TBAQCK 5 1336435200 26 This is a lot of fun. I can also link it to facebook. I haven't had any problems with the game so it was worth downloading.
A11CW1GHKVD425 B00HCMG6LG 3 1389571200 21 The game is fun. Wish it could have more than 8 levels. I would rate higher when more levels are added.
A11CW1GHKVD425 B0081JPTXK 3 1346371200 25 I love this game on facebook I wish we could play the same games and that we could get our gift spins from our friends.
A11CW1GHKVD425 B00DJFIMW6 1 1386892800 37 Would rate the game a 5 but it no longer opens. I have the game on both my Kindle fire and Samsung galaxy and neither will work. I have uninstalled and installed but still nothing. This sucks.
A11CW1GHKVD425 B007PT3QOQ 5 1341100800 21 I have just started playing the game this morning and so far so good. I am having a lot of fun.
A11CW1GHKVD425 B004FOA84A 3 1304035200 25 i was able to play right after i installed but now it keeps force closing. I would give five stars if it didn't force close
A11CWMUJIDFWTU B006JNH7YY 3 1325980800 34 the game is okay but a bit frustrating because the puzzles don't quite work right. graphics are pretty good and the plot is better than I expected it to be.the characters are shallow though...
A11CWMUJIDFWTU B0067Q4RCI 4 1325808000 24 if you like testing your powers of observation, then this addicting game should be right up your alley! get your reading glasses out though!
A11CWMUJIDFWTU B00E8KLWB4 4 1405468800 24 Good graphics and I like the numerous levels.Great game, I just wish it didn't cost so much to play. Other than that, super addicting.
A11CX6T8ABMSWG B00I3D27CU 5 1392768000 24 Very entertaining and fascinating game to play. Love all the little nuances to the game. IWould recommend to anyone who loves hidden object games.
A11CX6T8ABMSWG B006U0Y07I 5 1392768000 32 AWESOME game with so many twists and turns that kept me entertained during the entire hidden object search. I JUST LOVED IT!!! Definitely will recommend to anyone who loves hidden object games!
A11CX6T8ABMSWG B007RHJWT4 5 1348790400 23 This is one of those games that adults & kids alike can enjoy playing. It is good for keeping the brain active also.
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B007BPYCAG 5 1333152000 75 Honestly me and my best friend sealena, highly recommend this little distraction. When I'm not at home or away from my kindle,I cant help but think of this app.But the other guy before me is right. I let my friend Rupert use this and he made two of them having as I call it &quot;Sitck Sex&quot; so. And also the guy before him was right too. Please add Some blood and more weapons thanx.Carly Gomez
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B00876UUN6 5 1340496000 34 I loove this app. but 1 thing keeps tugging at my nerves. The so quote &quot;Bouffant&quot; is just like a phanpy&trade;&hellip;. The rest are all original. But phanpy&hellip; I mean Bouffant is pretty bothersome.....
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B0074W01II 5 1359590400 47 This game is amazing! Whenever my friends and I get bored we make some avatars on this app and then we get right back into the fun spirit! L-O-V-E Love this game! Get it now! I would gladly buy the full version if I could afford it!
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B007Q3KX42 5 1338854400 90 The cute fluffy cats are amazing. And the stout puppies are to die for. Too freakin' cute. It does however have the small flaw of force close and crashing. But aside from that this is the best app ever. Oh and a little recommendation. Please let us adopt a pet in the beginning name it and take care of it through out the game. Give us a selection of every breed. And for cross-breeds we must pay a small fee of the dollars. Please consider. Signed~Carley Minaj. Kindle Fire User.
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B004UID2LC 4 1350345600 51 Mine did the same. All you need to do to fix is uninstall and re-install immediately. That will fix it. And now for the response. Youtube downloading. Two things I used to never be able to put in the same sentence. now. I finally can. thank you. -Kitty Johnson KF user
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B006N1K1AE 5 1332633600 30 This is the best drawing app ive downloaded yet. A baby I babysit laughed when I made my butterfly. because it looked like a blob of pink. Anyways, great app.
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B00A8ECU24 5 1356998400 128 Simple gameplay and very involving. Being a Pegi myself I would highly recommend this app for everyone young and old. It has absolutely no issues on my Kindle Fire so far. When friends come over we play this and laugh every so often but we have fun with it. The graphics rock and the 3D ponies make sounds if from the mane six or if Mrs. (Cup)cake. Although a suggestion to the game makers is to make Derpy a buyable pony. Sure she's there every now and then and you get coins (bits) for finding her but if the reason she ain't there is the &quot;offense&quot;. Just make her name something like Ditzy or Hooves. But please add her to the character list. Thanks for reading!~The Ouran Otaku
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B006OCM0G0 5 1333065600 83 So everyone's complaining that you &quot;shouldn't get this for a child&quot;. That's not always true. My 2 yr old cousin loves this game and she comes to ASK MY PERMISSION before she hits ok. It's Not TeamLava's fault, maybe your kid's just irresponsible and care free. Anyway, this game is awesome. You get to name your restaurant and give it a personal design. I mean, sure, maybe it is a little hard to earn coins but, deal with it, it's worth it.~Utada Yuki
A11CXCR6X9KU19 B008OOYALE 5 1360195200 68 This game is an improvement from their last ones. This game does NOT make you buy stuff to prosper. Every 5 minutes there's no pop-up saying &quot;Oops! You need more gems to buy this, would you like to go to the store now?&quot;. Instead of buying all the stuff, you can just cross-breed your original, coin-payed, dragons. BTW, lookin' for neighbors, add me @ Rainbow_Dash_2_U. Thanks everyone!~Utada Yuki
A11D0K2LV272MI B007SYWFRM 5 1334620800 21 needs more animals to buy with money not acorns you have to actually pay for and needs to have more attractions.
A11D0K2LV272MI B009HKL4B8 5 1349740800 20 great game on kindle make Sims look like real people and have fun living in a Sim world great graphics
A11D0K2LV272MI B00CKW6FVE 5 1369872000 21 This game is addictive and fun I have been plying nonstop great like Tetris but with a twist it's really fun.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B0085VR7WU 5 1368921600 38 for those who have played farkle on facebook know how addicting this game is. those who haven't, plan on spending hours on here without realizing it. proceed with caution lol. you have been warned lol. seriously it's fun!
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B009YOX9C4 4 1358035200 41 I'd give it 5 stars, but I've found that you have to redownload the books you have in cloud after having read them and removing from device. Just because it's not on my device doesn't mean I don't want it organized.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00BG3ID0Y 4 1365552000 35 keeps your mind going. trying to figure out what the connection is between the four pictures. loving the fact that you get coins daily and it helps for the times you get in a bind.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B009UWL580 5 1359763200 21 fantastic app for killing time. easy to figure out. somewhat challenging and frustrating cuz the claw does drop items and whatnot.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00E5GJ7QS 4 1381536000 28 if you like bingo, then this is a perfect game for you. I haven't seen too many bingo games out there that is just a regular bingo game.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00E8KLWB4 3 1401580800 20 It doesn't help that you have to rate this app during the game to get the goals to clear out.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B008GTV9DO 1 1358812800 49 what crap! I had downloaded the app, then I go to play it and it needed 74 Mb additional data. so I download that and go to play, now it needs an additional Mb of data or storage space or whatever. didn't care where or what it needed. uninstalled!
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B006IXO1G2 5 1368835200 53 Ancestry app itself is free. You can search for information for free, just not unlimited without a fee. No different than ancestry.com. Thing is, as of this date, the app doesn't allow you to check your messages. You have to go to ancestry.com for that. Hopefully, it'll get updated to where you can.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00529IOXO 1 1359331200 29 I got it, then read the reviews. so I decided to read the terms of use. didn't like what I was supposed to agree to, so I uninstalled it.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00BWBHIUG 4 1369094400 39 it's fun. recommended for kids who can follow directions. not sure if it reads to you since I almost always play while my daughter's sleeping. I haven't let her play cuz I don't think this was made for toddlers.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00AREIAI8 4 1359244800 20 this app is great for horse lovers. it's great for kids too. it's easy, fun, and intriguing. I like it.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00AF0IKRK 1 1359417600 21 I couldn't use it. no locations in Iowa. so if you're in Iowa,  this app is useless. don't waste your space.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00BGC5UAG 2 1363651200 34 I got to the hawk, dog, man covering eyes, and broken window level and got stuck. not worth the $.99 to go pro. no more hints unless you go pro after 3 used hints.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B00ERXVOII 3 1380758400 23 gotta figure out how to jump just right and beat the timer on some of them. make sure you get your stars too.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B008XG1X18 5 1362441600 20 before I got this app I didn't use pintrest often. now I use it a lot. wonderful app to have.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B009HHX414 3 1359504000 103 so far I'm liking this. got my contacts from my dejaoffice app and no one has gotten spammed. I even read the terms of use, and liked what I saw.2/28/13I'm digging the updates on this. I get notifications on my kindle and a pop-up text box, to which I can reply instantly or close if I have no response or view the conversation. Just the improvement this app needed.6/14/13Took two stars off as the update seems to make it force close. I can no longer search this product on amazon either. So as of now, I am uninstalling what was a great product.
A11D0TGBF5PO89 B0094BB4TW 2 1380758400 33 at first, it was fine. now I'm having lots of issues with m.facebook.com so now what? I have to go to desktop view, if I can even get there. it hangs a lot.
A11D2LP9YVYCZ2 B004SJ3BCI 5 1360022400 33 I finally decided to try the very popular angry birds. Both my 3yr old and I enjoy playing together and alone. You can turn off the in app purchases!!!! Thank you angry birds
A11D2LP9YVYCZ2 B007A2IOOU 4 1343088000 42 cool hidden object game with good mini game but it lasted like 4to 5 minutes. usually I am not the type that complains about things I get for free but it seriosly took 15 min to download and 5 minutes to play.
A11D2LP9YVYCZ2 B006JPS1OM 4 1343088000 53 I would describe this game as a murder mystery,hidden object adventure and I absolutely love it. I have played lots of this type game and It's definatly in the top 5. Try the free version, play an entire chapter and decide for yourself. I mean it's free what have you got to lose.
A11D6W0UZ4PM1M B00ANUMR1W 5 1362614400 21 love game but when I went to get free coin.didn't get. played juracic park builder but did not get 13 coins
A11D6W0UZ4PM1M B0086700CM 5 1355184000 45 I HAVE NOT STOP PLAYING THIS SINCE I BOUGHT IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE. I BOUGHY IT ON THE. 2ND OF DEC I HAVE ALREADY PLAYED ALMOST. 5000 GAMES. AND. COMPLETED 23 OF THE 57 LEVELS FOR THE FIRST CHARACTER. LOOKING FORWARD TO. TO NEXT CHARACTER.
A11D6W0UZ4PM1M B00DX65ORM 4 1382400000 20 Great  fame lot of interest. More s surrendered to get jackpot in treasure collection s 15 do  n to 2'
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B0093QQAEM 5 1402963200 35 This is an app for watching the movies, cartoons, and solo much more from the &quot;good ole` days&quot;! LOL! This is an app that is easy to use and is one for us &quot;older kids&quot;!!!!!!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B0057PAY8G 1 1400457600 232 I USED TO LOVE THE POCKET APP. I HAVE HAD IT FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS OR SO.  I AM IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION AND I USED THIS APP TO KEEP MEDICAL JOURNAL ARTICLES, TESTING FOR YEARLY CEUs (CONTINUING EDUCATION CREDITS), ETC., FROM MEDICAL JOURNALS, ARTICLES, RESEARCH BEING DONE......YOU GET THE IDEA.THE POINT IS THAT I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO DO THESE THINGS ON THE INTERNET WHILE ON THE GO WITH NO WI-FI ACCESS AND NO 3G, SO I WOULD PUT THEM IN THE POCKET SO IF I HAD A FEW MINUTES HEAR AND THERE, I COULD READ THEM. IT WAS PERFECT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A 5 STAR RATING. BUT THAT WAS BEFORE THE LAST UPDATE OF THE APP.IN THIS LAST UPDATE, I WOULD LIKE THE DEVELOPERS TO LET THOSE OF US WHO HAVE IT EXACTLY WHY THEY NEED ACCESS TO OUR CONTACTS` INFORMATION????? THAT IS JUST LUDICROUS!!!!!!!WHY? THERE IS NO REASON I CAN THINK OF UNLESS THEY ARE UP TO NO GOOD. I WOULD HATE TO THINK THIS, BECAUSE I HAVE ENJOYED THIS APP FOR SO LONG. THAT'S WHY I WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO TELL US WHY.IN MY OPINION, THEY JUST RUINED IT FOR ME. THAT'S WHY I RATE IT A 1 STAR NOW. I AM NO LONGER USING THE APP. DOES ANYONE KNOW OF ANY OTHERS THAT DO A GOOD JOB WITHOUT THE INVASIVENESS??????
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B006QCMPWM 4 1330732800 30 Cool, relaxing game! It's fun to take care of your "fish babies"! It is like having your own "real" fish tank without all the hassles and upkeep of having it!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B00E0NVX4U 4 1380412800 372 A twist on a hidden object game that is REALLY cool. The way it is laid out, that you are building your own antique shop, while earning money by helping other &quot;keepers of stuff&quot; (one man's junk is another man's treasure).You go where you are called to help, say, to help gather someone's vinyl record collection up. Well, after you do so completely, you are paid for the job, and you can use this money to build your own antique shop.There are various places you go, and different things you do at each place.The reasons I gave this game a 4 star is because even though you are going different places and doing different things, the things you do, cycle themselves all through the game. So, really, you are doing the same games, but say like, 4 -6 same games recycled throughout the game at different intervals, using different situations. I hope this makes sense to everyone. The other downfall of this game is that you download it for free, play a few rounds, and guess what? Yep, you guessed it! Time to &quot;unlock the full game from within the game&quot;. This just means that if you want to continue playing the game, you have to cough up some money a.k.a. coins. This one is not bad, and is worth the price of $1.99, which is what I paid at the time of this review, to unlock the &quot;full&quot; game. It is a worthwhile game for the price. I also enjoy Big Fish Games.What I am tired of, and I am sure a lot of other people like me out there are too, is why disguise the true pricing of an app/game???? I hate these so called &quot;free&quot; apps, that aren't free at all and some are just out to get your personal info. I feel the same way about in-app purchasing. I would rather KNOW the WHOLE price of an app, purchase it once, and be done with it!!This app could have put the real price upfront, and I would have still bought it.I wish Amazon would quit allowing these practices to continue, though. It would be an AWESOME CHANGE, and I know a lot of you would agree with me!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B0074AKEDC 5 1371254400 317 This hidden object game is not just any old, same old, hidden object game! Why you may ask?? Well, this is what makes this game stand out way above the rest!! First of all, there is a storyline in what I would call this quest to......well, you will find that out at the beginning of the game, when the plane you are flying crashes and you are found on an island by a native. The circumstances around your crash begin to become very mysterious and strange as you get into the game a little bit.Without spoiling the game totally, let's just say that you find bits of each object you have to find until you have ALL OF THE PIECES TO EACH OBJECT. Then, there are things you have to do in order to find some of your pieces, such as fixing a leaky faucet; but first, you must find what you need to fix it. Absolutely just a very interesting, wee bit challenging, can't put it away, AWESOME game!!!!!!!!There is just sooooo much to this game, that I could never begin to say; plus, I wouldn't want to, because you need to experience it for yourself! I DON'T think you will be disappointed AT the LEAST!!!It is a rarity these days to find such a wonderful game with wonderful graphics, with so much to do, with twists along the way, with a fun storyline, with just a little actual &quot;thinking&quot; required at times (without it being too much that it becomes frustrating-not even close), and ALL for just $0.99!!!!!!!I have bought games for that price that NO WAY, NO HOW, CAME EVEN CLOSE TO THE CALIBER THAT THIS ONE HAS! THIS GAME IS IN A LEAGUE OF IT'S OWN AND I LOVE IT!!!!Salwar Entertainment Inc., PLEASE MAKE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS ONE!  IT IS AN AWESOME GAME FOR AN AWESOME PRICE!!!!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!!!!!!!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B006HXUZJU 5 1399680000 58 I love to play Mahjong and have played it for years in many different styles, but none like this. This is so cute with all of the different animals! It is a pleasure to play.I have also never had any problems with playing the game. It works exactly as promised. For just 99&cent;, this game is a steal!!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B00B29PJGS 4 1373587200 169 I have always loved word search puzzles since I was a little kid, so it takes a really good &quot;word hunting&quot; app to impress me.This one does just that. There are many categories of words to choose from; much more than ANY other $0.99 app would! Not only that, each category has an easy, normal, and hard mode, which really means you get 3 times the amount of word searches in this app.No matter your level of play, there is a word hunt for you with this app. It makes it great for kids too because they can work on their vocabulary as they go through the different hunts, no matter their skill set.It's good for adults too because it helps to keep our minds exercising, which studies have shown to decrease Alzheimer's disease. &quot;Use it or lose it&quot;, I believe the old saying goes. Goodness knows, I need all the help I can get! LOL!But seriously, this is a fun app and everyone should give it a try!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B0055SWM08 5 1344643200 38 The music is very relaxing and so is the game. But don't let that fool you! It is very intriguing and you have to use your wits to play; but it's a zen journey, not a stressful one!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B00FIW5BZE 4 1404086400 58 I love Mahjong! I have been playing Mahjong for years and this is one of the better ones out there as far as having many selections, such as types of tiles and backgrounds.It also runs smoothly, which is a plus. The only thing I would like to see is the ability to choose your own layouts to play.
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B007V5CF5K 4 1372377600 413 This review is more about the changes I have seen with the apps that Alawar Entertainment Inc. have now been putting out. The first app I bought of theirs was The Mystery of Treasure Island, and it was awesome!!! This app was also awesome (why the rating is a 4), and it was a great app for a great price. Both apps have stunning graphics, intriguing things to do, and well, just plain addictive to play.But over the last week or so, I have noticed the new apps they have come up with, and it broke my heart. I couldn't wait for more apps by Alawar after the ones I had purchased and played, but it seems like they have changed in a way like so many others. Most of their new apps cost more,  but not unreasonably so. But here is the kicker: almost ALL of their new apps not only have to be purchased, but THEY HAVE IN-APP PURCHASING AS WELL!!!!!!! Are you KIDDING ME?????????After purchasing the app, they want EVEN MORE MONEY WITH IN-APP PURCHASING!!!!!!! I think this is the one thing that will stop me, as well as many others, from buying an app. In apps like these, you can choose not to purchase anything, but then you either miss out on the &quot;cool stuff&quot; to have in the game, hints/help in the game, unlocking more of the game, etc.Whatever happened to purchasing a game ONCE and the game being all there and being able to earn things/unlock things in the game by just simply playing it?????I thought that Alawar was going to be this kind of company after I had gotten these first apps and I was like &quot;FINALLY!!!&quot; Now, I am so disappointed.Alawar Entertainment Inc., PLEASE DON'T CHANGE FROM YOUR ORIGINAL STYLE!!!!!!!! On the first of your apps, there are MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO LOVED YOUR APPS (just check the number of people who wrote GOOD reviews)!!On your newer apps, I know they haven't been out too long, but it seems like there isn't the same response as on your older ones. I believe a lot of people feel like I do, and don't like the added in-app purchasing.I mean, why mess up your AWESOME apps with something that is going to deter people from buying them??????? You can make more money in the long run by selling more of the apps themselves than by in-app purchasing that turns people to other apps that don't have it.
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B00EEDJHXA 5 1401667200 329 I really enjoy this game. It can keep me interested for hours; NO joke. I don't normally like the logic games such as the ones where you have to figure out how to get out of rooms, buildings, etc.But this game is completely different. Yes, you use logic, reasoning, etc. to figure out which way to cut the buttons off, but it is really fun.The basic play of the game is you have a piece of fabric ( used as different sized grids, basically ), that you cut different colored buttons off of. You have to cut two or more of the same colored buttons either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally until the grid ( fabric, cloth ) is clear. But it's not that easy! What fun would be??You start out with a 5X5 grid and it gradually gets harder as you go. The buttons are all mixed up on the grid and you have to remember that you have to have two or more buttons in order to cut them off. And if there is a different colored button in your way.........well, you have to figure something else out.If you totally bomb one, don't worry because you can restart the whole grid you are working on and try again as many times as you like. You can also reverse moves that you just did.It is a very fun game with simple instructions. It is a easy game, but not too easy that you are bored. There are also tons and tons of levels!!! It has long time play appeal, that's for sure. It also saves your progress for you automatically and at anytime you can reset the whole game and start all over.......NOW THAT IS LONG TIME PLAY APPEAL!!!! LOL!!!!All in all, it's a great game that is very fun to play.......well, I would say addicting!! It runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;. It also exits cleanly, is definitely worth the price, and is definitely a KEEPER!!!!!!
A11D9GDGSNDTPI B0095MVOMC 4 1369612800 153 I absolutely love hide and seek type games, and when I saw that this one was with hidden numbers, I JUST HAD to try it!!! The layout is beautiful; scenery is spectacular.Finding the hidden numbers was pretty easy, but some were a little tricky to find because they blended in so well. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating, was because I felt that most of the numbers were too easy to find, and also there weren't as many levels as I would have liked to have seen. Of course, it just might have been that I loved playing it so much that it seemed shorter! LOL!As for the price of this app, I would say it's pretty fair, but for the $1.99, more levels need to be added or maybe the price lowered to maybe $1.49??All in all, this is a very fun, entertaining, addicting, game. Try it!!!!!
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B007T8Z5PG 5 1349568000 202 I bought this for my 1st gen Kindle Fire.  The graphics were great and the game was very cool with awesome sound effects and intricate detail. A very large game though with a lot to offer; however it did bog my Kindle down when not in the game.  The game itself moved well while playing it, but when I exited I would have blank panels at times where books or apps used to be. They would still work, you just couldn't see their graphic on the carrousel. When I rebooted it would correct itself, but as soon as I reentered the game the panels would sporadically disappear again.  I had planned to finish the game and uninstall it to return the Kindle to proper working order again, but I decided to upgrade to the Kindle Fire HD.  This game does not work yet on the HD models.  The fact that the 1st Gen Kindle Fire couldn't completely handle the mass of this game is in no way MumboJumbo's fault so that is why I still gave it a 5 star rating.  If you like hunt and seek puzzle games where you move around the landscape to solve then you'll love this one!
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B008Y7SMQU 3 1351468800 59 A different kind of game.  All you do is identify the logo hints for points. Of course the points don't mean anything as you're playing yourself. But still you get a sense of accomplishment and you do earn hints which you can use to identify the logos you don't know. Good fun and time killer for a free game.
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B0094BB4TW 2 1383523200 21 This version is fairly difficult to navigate thru and a bit confusing. The PC web site version works SO much easier!
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B00BUONELM 5 1366329600 205 My 12 year old daughter and I each downloaded this game to our respective Kindle Fire HD's and it works great. Initially last October this particular game wasn't converted to run on the HD and would drag the limited 1st gen Fire down, but now it operates great.  The graphics and puzzles are awesome.  You get to solve mysteries and progress to an actual goal for completion.  There are mini games to complete as you travel thru the game solving each goal too.  Ghosts will talk to you and block your path till you can find and give them what they seek.  There are object search games to compete at times to locate other objects that will allow you to progress.  My daughter worked it tirelessly over spring break and completed the main game and is now working the locked games that come with the Collector's Edition.  This is my second MumboJumbo game and these guys are the best at this type of thing.  If you like solving puzzles, but get bored with repetition, then this is just the game for you and your family.  At .99 cents this is a HUGE bargain.  Buy it now before these guys wise up and raise the price!!
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B0064QNS62 1 1366329600 40 I downloaded it because it was the free app of the day.  Thought it would be a bit Mario Brotheresque but i was wrong.  After 10 minutes I removed it from my Kindle.  Graphics seemed basic and the premise boring.
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B00B29PJGS 3 1382313600 97 I used to love word hunt puzzles as a kid so I thought this would be a cool game.  It is the best it can be with a game of this type.  I guess I grew out of this type of entertainment, but if you like word hunt puzzles you will like this app, it's nicely done and allows for easy mode to difficult mode timing to complete and records them for you so you can go back and try and better yourself.  Lots of different ones to complete so there are hours of puzzles to do.
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B00CT9ZVGI 3 1384905600 169 The game was interesting and kept me engaged enough to return and try and complete it.  However, its not as slick in graphics as some of the other games of this type and this free version was a teaser for the purchase points that will allow you to continue on with it.  Also, I found that for some reason this particular game ran in the background and drew battery life even when I closed it before putting my Kindle Fire to sleep.  I would have 36% battery life when I exited the game and when I returned several hours later my Kindle would be out of juice.  I suspected this game and when I deleted it the problem of power drain stopped too.  Maybe, I'm wrong all I can do is relate my experience. If you like search and discover games that have you solve problems and apply found items to advance thru a tale then you'll enjoy this game.  Try it for yourself and make your own discovery.
A11D9WMYB2BRKU B004HXHVZ8 5 1386201600 42 A must have it you go to the movie theaters.at all.  I travel and use this app where ever I am.  Will show you all the theaters near you and give you movies and times as well as address of the theater.
A11DB2G5WB1LIG B004SUWR2C 5 1331510400 34 this app is just like the card game. I love it. you can get it for your I pad or I pod too. I am reviewing the kindle fire version. it gets 5 stars!
A11DB2G5WB1LIG B006D1ONE4 5 1331510400 20 loveeeeeeeee ittttttttttttt so much because I can play it on a website also called Disney.com.  wahooo is what it is.
A11DD4UU2XHFSA B008IXP8IU 4 1353974400 34 For me this game started out easy.  The further along I get it is harder.  It is really good if you like a challenge and want to increase your vocabulary or challenge your memory.
A11DE3OC83S847 B009EEFTMC 5 1360886400 35 I enjoy Mahjong, but have never found a good one on Android.  Mostly because they don't fit on the screen.This is a tile matching game with a unique display.It's smooth,  and it's fun.Very well done.
A11DE3OC83S847 B0067R8JNK 4 1323129600 42 would be 5 stars, but the dev is not responsive. This is always a raging debate, but the dictionary needs work .. ID is not a word, but DNA is.  There are other odd words, but ultimately, it's a VERY good game.
A11DE3OC83S847 B0052OSTOS 2 1387152000 75 I am trying to get into mediation.  Just listening to music wasn't doing anything for me.I thought guided meditation might be better. It wasn't. It was a slightly different experience, but still not what I'm expecting.It may be the app, and it may be me, but there was one review that said, &#34;Just shut up&#34;. I have to agree. She talks incessantly.I'm sure it's a personal preference thing, but as I said, &#34;not for me&#34;.
A11DE3OC83S847 B004X80QNG 1 1323216000 60 Sub tasks are not indented.  No widget.  The calendar views are pretty enough, but even for free it's a waste if space.I use "Google Task Organizer" and "Calendar Pad".  They have free versions, but even if you buy both, that's $6 instead of $10, and they are useful.  I was HIGHLY disappointed.  I got it free, and still installed it.
A11DIE6VJ6P8E3 B008IJTFYW 5 1374969600 23 Helps drown out noise and even had sound waves designed to help you fall asleep but head phones are needed for  that feature.
A11DJSJRUVICKL B004SUWR2C 2 1334275200 26 it iznt good because u have to have a download thing first and i dont know how to do it. it just shouldnt have the download.
A11DJSJRUVICKL B0071PARPA 4 1340841600 25 its good. everyone who is an artist would like this. people who don't like this game....if you dont have anything nice to say...don't say it
A11DJSJRUVICKL B007MTKYQC 1 1334707200 103 every time the biker died....i started to cry my eyes out. it was so emotional for me to see some guys head getting ripped off his body. i tried to keep him alive as best as i could. i removed this app from my system because my husband started to get worried about my feelings for this poor young man. each and every time he man died the guilt came more and more at me. my kids were also starting to get concerned about this app also. they started to get worried about me.this is the most sad app i ever had );
A11DJSJRUVICKL B0052UZIFA 5 1334707200 110 OMG!!! this is the funnest (made up word) game ever. all of the peeps who thinks this is a fail...UR A FAILURE.this is one of my favorite apps and im sure kids and all ages would love this app. i couldnt put it down. i always used to watch my  big brother and sister play it on their i pods and i got so bored. but i finally got the app (the first one i got) and i finally realized why they were screaming : NO NO PUT A PLANT THERE FAST!!!!!!  and i wuz amazed.

A11DKNOMDHPPNY B00JTKDTLE 5 1399939200 29 I like this one.  Once you realize the song and candence it even sounds ok. I have only just begun what looks to be a great one finger tangle.
A11DKNOMDHPPNY B0064X7B4A 5 1368662400 21 I enjoy the different new cloud friends I play with a lot the game is  as difficult as the randomness creates
A11DKNOMDHPPNY B00BEPVAV8 5 1387411200 20 great your driving can be fun and no matter how much stuff you hit your insurance doesn't go up :)
A11DKNOMDHPPNY B00AEJPK0C 5 1368316800 21 What looks like a quick no brainer just keeps getting  faster and more difficult and this requires great thought faster fingers.

A11DQ5DOJX5IN B00E8KLWB4 5 1392681600 21 If you like hidden object games, then you will like this game. You can play this game without spending your money.
A11DQ5DOJX5IN B00CPPXYC4 5 1383523200 20 I love this game I just wish it was easier to get swords. Other than that, it is very enjoyable.
A11DQ5DOJX5IN B00A37XD90 5 1382227200 22 This is a fun app. I love this game. I wish it was easier to get the items needed to move forward.
A11DSRHIJLOGXZ B00GIZO674 5 1397952000 25 I don't rate many games but this one is a whole lot of fun. I was surprised by how quickly I became addicted to it.
A11DSRHIJLOGXZ B00DYY92MG 4 1379203200 26 This is a fun and challenging game that will keep you busy for hours. It's great for people who have a great knowledge of tv shows.
A11DSRHIJLOGXZ B009HKL4B8 5 1381536000 35 This is the first time I have ever played Sims and I just started about an hour ago but I love this game. It is so fun and has great graphics. Totally worth the download.
A11DX2KORUUP2R B008XG1X18 5 1395964800 24 Accepting a personal challenge to kick the computer games, I am now addicted to Pinterest.... it allows me to live my ideal life :-)
A11DX2KORUUP2R B005ZFOOE8 4 1392595200 20 Good music and easy to navigate, more so than others, and less frustrating to get what you want to hear.
A11DX2KORUUP2R B00D74E5MA 4 1391472000 58 love the great ideas and inspiration on this site but do not appreciate the security.... suppose I'm being simplistic and not respecting the intellectual property of those whose work is posted, but that's just me.  Lots of things that I would love to make mine given the time, talent and dollars to accomplish.  Great launch pad for projects.
A11DX2KORUUP2R B00F3W1GAS 4 1387324800 24 I luv these hidden puzzles.  Think they are great for keeping your brain and reflexes going.  Keep them comingWish the screens were better lit
A11DX2KORUUP2R B00AEJPK0C 5 1368144000 51 Just can't quit on this one, I must go til I've completed every possible level.  I a l ways keep the volume OFF while playing games so can't comment there and it doesn't seem to offer much customization option but I have enjoyed playing this week in the CASUAL mode.  Nice.
A11DYEATG6S3LO B004SBX112 2 1351123200 26 Why is it that paid users of this game have to wait for updates? By the time I get the update the level is old news!
A11DYEATG6S3LO B007MNV5WU 3 1343260800 39 the game is hours of fun but I hate how the updates for kindle fire is so damn slow and have to wait so long all the time for updates on all angry birds games for the kindle fire
A11E26OD1D1A3P B00E1LILWI 3 1391558400 23 Animal Planet is a great channel. But it is very limited on 'free' episodes, Alot of 'clips' to view. Just love Turtle Man
A11E26OD1D1A3P B00808GTI6 5 1391558400 24 this app is great and actually has full episodes to view for free. Thanks for letting me get caught up on Hell On wheels.
A11E26OD1D1A3P B00CO52NLI 3 1377648000 23 It is a good virtual reality game for younger children. I see where it would teach them time management.thanks for the free app
A11E26OD1D1A3P B00E1JZIGW 2 1391558400 30 This app really only allows you to view if you subscribe to a tv provider. Now that I have free TV, with an antenna, this app doesn't allow any viewing.
A11E8CMT6R1TNH B00A3WTXQ2 4 1358294400 30 I like this game but Wat's the point there's no ending is the point to get enough coins to buy things. but I still love the game buy happy fall
A11E8CMT6R1TNH B008PPGFZG 3 1353888000 34 its ok but you have to already need a instagram and the kindle has a camera but you still cant post pics or get them off the Internet and also look @ the price.
A11E8CMT6R1TNH B0058VCGXU 1 1351555200 23 it is reallllllllllly bad. I tried it on my friend and it didn't work and yes the kindle fire dose have a camera.
A11E8CMT6R1TNH B00992CF6W 4 1394928000 38 this was a great game and really fun I couldn't stop playing in but in my survival world I would find diamonds and then it would get deleted but other then that I would recomemd it worth it
A11EAVE2411WN5 B00B2V66VS 5 1390348800 42 Love this game!  Much better than the original Temple Run, this one can get you in a trance where you'll play for 10-15 minutes in one run without failing and you won't even realize the time has gone by!  Super fun game!
A11EAVE2411WN5 B004QOP62S 4 1353888000 29 If you like Boggle or other similar word games, you'll love WordWrench!  Simple interface and easy, intuitive actions make this game very easy to play from the very start.
A11EAVE2411WN5 B007ET5P4Q 2 1353888000 56 In keeping with the Walking Dead franchise, this application (&#34;game&#34;) does what it's supposed to do.  You play as Shane Walsh and try to avoid being turned into a zombie.  It's kind of a short-lived game, and can get pretty graphic.  Overall it's not something that I was terribly impressed with, and uninstalled shortly after installing.
A11EAVE2411WN5 B0058UO9AE 5 1353888000 26 This is a great &#34;Dots&#34; game!  Hours of enjoyment can be had by playing this game!  Brings a nice modern touch to a timeless classic game!
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B0078GZ1HG 4 1336003200 97 Grabbed this as the free app of the day, and don't regret it. It's a simple side scroller mixed with snowboarding. Decent graphics, mediocre sounds, but it runs super smooth. It's not a Cut the Rope, Angry Birds, or Plants VS Zombies addictive kind of game, but it's not one to pass on either. I would buy this had I not gotten it free today. Overall, a pretty good time wasting game that I can and will play for a while. This is not one of those games that you install for 3 minutes and uninstall it.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B006RAX9OQ 2 1325203200 117 Honestly, I didn't have high expectations when I downloaded this game even though people were giving 4-5 stars. Graphics and sounds are OK and it does run smoothly. Three negatives though right away. It runs feint, there's no way to exit/quit, and the screen times out and locks if I don't tap the screen once in a while. Aside from that, the gameplay isn't thrilling or even interesting. I have no desire to keep playing to unlock more ships or levels. It has already been uninstalled. Can I make a better game? Of course not. But if I was going to buy this one, I'd think twice. I would have been mad if it wasn't free today.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B0052UZIFA 5 1306886400 49 Great graphics, awesome sounds, funny, challenging, and all around fun.I got this when it was the free app of the day on Amazon, but I would gladly pay for it. For $3, if you like &quot;Tower Defense&quot; style games, this is a gem.Runs perfect on my Evo running gingerbread.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004Z9ZNTK 2 1319932800 132 I grabbed this while it was the free app of the day. Installed fine on my EVO 3D. On the first start, it froze on the loading screen. Killed it and restarted, ran just fine. Honestly, I'm not impressed. I wasn't into the graphics, music, smoothness, story line, gameplay, or anything about it. The swiping is so unresponsive that I found it better to fast tap the screen repeatedly. Even then, it wasn't very playable. I imagine that it's probably a kids game, so if you're okay with spending $2 on this so your child can play with your handheld or tablet, go for it. I've already uninstalled it and will not download it again even after future updates. I just don't find value in this or see anything interesting about it.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004T3K50E 3 1319328000 151 Ok, so honestly this could be a really good game. I happened to get it as the free app of the day, but I'll tell you now that it's worth a buck. One thing that is missing is some instructions. I started a new game, and right off the bat, I'm lost. I get the general idea because I've played similar games before. You run a town, build things, harvest resources, etc. But how? The menus and interfaces just aren't very good. I still haven't figured out how to assign jobs to people, and that's because the game hasn't explained the basics. It's telling me to, but again, how? The game would also benefit from a zoom in/out feature. Double tapping brings up a build menu and there's no pinch to zoom. I haven't given up on this yet, like I said it could be a good game. Just needs improvement.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004VFJMYK 1 1306627200 48 Installed the free app, then the pro. Both give FC shortly after starting. Seems like a great app and I'll look forward to using it someday. I saw an earlier post about it could be a problem on phones running gingerbread. I'm an htc evo user running 2.3.3.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B005OYF3BS 4 1319068800 175 This is a really good game. It's challenging, family friendly, the graphics are polished, it has decent music and sound, very smooth. In fairness though, there's not a whole lot of action going on so it should run smoothly on most handsets. It definitely does have a temperamental tapping system. You might accidentally tap the wrong web once in a while or it may not register your tap at all. If you could zoom in closer, it might help, but it's limited in gameplay. I've played for about half an hour now, and I'll be back for more. I can see why people complain about the ads. They are fairly large and will hinder your gaming experience. Small price to pay for an overall good free game. Rooted users will benefit from getting Ad-Free from the Market like I did. It's worth buying the full version though to support the developers. I rank this as good as Angry Birds, but not quite as fun as Plants vs Zombies or an &quot;elite&quot; game. EVO 3D user.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B005SJTLUS 3 1322524800 197 The Android Market gives this 4 1/2 stars, so all these one-star reviews are terrible. They don't represent a fair and realistic review. I get it though, the developer hasn't explained the permissions at all, but that's no reason to think he's trying to steal your private information. Get over it. Nobody wants to know what porn websites you visit or apps you run to steal your identity. If a developer wanted to be malicious, I doubt that they would publish on Amazon and/or the Android Market. Again though, devs should explain the reasons for permissions if they want to avoid the conspiracy theory people.Back to my review. I downloaded this without problems or issues on my EVO 3D. It runs fine. It's a typical side scrolling game with jump and attack buttons. The voice overs are funny, graphics are simple and sound effects were mediocre. It's okay.It's free today, but tomorrow I wouldn't pay $2 for it. If you enjoy this type of game, then you might find value in it. For instance, Wind Up Knight or that sort of game, here's another version. I just don't particularly find this style of game fun or interesting.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B00685VI98 2 1322179200 123 Grabbed this up while it was the free app of the day. The game installed fine, plays perfectly, no problems at all. However, I'm not going to keep this one. In fact, I've already uninstalled it after 15 minutes of playtime. It might have been free for me today, but had I paid for it, I'd be disappointed. It's too easy. The childlike graphics and music makes me feel like this is only for someone under the age of 12. Bottom line is, if you want an extremely simple time waster, you'll like it. If you have a kid who plays on your device, great. If you're looking for a game of skill or action, you'll probably want to pass on this one.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B005OC3AO2 4 1318118400 100 I'm sure that I'm not alone when I say, I'm tired of Angry Birds. This is a clever replacement. It's a little too cute for my taste, but it is fun. It looks as though it doesn't exactly fit the screen of my EVO 3D, but only off slightly. The sounds, gameplay, and graphics, like I mentioned, are a bit more childish than I'd like. But aside from simplicity it's a decent game. Seriously. It was free today, and I would say that this is worth a dollar any day. It never crashed, force closed, or froze up on me.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004O3YGMC 5 1325808000 125 I got this as the free app of the day, so I'm more than glad to review it. Honestly, I'd buy this for $5 and not think twice. Should be a no-brainer to buy if you're the type of person who is always on the go. The setup was very quick and easy. Just download the Splashtop Streamer program from the internet for your pc/mac and choose a password. The first time I tried to connect from my EVO 3D, it failed. But just trying again was all it took. I played around on my phone while my laptop was next to me. How cool to see it working perfectly. If you missed this today and wonder if it's worth buying, the answer is yes.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B007N5YIOO 3 1332374400 168 I grabbed this up on launch day. For a dollar, it's worth getting rid of the ads. Anyway, when the original Angry Birds was fresh and new, it was a hit. Like most people, I couldn't stop playing for very long before I went back to my device to play more. After a while, the novelty wore off. Every board is pretty much the same idea. Fling a bird, wreck the environment, take out the pigs. Now Angry Birds Space is a new twist on things. You've got gravity that comes into play. But again, fling a bird, wreck the environment, and take out the pigs. Definitely a good idea. But I think for me the novelty wore off long ago and I don't see myself playing this for very long. If you happen to be a die-hard Angry Birds fan, you'll probably love this. If you are more like me and pretty much bored with Angry Birds in general, think twice or just get the free version.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004GYVYV0 2 1326931200 159 I got this free today, so I figured that I would check it out. In my opinion, it's not worth $10. The layout is beautiful but that's just about all it has. The biggest feature that I would like is to have this sync with my accounts. It's not here. You literally have to enter any/every transaction manually. I think this app would be helpful if I had tons of different accounts and wanted to have everything available quickly in one place, but I don't. Even if I did, I can't see why I would want to manually enter every single transaction into my phone when online banking or viewing statements online is free everywhere. It's easier for me to use Pageonce for my needs. I don't see why anyone would prefer this over any of the free money apps out there. If this app actually synced with my bank accounts automatically, I'd have made a completely different review.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B005ZTFPFQ 4 1321315200 181 For those who remember the Atari 2600, the original one-button joystick that always broke, and those goofy paddles, this is for you. The app downloaded and installed fine on my EVO 3D. When first starting up, I was greeted by a really cool layout where each game is shown like you remember from the video arcades. Missile Command comes free, the rest you have to buy.For those who gave the 1 and 2 star reviews for only getting one game, shame on you. It clearly states it in the description. You didn't rate this app properly, you're showing how cheap you are. Users can buy 100 games for $10 or singles for a dollar. Trying this out first is smart. If Atari just sold an all inclusive $10 app, you'd whine about not being able to try it first to see if it works on your device.In closing, if you're the nostalgic type and want to relive those old school Atari memories, this is perfect. So far, I've only tried Missile Command and it was perfect. Exactly like I remember it.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B007Q3GY1S 5 1336176000 106 OG gamers will remember this as one of the first, if not THE first handheld game that you put in your hands. Simple graphics, simple sounds, not a 6 axis controller, no rumbling, no John Madden commentary. But it was football. This is such a great game for my phone. It's exactly as I remember it. It's funny, haven't played this game in many many years, but the little things that I did to &quot;fool&quot; the defense comes rushing back to memory. Honestly, I'd buy this if it weren't free already. Great for those that remember playing the real/original one. The young gamers just won't understand.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004WPG1A2 4 1321142400 137 I grabbed this while it was the free app of the day. It installed fine on my EVO 3D. This game isn't super flashy or polished. The simple music reminds me of a James Bond and a Spy vs Spy blend. No, this is not a Super Mario Brothers. But this game has a lot of elements that make it really enjoyable. It's clever. The touch controls for me were really easy to use. I actually want to keep playing this one. I've seen a lot of reviews that are one star for force close problems, so I'd like to add that I never got a fc while playing. To finish up, if you came across this game after its being offered for free and you're debating on buying, I will say that it's worth the money.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004SBS8LA 5 1302566400 27 Great updated version of the original Angry Birds on Android. I'll be looking forward to seeing more to come. Worth the 99 cents to be ad free.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004UBUK4Q 5 1304380800 45 This is not the kind of game I'd usually go for. But I took a chance and got this because I was interested in something different. Really, it's an addictive and interesting game. Hard in some ways, puzzling, strategic planning. I like it a lot.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004S80UUU 3 1305676800 64 Got this from the Android Market some time ago. From my experience, it's just not a good game, but not the worst either. Simple game in theory, but extremely frustrating to play. In my opinion, not worth the money to buy. Even if I would have gotten it as the free app of the day, I would have uninstalled within 10 minutes. Evo user.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B007KQ6XYY 5 1332633600 71 I got to original Cut the Rope as the free app of the day and loved it. When this popped up, I couldn't pass it up. This game rocks!It's buttery smooth and plays just like the original. If you liked the first one, you're going to love this one. New levels and new ways to feed candy to Om Nom. Don't hesitate. 99 cents? Pfft, well worth the pocket change.EVO 3D.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B007TLOYZU 3 1337212800 291 Honestly, I don't see why some people rate with 5 stars and other's 1. That's such an extreme difference. Me, I'm right in the middle. Here's why..It's a fairly large game to install, but it runs fine, and I'm pretty sure that I was able to move it to the micro sd. No big deal.The menus are well polished which gives me the impression that the graphics in game will be brilliant. No, not really. The sounds are really basic. They remind me of old school console games. No problems running or playing though, so that's a plus.Some people are giving one star reviews for Feint. I hate Feint as much as anyone, but I did not get asked to join it nor is it installed. So I wonder if those people actually installed the game to begin with.Then I see people rating one star because of in-game purchases. Again, if I buy a game, I don't want to be forced to buy items in order to play it to its full potential. But, so far, I have not been asked to buy anything. So again, I wonder if people actually downloaded the same game I did before reviewing it.I don't really see this as a "must have" game. For a buck or whatever it was, it's okay. Throw a grenade, land it close to the enemy, hope they blow up. Pretty basic. Pretty repetitive.I got this for free today, and definitely see why it will appeal to some. I'm not crazy about it. I'm glad that I didn't buy it either. It's like the cousin game of Stupid Zombies or Angry Birds. Neither of which I play anymore. If that's your kind of game, this is right up your alley.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B0055DUUDE 2 1308441600 123 Loved this game when I had the EVO 4g. Smooth gameplay, polished graphics, pleasant audio. Then I upgraded to the EVO 3D, and it crashes or freezes constantly. I got to play once then every other time it has frozen on the launch screen or menu. Bummer, I really like this game. By reading other reviews, it seems that there are a lot of people with problems. Has never been updated, that I've seen, since the launch on the Amazon App Store. Looks like the developer just doesn't want to make things work. I'd think twice about buying this until there are some changes made. $2.99 just to find out if it installs and plays on your handset or tablet is not cool.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B0058VW36U 4 1317168000 53 Free today, but worth a dollar any day. Nice polished graphics, sound, smooth game play. This is a little bit challenging at times, not frustrating though. Fun for all ages. If you enjoy games like Angry Birds or Stupid Zombies, this is a great addition to your phone or tablet. EVO 3D user.
A11EJ2HFWMAAFL B004LZFWJO 2 1319846400 191 I got this as the free app of the day, so I'm more than glad to do an honest review. It installed fine on my EVO 3D and it plays ok. The biggest problem right off the bat is that it doesn't fit my screen fully. Ok, not exactly a deal breaker in this situation, but had I purchased it for $3 it would be. I see people complaining about not swiping patterns correctly. I would disagree. It's was very responsive. The music, eh. It could be better. My biggest complaint is that it's way too easy for me or probably any adult. Seriously, you can score points by connecting 2 pieces in a row. How hard is that? They're all over the game board. But I can see how kids might love this.Final thought. This is not for me. I've already uninstalled it. It's not the worst game I've tried, but far from great or worth the money. That's why I give it 2 stars. Had I paid $3 for it, I'd be really pissed. Those who let their kids play on their handheld devices might find value in this.
A11EKGMYTG78L5 B006C1DH92 5 1326499200 20 I don't have this game but I could tell I would LOVE this game just by looking at this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A11EKGMYTG78L5 B007SYWFRM 5 1337385600 34 it has mini games and a regular game!I think it is super fun doing both!!!it is kind of a good thing to learn from because you have to give poor animal a great home.

A11EKPC0C3KPZQ B004VOJT0I 5 1356652800 33 I use this site religiously.  Truly my &#34;go to&#34;.  I read all reviews and I get compliments all the time on my cooking.  I love to cook and I love to enjoy food!!!
A11EKPC0C3KPZQ B004MC0FO8 5 1356652800 25 I use this frequently and then go to Itunes and purchase what I shazamed!!!  It has helped bring back old artists I had forgetten about.
A11EKPC0C3KPZQ B004HXHVZ8 5 1356652800 21 Major movie buff and I use this site weekly to determine what movies I want to see and you should too.
A11ENQHHUUDHN5 B008V06NRU 5 1381795200 34 My pou is adorable I love this game so much! The mini games you can play with your pou are really fun. I like to customize and decorate my pou and my pou house.
A11ENQHHUUDHN5 B00DJYC55C 4 1386633600 67 I got this game a long time ago and it's really fun! But lately people have been saying it's horrible and stalking. Angela never asks me inappropriate things, and I think it's because I have the older version. I haven't done an update and probably never will if it changes Angela to a stalker. I don't recommend this app if you are getting the new version .
A11EPH5ACTE8TZ B005HSL626 4 1328400000 51 This game is so simple at first it appears to be too simple.  But we cannot put it down.  It is a perfect game for those times you want a diversion for a few minutes.  Beware though a few minutes could turn into a lot longer before you put it down.
A11EPH5ACTE8TZ B006SMLAMQ 5 1332115200 65 I really like this app.  It reminds me of spb weather i had on windows mobile.  It is beautiful, and it does have widgets.  They are listed under &quot;a&quot; not &quot;w&quot; for some reason.  I love that it gives more detail than picture for pecipitation.  It is too soon to se how accurate it is, but so far I like it better than beatiful widgets.
A11EPH5ACTE8TZ B006VW94HQ 4 1342828800 27 I have enjoyed this game. It is simple and easy to use.  It is perfect for when you want to spend a few minutes on a game.
A11EQ4GOUERD2B B004Q3CJQ0 5 1325808000 25 I use it at night to see walking around my room while the hubby sleeps. The police lights option is fun as well!  #kidatheart :)
A11EQ4GOUERD2B B004H6WTJI 5 1325808000 24 LOVE IT!! It tracks your weight, carbs, execise, fat intake, water intake and even gives you a thumbs up!  Don't think, get it now!
A11ERRMJ293XUF B0086700CM 3 1345420800 26 this app is great for my kindle but I like it better on the iphone but other than that I recommend this app for anyone :)
A11ERRMJ293XUF B007XKEY6Q 4 1349222400 33 its pretty fun but it gets boring waiting for the people to like draw something back. other than that it is an awesome game. I recommend to anyone who likes to draw! ;)
A11ERRMJ293XUF B006PH7WBM 5 1345507200 96 I recommend this game to anyone is is into fashion. In this app u get to have a fashion store and u get to name it.You have nieghbors you can visit and you can like their clothing items and it will both permits their shop and yours. You cam also dress up your caracter to the way u like it and you have a varitry of clothing to choose from.As you level up you get more clothing to sell and more clothing to choose from to wear. This app is the best FREE fashion app ever!!!!!!!
A11ERRMJ293XUF B00A0YXZVW 4 1356307200 22 its a great app. the only bothersome point is that you have to connect to facebook and frankly not everyone has one
A11EU5AUMK99C7 B00AF6MF9I 4 1399334400 53 Have only been playing for a few days, but have been totally addicted to it.  Really enjoying it.  However, I'm not enjoying how quickly my battery drains.  It seems to really eat up power, even when not actively playing the game.  So far, that's been the biggest frustration.  Otherwise, it's a good game.
A11EU5AUMK99C7 B008MEM24S 5 1359936000 32 Absolutely love this game. I've played it over and over and still enjoy playing the same levels, although I do look forward to the new ones as well. Challenging, yet not overwhelming.
A11EU5AUMK99C7 B00AECDDYY 5 1402444800 38 Super simple game that is easy to play and hard to put down!  Relatively challenging even on the easier levels, but still fun to play.  Graphics are nice and the game loads quickly (GS3).  Definitely recommend this game!
A11F23GZKIST3U B0066T8SDU 5 1357171200 25 This game is realy a good one very happy with it works good on kindle fire I would recommen to everyone who likes word games.
A11F23GZKIST3U B006ZE9Q5A 1 1359504000 30 This is a bad game you can't get it to work right it only goes so far so I had to delete it so I lost my .99 on it.
A11F23GZKIST3U B007N8RULO 5 1357171200 28 i like this game to pass the time away it works good on my kindle fire i would recommen this game to any one who likes card games.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00DJFIMW6 1 1376438400 21 It stopped working the second time that I tried to play it so I really can't give a review on it.
A11F23GZKIST3U B004SBS8LA 3 1371686400 29 Its ok I just can't seam to hit much of the stuff to get to far I hope to get better at it as I go along with it.
A11F23GZKIST3U B009EEFTMC 5 1371686400 29 I love this its one of the best games that I have got so far you can realy pass a lot of time playing this game and its relaxing.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00AIUUXHC 3 1371686400 30 Its ok I guess I haven't played it much so I don't know how to play it very good and I don't get far with it befor my shark dies.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00CELIPL4 5 1371686400 22 Hidden Object-Journey into the Wilderness I think this one is better because you can see it to find what hidden in it.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00DUF0MOQ 5 1387065600 55 I love this solitaire game its so much better then solitaire its so much fun to play and you don't get bored with it if you like solitaire you will love this one I laugh so much when playing this its the best one yet so get it you won't go wrong with this game.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00CAK052Q 5 1372377600 45 I like this game a lot its different then other games I got its fun to run your truck over the hills and smash into stuff and if you make the run you get another truck its a lot of fun I recommend this game.
A11F23GZKIST3U B009LFGG76 5 1386374400 29 I realy like it its very relaxing I would recommend it to every one who likes word games it has been working good so just get it and relax.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00BPC23XO 4 1372377600 34 I like it but a lot of times you can't guess the word its still fun you can pass a lot of time playing it so give It a try you will like it.
A11F23GZKIST3U B0084DYNGC 2 1371686400 34 The game is stop on one screen and I can't get off of it.so I don't don't  know what to do with it I guess I might delete it if it don't work out.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00A4EZ3QS 3 1372377600 33 Its ok but not much to it I guess if you play this kind of games you will like it so give it a try after all its free you can't beat that.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00EKDZEF4 5 1382313600 61 I absolutely love it its one of the best games that I have got so far every one tells me that its like candy crush saga but I have never played that one so I would not know about that but you can't go wrong with this game so I would say absolutely get it if you like candy crush games.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00FAPF5U0 3 1383609600 37 Candy Crush Saga is not as good as Fruit Drops Puzzle games to me but its ok I just like the fruit drop games better real good games to past the time away real relaxing and entertaining.
A11F23GZKIST3U B008O661PK 1 1359504000 26 This is terrible I can't even play this game it was not worth the .99 that I paid for it I deleted it from kindle fire.
A11F23GZKIST3U B00CX713IG 5 1376438400 43 I love this game it's the best hidden objects game that I have got the only thing is that I can't get it to zoom in when  playing it I have been playing it so much you can't go wrong with this game.
A11F23GZKIST3U B008JGSM6G 5 1371686400 43 I love this I play it all the time its as good as Cubistry it gets you hooked so you can't put it down I find myself playing these two games all the time so get these two and you can't go wrong.
A11F27UM54FF B00K7C17QW 4 1403395200 142 I love the game if you if you have time and patience then this game is for you. First I like the hidden object part of the game but that may not be for you. You earn a score by finding things in the scenes and it earns you stars to process evidence. My main problems with the game is that the game has a lit of application errors with start up and often prints me the game is not working but if I hut wait it usually starts working. The game freezes at times as well and randomly shuts down if they can fix these issues I would give the fame five stars. It us worth noting before you but this game that it uses an energy bar that requires time for your energy to grow back. Several hours at least.
A11F27UM54FF B007OX6DIY 2 1396569600 36 I don't know why they released this game on the kindle my game is so hard to control and it runs slow, eats to much battery, as well as shuts down on it's own quite often.
A11F27UM54FF B00933JL0A 3 1396569600 66 This game starts on a good idea but is not developed for me if they added more to do i would gladly pay up to three dollars for this app it reminds me of Sim City if you play it you will like it but gets boring after a bit as it is always the same thing repeating itself so i recommend but it needs work.
A11F27UM54FF B0062R5GJ0 4 1339027200 26 this is a good product but i wish it would send email reminders. as well as back up your segual. over all im happy with it.
A11F27UM54FF B004NE3T8Y 1 1403395200 26 It requires a paid subscription after a while I keep getting spam mail from them asking me to renew. I would not buy not worth it.
A11F27UM54FF B00632HWOG 4 1399680000 47 I like this app however it is not easy to get to my contact list. Or create a new file to store things in. I want to see a fully functional yahoo email app that is simpler to use and figure out than the current one is.
A11F27UM54FF B007HGMVIE 1 1396569600 46 it needs internet i hate that come on i want a good sim game that dose not need the internet i am willing to give some memory for it or even pay for it but i have nit found anything yet that is like SIm City.
A11F27UM54FF B00GCI69D6 1 1399507200 52 This app took me an hour to figure out and that is all I need to say. But let me tell you is dose have some interesting information if you can use it in the first place. A lot of it I can find in the paper or  in my Web browser.
A11F27UM54FF B008VBYN80 2 1396569600 22 it requires internet that is not something i always have so this is not a good fit for me sorry to say.
A11F3QRWUZBIVW B007PW1BZY 3 1393804800 63 I find it disappointing that a computer has to &quot;cheat&quot; to win. With this game if you are getting ahead in the phases and have a very low score you start to get skipped a lot or may not even get to play at all. Having said that I still enjoy the game it's easy enough my 7yr old can grasp the concept.
A11F3QRWUZBIVW B00BX736EG 4 1372291200 42 my six year old can play this game. this is a game for all ages it starts out fairly easy but each level gets a little harder. there are some that after you figure them out you have a well duh moment.
A11F3QRWUZBIVW B00D0VZLVE 4 1372377600 42 this game really makes you think some of the phrases are very challenging. there are phrases that I have never heard before which only adds to the game. I wish you could earn more points for solving glad there's a skip option.
A11F3QRWUZBIVW B0066T8SDU 3 1371600000 35 I had to download this game a second time due to a mistake I lost EVERYTHING.  This. game is different from the one I previously had &amp; it freezes a lot. I am very disappointed.
A11F3QRWUZBIVW B00C8R8TZ6 3 1371859200 50 when I got this app I didn't realize it was like the puzzle picture app where you uncover the pictures. I think it's ridiculous how many points you have to use for a hint(70 points for one letter) but other than that it's an ok way to pass the time
A11F3QRWUZBIVW B00D0VA0UQ 4 1372550400 34 these are really fun games to play. my daughter is only six and she loves playing this game too.  I'm so glad they have the skip option sometimes you just need a second look.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B004JZBGWI 5 1385683200 50 I just got a new phone and tablet and the first thing I downloaded to both was this app.  I use it for grocery shopping, lists of to do's and list for other tasks that I have to get done.  A great application and free.  What more can you ask?
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B008P1EWIM 5 1385683200 66 I just got a new phone and tablet and knew I had to have this app on both.  Have it on my old phone and tablet and it comes in very handy when traveling.  This app stores various locations so when I am on the road, all I have to do is select my current location.  It is accurate and provides a plethora of weather information.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B00JBNS6KS 3 1400716800 90 I only give this 3 stars because I am finding it difficult to move beyond a level.  I have played one game may 30 times and no matter the different strategies employed, I still can not win the game before the time runs out.  I have quit playing the game.  Perhaps it would be helpful with the player cannot win a game for the developers to provide a hint of some kind.  Otherwise, the game is fun and could be more fun if there was a means to move on.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B0052UZIFA 5 1385683200 56 I have this game on my old phone and tablet and loved it.  So when I got a new phone/tablet I knew, knew I had to buy it again.  The game is fun and funny, both.  It's also challenging.  The zombies can be quite frustrating and funny.  I love to beat them at their own game.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B0066T8OH0 5 1385683200 38 This is a fun, but challenging game.  I love to play it and intersperse it with other of my &#34;I love&#34; games.  Always trying to beat my high score and fail quite often.  I recommend this to 'thinkers'.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B0066T0BTO 3 1385683200 66 Don't like this game even though I love Bejeweled.  I thought I purchased it but I seem to have lots of ads.  And I'm not sure I understand the game options.  In all fairness, I haven't spent much time with it but every time I play it I get frustrated so I don't play it.  Will do research to see if I have a 'free' version.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B00FAPF5U0 3 1400716800 63 This is another 'free' game that nickels and dimes you to death if you want to continue.  My review of Lost Jewels goes into more detail regarding this annoying trend.  As I said before, I would prefer to purchase the game rather than getting it for free.  For this of you who don't mind paying for every little thing, it's a fun game.
A11F4XYP7WQ874 B00FWPWNKS 4 1388966400 58 This game is fun to play.  I only gave it 4 starts because even though I paid for it there is still advertising for the company's other game.  I also have the other game and it too has an add to purchase their games.  Annoying.  Other than that, the game is fun and challenging at the higher leves.
A11F65MPVVTNW3 B005URX4OC 1 1318377600 23 My phone is Duel core 1GHz not fast enough. Will not also play sound gives error. I've hundred memory free also ram wise.
A11F65MPVVTNW3 B00HY5QKHQ 4 1394496000 30 Seems like a fun and interesting game. I wish it would allow you to wait to review this until further along in the game. But so far I like it.
A11F65MPVVTNW3 B007V2UGPE 1 1338508800 87 The glu points you earn in game and out of game I never Received. I tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it still never received them. I at least get my silver coins but never the gold ones. You know when I install other games like it says for certain point I don't always get them either. I don't know if it is because I run CM7 OS or not. I doubt it is because of that. So I don't run anymore these games from this company.
A11F6IL8DHOFEZ B00EBE8MUG 3 1399334400 22 Just started playing. I must not watch much TV because I have to think about the easy ones. It's Ok so far.
A11F6IL8DHOFEZ B0091REZMW 4 1372032000 18 fnot a bad game. haven't had to pay for anything. frequent ads annoying but it is a freebie.
A11F6IL8DHOFEZ B006QMYF0W 5 1377388800 25 I like Branium games and this is no exception. Nice graphics and smooth play. Worth the .99 to not have to put up with adds.
A11F6IL8DHOFEZ B007GE0X3M 5 1336262400 23 Waited a while to download this app (still liked my newspaper) . Now I use it multiple times a day. Really like it.
A11F6IL8DHOFEZ B0064X7FVE 1 1376697600 20 Not a fan of the new app. Liked the old one a LOT better. Using Accuweather a lot more now.
A11F7FGVCEXHRR B007SYWFRM 5 1393286400 22 It is an awesome game. I love designing my own little village. I have to fight my kids for game time lol.
A11F7FGVCEXHRR B00AESN8XY 5 1395446400 23 I love this game! Probably my favorite to play. I've played this game at least a hundred times and it never gets boring.
A11F9V8LV3L7FE B00AK0X5VQ 5 1388966400 25 Its very fun but can be nerve racking its like the orbs are learning your moves, lol. Would recommend to anyone. Already gotten pretty far
A11F9V8LV3L7FE B007SYWFRM 5 1342310400 21 loved it I reccomend to any one who likes building villages and the clip scenes are cute. always something to do
A11F9V8LV3L7FE B00FAPF5U0 3 1388102400 61 I'm thankful its finally on my kindle ive been waiting awhile. everything works great but I cant use any of the extra moves my friends give me. I keep getting gifts and the only thing I can use is the extra lives not the moves. it would have been 5 stars if it did but it don't.  I find it frustrating
A11F9V8LV3L7FE B006OBWGHO 5 1341619200 27 This game is a lot of fun.  I was weary about all the negative reviews but downloaded it anyways i'm happy I did.  haven't had any problems
A11FB94S2FYP7B B0066T0BTO 5 1362700800 28 This game is as good as the original I had on my PC.  The sounds and visual effects  are true to the original.  Very delightful and still addictive.
A11FB94S2FYP7B B00AEJPK0C 4 1376006400 22 This my speed. Have to look at it differently than other match 3's. I keep going back to this one. Nice graphics.
A11FB94S2FYP7B B00A9JG6RS 2 1367712000 50 I don't find any challenge in this game..  May be better for young  kids. I especially don't like the new era games like this and Candy Crush that invite you to spend real money for extra's. I'll take Luxor and BeJeweled any day thank you!  Will be deleting very soon.
A11FB94S2FYP7B B00CJ8P82Q 5 1371686400 40 This is more like my favorites, Luxor and Zuma!  You do have to think fast which gives one a challenge. I just wish it was bigger. Sound effects and visuals are good. I'm going to play right now ;  )
A11FB94S2FYP7B B00FAPF5U0 5 1383091200 108 Ive invited other friends who have become addicted to this fun game! If games keep us young then my 74 years should be back to infancy by now.! I like that I can interact with others to keep the game going when I run out of &#34;lives&#34;. Another favorite is Papa Pear.  Keep these coming, they are keeping us thinking and having fun! The only downside is the annoying way all those ads run on the sides & bottom of the games. I'd be willing to pay for ad-free games. Those advertisers must be desperate to be so annoying.! All they do is turn me off their product!
A11FB94S2FYP7B B004SCQABY 3 1376006400 23 This was fun for awhile. I couldn't.land more than 12 so after so many tries I finally gave up.Fun but not for me!
A11FBS734SR2H0 B006VXRNYG 5 1366156800 22 This is a great app for all ages. My grand kids enjoy drawing and playing games like tic tac toe or hangman.
A11FBS734SR2H0 B00BFWY2KG 1 1366156800 22 I cannot use on my kindle. You need to connect with your cable provider too complicated. I just will have to delete.
A11FBS734SR2H0 B00BJQKQH6 3 1366156800 23 I got this app for my grandson and he is ok with it.  He really has not played with it but maybe twice
A11FBS734SR2H0 B00HEFEDAM 5 1398988800 21 I enjoy playing with this app.  My grandbaby also plays with it and enjoys it as much or more than me.
A11FHC0N2X4UHS B0054JZC6E 1 1359417600 44 Wow! The amount of ads are ridiculous. The first game I played involved a rocket that continuously shot bullets. All i had to do was move the rocket left to right. BORING! Just about every move was  by an add. I shall uninstall now!
A11FHC0N2X4UHS B0064X7FVE 1 1398643200 20 gives only the most basic information. visual maps don't exist. I'm in a storm and it says it's not raining.
A11FHC0N2X4UHS B009XFDFPU 4 1362787200 94 It took a while for me to figure this game out. But once I did it turned to be kind of fun.Tip: press the question mark on the bottom left corner of the screen then the item on the screen you have a question about and you will get info.Bad: If you wait to long to make a move, it will tell you what move to make. I wish you could turn that off!Bad: The Zen mode shouldn't have a time limit. It's hard to reach a zen state when you're racing against time.
A11FHC0N2X4UHS B009S98W3Q 4 1357430400 20 for a free game this offers days of entertainment. Although the level stars Don't always show  you completed a level.
A11FHC0N2X4UHS B008QZ1ZYQ 2 1379289600 60 This was fun for a while but there are NO directions. What's with the yellow lines that appear? They make me lose every time because I don't know how to deal with them. And what's with the multiple threads? How do I deal with them? I'm only at the beginning and I have know tips at all. Directions directions directions!
A11FHC0N2X4UHS B006GWE5PM 2 1360454400 31 Kind of good. Not a lot of variety in the courses. The scoring is completely inaccurate. The graphics are good. NO variety between the courses. The timed courses suck big time!
A11FHC117DPVZW B00FAX6XQC 4 1388016000 37 Nice app but it would be nicer if the energy had a timer on it for offline play. Kinda sucks  that crashes all the time on my iPad 2 and now it does it on my kindle
A11FHC117DPVZW B00BJQKQH6 3 1388188800 46 This game is absolutely amazing. Ea knew what they were doing here. I just. Thought it would be nice if you could see what's behind you in your mirror and if the repair and delivery etc were not that long. But  this game will keep you
A11FHUJQBWWE4F B00AKOB7CG 3 1357603200 34 except doing exercises alone after looking at photos of the proper form, these are videos that show the moves so they areeasy to understand and copy. It &#34;feels&#34; like you have an exercise buddy.
A11FHUJQBWWE4F B00AEEZK70 4 1360195200 37 If I have a short amount of time, it fills the space with pleasurable concentration on a problem that can be solved.It plays well on my kindle fire, and gets my heart pumping as the levels increase.
A11FMLCHMB8638 B004JJR2K4 3 1306022400 23 i dont want to root. i dont care about cords needed. but i do wonder why pdanet isnt here but this one is
A11FMLCHMB8638 B005BFMQJC 3 1310256000 20 that way in 2013 when i download apps it will actually work with my device. android phones are the suck.
A11FMLCHMB8638 B006D1ONE4 5 1324857600 29 played it on ipad and loved it...missed the 10 cent sale but thanks amazon for faotd...now if only these devolpers would get out the networks wifi only download bs
A11FMLCHMB8638 B0052UZIFA 1 1306800000 87 I guess you have to buy a new phone every year to keep up with all these awesome apps that are coming to the android/amazon app store. I wonder if this app doesn't work on the iphone 3g. Yes i have the OG droid and yes i will complain because to not get your app to work on a ''flagship'' device under two years of age when everyone gets a two year contract is just wrong and shows your lack of thought or inability at app porting/dev.
A11FMTCS7V9EEO B00JTKDTLE 4 1399680000 25 This game is cool but a little challenging but I like challenging. I think you should make different versions like, easy, medium, hard, and expert.
A11FMTCS7V9EEO B00DJFIMW6 5 1377388800 26 Just love the game! First, it's free, plus if you like Temple Run 1 or 2, or Subway Surfers you'll love Minion Rush!!!!!! LOVE IT !!!!!!!
A11FOKDWHJ38NN B00IKZX1ZI 4 1398902400 36 LOVE this game!  I just wish I could link to Facebook on my Kindle so I can sync with my phone.  I will rate 5 stars if this becomes available.  Great work on the game though!
A11FOKDWHJ38NN B009C7ZQM4 5 1378166400 32 What I like most about this app is that it notifies you when you are using high amounts of memory, so you can clean your running apps and you don't lose speed.
A11FOXF953S37P B0080K98U0 4 1366329600 26 Personally I'm not exactly feeling this game. My boyfriend loves it tho. So he continues to play. It's a fun actiony game. Just not for me.
A11FOXF953S37P B00ABNV49M 3 1366329600 28 This game want all that fun. It became very boring after a while. I liked it at first because it was something new. But it got corny fast.
A11FOXF953S37P B00BXPQN2K 5 1386892800 34 I absolutely love this game. It may be a bit slow going but it keeps you interested for some odd reason. Keeps you wanting to complete the goals to open up the other islands.
A11FS4LL72R9GF B0074AKEDC 3 1332374400 233 This was a really fun game.  I love HOGs and this one has a special something extra in that you need to build your objects and then solve puzzles.  It has unlimited help hints and no timer.Unfortunately, it didn't work past the last part of Chapter 3.  I reinstalled and tried different times to finish Chapter 3 but as soon as I got to the part where I was supposed to place one of the objects I had built in its proper place in the picture, it wouldn't place.  I thought perhaps I was supposed to have done the rooms in a certain order but when I read through the walkthroughs I could find online, they all said to do exactly what I had already tried.  Didn't work.  I can only assume this was a glitch of some kind in the software.  I gave it a rating of 3 stars because it really had a lot of potential if you can get it to work properly.The game cost $.99 so I guess you get what you pay for.EDIT:  I was finally able to get past this area I had difficulty with on Kindle Fire with a stylus pen.  Some of the rotating gears in the game are too close to the edge of the screen to get your objects to stick but with the stylus pen I was able to be more accurate.
A11FS4LL72R9GF B0066HA1A0 5 1333065600 46 this is a tutorial that is quite easy to follow.  took hours because I worked on upgrading and building for investment points before completing goals.  enjoyed the game which played very smoothly on my kindle fire... I liked it enough to upgrade to the pay version.
A11FS4LL72R9GF B006OBWGHO 5 1332892800 32 My grandkids, ages 10 and 5, and i love this game.  Whenever i have trouble finishing a level i skip it and have the 5 year old solve it for me later.
A11FS4LL72R9GF B007PT3QOQ 3 1359676800 178 yesterday, I would have given this game 5 stars.  it was a lot of fun and I spent hours and was close to leveling to 98.  I logged in this morning to work on my town only to find my town was gone and was being asked to start over as so many others had, too. no.  just glad I never spent any money on it.OK, I love playing this game so I restarted.  Once again I got to the point I had previously at about level 92 and suddenly I had a friend's town sitting on the bottom half of mine.  It was a mess and unfixable. I didn't even bother to report it since I saw on the forums that many many other people had had the same problem with no replies.My advice is NOT to spend any real money on this game as you will eventually lose it all in one of the frequent game crashes.  But if you just want a game with no expectations of ever completing much, it's a fun time waster.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B0054JZC6E 1 1341964800 37 there are a lot of glitches in the game. the games would freeze, it wouldn't give me my daily coins, and there are way too many ads! I'll start a game and an ad will pop up!
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B00632HWOG 3 1355616000 39 This app was an amazing email app until I updated it. When I updated it, it slowed down and has to ferry your account almost every time you use the app. If you had the original, don't update it!
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B007XKEY6Q 4 1339200000 25 it is an amazing app but sometimes it won't load. It has just as much stuff ss it could, but I wish there weren't ads.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B00846GKTW 4 1340928000 26 they ask me to share an outfit and I don't have facebook. I don't like that they ask you that. otherwise, this is a cute app.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B008N02WZU 2 1356825600 30 I thought it was fun at first, but then later if became boring. Also, It doesn't have a lot of instruction. It wouldn't be worth full price, or free, actually.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B0071PARPA 5 1339200000 24 I love this app! You can draw professionally by using all the tools. And you can make perfect circles and rectangles with the tools.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B009UWL580 4 1361059200 35 When you run out of grabs in the claw, an ad pops up and then it pesters you to buy more grabs. If it didn't do this, it would be 5 stars instead of 4.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B006OBWGHO 4 1338940800 31 fun app. some levels make it impossible to collect all 3 ducks, I like that they added the extra challenge of finding the hidden objects. Luv that Disney makes it :)
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B0091REZMW 3 1350518400 30 I started the game 2 minutes ago, and it already asked me to download graphics, and rate it. it is a fine app, but I don't appreciate everything it asks.
A11FSWQKAB1MOL B009UX2YAC 5 1356825600 50 I love this app, even though it is a lot like temple run. The graphics are good, it lets you turn off the seasonal mode if it annoys you, especially during Christmastime. It has everything you may want from temple run but didn't get, and you don't have to tilt.
A11FUKRZZYDKUN B00FZHIQK4 2 1387065600 25 I couldn't control this game very well.  The premise seems fun and is a good idea, but I just couldn't get it to work well.
A11FUKRZZYDKUN B00BTL5YMI 2 1387065600 49 You have to use many coins to be able to win anything.  Then when you get a big win, its hardly any coins.  Then they want you to buy more coins.  Instead I deleted the app.  I liked the slot play itself, but just seemed to expensive to me.
A11FUKRZZYDKUN B00FAX6XQC 5 1387065600 39 Very realistic game play.  Its pretty fun and kind of gross all at the same time.  If you love animals don't play this game.  If you are a hunter, its very interesting and I think you would like it.
A11FUKRZZYDKUN B00BS7E2E4 3 1387065600 20 This app was just okay.  I found that it was just too easy and I lost interest pretty darn quick.
A11FUKRZZYDKUN B00AA87JGU 4 1373673600 39 Very fun way to pass the time.  Each levels difficulty gets more and more challenging.  Only issue is having to pay money for more levels and no tutorial before levels.  Other than that, great game it stimulates my brain.
A11FW6JQLS4NK9 B00A9JG6RS 5 1377216000 20 lots of fun. hard to put down. hate it when I run out of birds but still so much fun.
A11FW6JQLS4NK9 B004YLSLIY 4 1337212800 30 Fun to play and test word knowledge. Minor irritation that some words which should be in it do not come up as valid words. Just need to expand the dictionary.
A11FW6JQLS4NK9 B0071PARPA 3 1386288000 32 Its a good program but not as easy to use as I would like.  Would be better if there were options to use something other than your finger to do the drawing.
A11FXLR9BCJAZW B0064X7B4A 5 1367020800 21 i have friends in brazil, and all over the usa. we keep in touch daily with this game. lots of fun.
A11FXLR9BCJAZW B004SYNIJ4 5 1370044800 27 All you need to know, when you need to know it. Watch cbs new in the morning evening and late at night.it i my station of choice
A11FXLR9BCJAZW B0063IH60K 5 1365033600 20 Quick easy game. No time limits which is good. Sometimes you win, sometimes you loose but you always have fun.
A11FYK1Q9YI31N B004K4RY9M 5 1365897600 23 it is really good for your brain :-) and it can helpless you learn new words and it helps you find long words
A11FYK1Q9YI31N B00KWVZ750 5 1402963200 166 I freakn love this game because the graphics are awesome and the characters areAwesome but there's one little problem that I don't like I don't like how you can only pick 3 birds to go battle  while the pigs have more pigs on there team and the pigs get bigger and better pig on there team but I like how if you trouble completing a level you can get help from the computer and I like how you get to borrow a Bird crime your friend but it has to be a friend on Facebook but I don't have face book but it gave me a friend called piggie Mic cool and I have been playing this game till 3 o clock an d 2 o clock and 1 o clock in the morning each day and you got to  believe me so I give this game a 5 star rating so please agree with me so if you like angry Birds you would love this
A11FYK1Q9YI31N B00FJLK3WU 1 1382832000 45 It doesn't work because it keeps saying that it can't be installed on my kindle fire because I tried to get it off of the cloud from my mom's kindle fire hd and it keeps saying that there is an error trying to install it.
A11FYK1Q9YI31N B00CEKIGGO 5 1386460800 31 This game is awesome I love how you can upgrade your own land and go toother places and also check out the best free game in the world. calledSmurfs village aaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssoooooooooooooooooooooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
A11FZINQN80FTT B004SJ3BCI 4 1332547200 88 I love it and its really cool. I like to play this on my Kindle fire but when I saw that there was a level on the iPad that is not on the Kindle I felt confused about why this is happening since we should all get the equal amount of levels no matter if you get the free or paid version. The weird part was that when I came to see if there were any updates there was none! I would like to know why this happened.
A11FZINQN80FTT B0061SLW7A 5 1330732800 36 I was using this one day and I thought it was incredible. it knows my name and birthday it gives me advice in everything including sibling rivalry. it just gave me a boost in my life.
A11FZINQN80FTT B008JK6W5K 5 1358640000 26 Even though I didn't know all the logos I let some of my friends play and they stole my kindle literally and guessed so many logos

A11G4CHZW1PVKA B008Y2FRFO 5 1389052800 25 This is a game that is fun to play if you enjoy playing the slots, even if you don't you will have fun with this
A11G4CHZW1PVKA B00FAPF5U0 5 1389052800 26 this is a very addictive game but it is a lot of fun to play and if you can get a challenge it is much better
A11G4CHZW1PVKA B00FAX6XQC 4 1388966400 20 a lot of fun for someone who doesn't hunt and knows nothing about guns and hunters would enjoy this game
A11G4CHZW1PVKA B00D948SS0 5 1388966400 20 luv it, it is a very enjoyable game for people who like a challenge and have patients. check it out
A11GAZ6LM27F5O B00AZZGOWI 5 1369699200 19 Awesome and funThis is a great app for a capitalist. And some one that likes long term time investment
A11GAZ6LM27F5O B00H44JGU0 3 1396828800 22 It would like it if they zoomed up on the face drawing parts! It would also be better if.they gave you tips
A11GB1UYG37R0E B009HKL4B8 5 1371513600 55 This is my favorite game ever!! Its super fun to play, and you only have to pay if you are super impatient. I showed it to my friend and she loved it to. Now its the game that we both love and we play every time we see eachother. I would definitely recomend this game.
A11GB1UYG37R0E B00ERXVOII 4 1380412800 33 it told me to write this so I did. its a fun game but its kind of hard. you tap the screen to make the ball bounce and you try to collect stars.
A11GB1UYG37R0E B00G5LQ5MU 4 1384473600 23 this game is fun! I really enjoy this game. its kind of hard sometimes. it told me to review this so I did.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B008393Q2O 5 1371427200 114 I've been very pleased with this software. I got it as the FAOTD, but would gladly pay the $2 for the product.SkinnyNote has the ability to create checklists (I use mine for short grocery lists and to-do lists), text notes, and also draw notes. Since I do not have a stylus, the draw notes look a bit ragged on my screen, but are still legible.There are NO ads, NO annoying messages asking you to purchase anything else, and the interface is clean, simple, and easy to use.Once you have created notes, you can search and sort through them, and can also set reminders to notify you if you want.Excellent clean product, pleased to recommend.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B007N6NGYG 1 1369699200 220 The game itself was very interesting and enjoyable. I got this as the FAOTD, and after playing it a bit and checking that it had nothing objectionable, and no in-app purchases, I added it to my children's FreeTime account (games that they can play when logged in). Much to my surprise, a few days later, an "update" had changed the game so that in app purchasing was very obvious. Even though it is blocked on my device (Kindle Fire 2nd gen), the kids got frustrated because they'd keep ending up in screens that they weren't allowed to do anything on.I also dislike the ability to get "free" in-game currency by completing "offers." YUK!In addition, the game really DOES have a huge learning curve. The first puzzles are GREAT and I was really enjoying them, but as you move on, the gameplay takes a HUGE leap and suddenly you are no longer figuring things out by thinking about them. Instead, you are playing and crashing things multiple times in a vain attempt to learn which tunnels lead to which other locations, and what the (seemingly randomly assigned) delay will be before your train reappears. Those levels made me lose interest, as I don't like having to use trial and error 50+ times on a single level. It then becomes grindingly boring.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00AQ5KYVE 2 1369526400 114 I thought this would be a good way for my kids to earn rewards, but quickly found several bugs (or at least quirks) in the way that it works.My main problem is that the kids are not able to view or keep track of their rewards/charts themselves. I have to go in, sign in with my password, and go to the chart. This means that the app itself has very little worth to me. I would be better off printing off a chart, taping it to my fridge and getting old-school star stickers. At least the kids would be able to see their list of things to do without me having to do anything.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00DQR26EC 2 1391040000 293 I enjoyed playing through the sometimes-predictable story, which poked fun at various games along the way. This enjoyment was enough to keep me playing through the multitude of crashes to finish the story, but not enough to make me want to continue playing to get the extra things at the end.Crash issues: These came in several varieties. Sometimes the game would simply &#34;hang&#34; with the screen exactly as last shown, including the buttons appearing on the sides where I had been entering commands. These would not actually close, but usually just stayed like this (for over 10 minutes, if I let it) until I manually closed the app. Sometimes the game would simply just close itself, and I would suddenly be back on my home screen, with all progress lost. Sometimes I would get the generic message that the app was &#34;not responding&#34; and get the option to wait or to close. (Waiting NEVER fixed this, I always eventually had to close.)These crashes happened more and more frequently as the end of the game approached. I had over 20 crashes within a 2 hour period, several of which were in the exact same location and led to me fearing I would not be able to complete the game.After completing the story, I wanted to do some of the extra sidequests and secrets, but EVERY time I wandered around on the main world map, the game crashed after the first random encounter. After 5+ times of trying this, I gave up, deleted my save game and uninstalled the app.If the game worked well, I would definitely be playing this a LOT, as I enjoyed finding secrets and running into sidequests... but with all the crash issues, I just don't have the time/patience to continue.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00881VLCE 1 1372032000 20 Got this, but quickly got annoyed by the ads wanting me to buy additional items and the in app purchasing.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B009MO89Y4 5 1369612800 128 This game is one of my kids' favorites. Each level allows you to place various items (the names are spoken aloud so you learn what they are) and as you finish a level, the items and written words are placed in a scrapbook for review. The levels also feature minigames (the shopping level has you finding items on a shelf to put into a cart as the shoppers walk by, the carnival level has a game where you throw a ball at stacked rubber ducks to win prizes, one level has a train that you ride in to see the countryside, etc.) There is a lot of variety and my boys (ages 2 and 4) play this game frequently. It is one of my 2 year old's favorites.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00846WWVM 2 1369612800 40 This game had controls that were difficult to use. I found myself losing levels because I could not move the water to the correct place quickly enough. Something more intuitive, with less motions needed, would make the game much better.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00BJRH6HS 3 1371168000 77 The game itself works perfectly on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen. However, gameplay is extremely simplistic. I find the levels to be easy, rarely taking more than a few minutes, so no challenge, and the repetition is boring. However, others who I showed the game had difficulty, so perhaps my brain already uses both sides well? I got this as the free app of the day, but will likely remove it to make room for bigger challenges.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00BTJMS1A 5 1369612800 192 After playing through the game (with much frustration when I had to stop playing and could not pause and my person died...), I emailed the developer, requesting a pause feature. Much to my surprise, I got a quick reply informing me that to pause the game, all you have to do is press the back button. I never would have thought of that in a million years, but it makes playing the game SO much easier!The game itself is fun, has a retro feel, and made me a bit nostalgic for my childhood. (I'm 30-something).I really enjoyed the gameplay, the objectives in each level were fun to meet, and the various tips that appeared when retrying a level after you failed definitely made playing the game easier.It is nice that you can continue to play this game after you escape (win), but would be nice if the developer would add some extra objectives so that continuing the gameplay has a challenge. (I've already emailed the developer to suggest this.)I feel bad getting this as the FAOTD, as I would gladly pay the $2 for the amount of enjoyment it has given me.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00B5KHZA2 2 1371340800 74 I was unhappy to find that this game excessively promoted the other games the company sells. That distracted from the game. The menu interface was poorly designed, and the game itself merely another find the objects game with images that were not as appealing as could be hoped. I could see how some people might find the images objectionable for young children. All in all, not even worth the space as a free app.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B004SBQGHS 1 1355702400 199 I really enjoy the Angry Birds game, and so I thought that I would help the developers (and myself) by purchasing the ad-free version.What they neglected to state is that it is NOT truly ad-free. There are ads for their in-app purchases (which increase from the free game), ads for the other angry birds games, and other ads for the angry birds franchise.The ads for the angry birds star wars version show up after what seems like every level, and to make matters worse, the prices stated in their ads aren't even correct. It seemed to me as though there were MORE ads in the "ad-free" version than there were in the original free edition.I was extremely upset and frustrated, as I purchased the so-called "ad free" version so that my toddlers could play without having to worry about them clicking on ads and having problems, but instead they have MORE ads.I had also purchased the Star Wars version, and annoyingly enough, the Star Wars Angry Birds links inside the other games continued to point to the ads trying to get me to purchase something I had already bought.I have reverted to the real free version for more enjoyment.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B00C7TAF3Y 4 1369353600 154 The game was fun to play. I liked the puzzles and the way it drew me further and further in.The hint system was helpful. In several cases, it gave me a nudge in the right direction without spoiling the game. For instance, I had not realized that the game made use of sensors to determine the tilt of some puzzles.I wish there was a way to have more than one person able to play at the same time. My husband had to wait for me to finish.I did not much care for the occultist feel as the game went on, either. And I hope future games have happier endings.However, I did enjoy the game mechanics and the way it made me look closely and think to solve the puzzles. As several other reviewers have noted, the game did have a Myst-like feel to it, so fans of those games will probably like this one.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B007N9FKCY 2 1363910400 50 This game was mildly amusing, but I couldn't get very far as the controls were very touchy and hard to play on my Kindle Fire (2nd gen). It would be a much better game to play on a computer or other device with actual keys rather than a touch screen.
A11GBDVXJSTXSX B009P8EMCK 1 1354233600 51 This would be nice if it really worked. However, there are obviously still bugs. I am using Kindle Fire 2nd ed. The app loads but the episodes do not. Doesn't hurt anything to try it, though. Maybe it will work for you. If not, be sure to submit a bug report!
A11GC0V2S614WO B00AB7HESI 2 1372550400 42 I have this app on my ipad and ipod and it downloaded fine, but why wont it load on my kindle fire (1st gen)? can one of u awesome peoples help me out here???but btw, this IS a gr8 app... just sayin...WHATEVES!!!

A11GC0V2S614WO B008CG839O 1 1372809600 69 ok, so I started this game yesterday, and I really liked it... but today, I pressed on a certain dress that costs 15 gems, I thought I was just trying it on, then BAM!!! there goes ALL my gems (I only had 15 gems)!!! I think they should've at least asked me to CONFIRM that I was about to buy that STUPID dress!!!but its still pretty fun... um... WHATEVES!!!
A11GC0V2S614WO B007KPOZK4 4 1361318400 58 I got stardom: Hollywood on my iPad like 2 days ago and I couldn't put it down but the only thing I hate about it is having 2 pay real money 4 things and the STUPID 5 minuet wait for energy... it should be at least 2 minuets... other than that it's a great game so.... WHATEVES!!! :)
A11GC0V2S614WO B004SZ1U66 4 1372723200 69 I play this game alot and its really entertaining but I wouldn't know why everyone is complaining about it costing  $4.00 because I got it as the FAP (Free App of the Day.) so its not that big of a deal to me that it has IAPs (In App Purchases.) so to all you peoples complaining about the price, I'm sorry, but I don't understand your anger...uh, um... WHATEVES!!!
A11GC0V2S614WO B006SM220A 4 1341964800 25 what does a girl have to do too find the stupid master bathroom key!!! it is so hard!!!  other than that, it rocks!!! so... WHATEVS!!!
A11GEMYR67OM67 B008H4MVRG 5 1357257600 21 I love it, it's very adorable, Its a good game to play if you want to waste time due to boredom
A11GEMYR67OM67 B007KPOZK4 5 1373587200 38 I like the game but I don't like the energy regain time, you have to go all over town clicking trash cans, cars, pigeons etc in hopes of getting energy it kinda blows but the game is fun
A11GEMYR67OM67 B0091REZMW 5 1374710400 95 I love this game, it's the best hidden object game I've ever played, it isn't just a hidden object game, there's a mystery plot and its awesome and well thought out. I used to play this game on facebook but bo longer have a computer so when I found out I could play on my kindle fire I was so happy lol, and yes somethings cost real money but if you're immature and impatient then on waiting for energy then yes don't play the game, I'm level 100 and I've yet to spend my money
A11GGFU9V5RL34 B00IZMQ8G0 5 1397520000 74 I purchased this app for my 5 year old and 8 year old.  They both enjoy it a lot.  The trivia questions teach you historical facts and they love that Mr. Peabody talks to you.Negative :  I have still never figured out how to change the character you play as.  It would be nice if the main menu had a clear option for that or allowed you to keep track of individual player's progress.
A11GH6PXAVL7UC B00IG2DOKM 5 1405123200 17 I agree with the other comments.  It's a cute interactive game.  No problems that I've run into.
A11GH6PXAVL7UC B007VT07QU 5 1390089600 24 I just started playing and I'm enjoying it.  I recommend this game.  I'm hoping it's a full game and I'm not required to buy.
A11GH6PXAVL7UC B007PT3QOQ 4 1388016000 23 Have tried playing I don't know how many times and got bored.  Trying again.  I need neighbors but don't know anyone that plays.
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B00CELIPL4 5 1370649600 20 I love this game. I like the games when I have to look for things the more the better.Thank you
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B0063IH60K 5 1358985600 23 I love playing solitaire and love to pass the time of day with it.  I would recommend it to anyone who plays cards.
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B0064TVQ5E 5 1358985600 21 I love playing mahjong but sometimes when I got close to the end I couldn't get it to delete the tiles
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B00B51MR4U 3 1370649600 24 I haven't played this game very much so don't think I can honestly recommend it at this time I'm sure I will enjoy it.
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B008JGSM6G 4 1358985600 20 I liked playing this game.  It was fun and at times it was quite a chalgane to play.  Good game.
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B009UWL580 3 1358812800 25 The game was okay but soon tired of it.  I haven't played it for awhile so maybe I will enjoy it again when I start.
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B004SJ3AXI 2 1358985600 20 I couldn't get the hang of this game in the time limit.  Guess I was to slow.  Wouldn't recommend it.
A11GMQ6QXOZ2IY B007TBAQCK 3 1358985600 22 It was okay but I've had others that are much better.  I don't know if I would recommend this game or not
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B00FAPF5U0 5 1393891200 30 Spent way too much money playing this game. But that is another chapter. It is really nice but does not access the Moonstruck game that I can figure out anyway.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B0064X7FVE 4 1393891200 22 But this is nice when I don't feel like turning the TV on to check for weather conditions.. Nice to track storms.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B0094BB4TW 3 1393891200 26 I just use the browser SILK and get around more easily. Don't really see a need for this app other than that it might be quicker.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B009ZZDNT6 4 1393891200 31 I don't use it, but it appears to be a nice app to have handy for traveling. I use my cellphone for an alarm when I need one on the go.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B00H51RUZK 5 1393891200 30 I use this when I come across a video on Facebook to watch. I also follow other links and it is very nice to be able to access videos with.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B00DLJ31HQ 5 1393372800 20 It is fun seeing how fast you can figure it out. It is challenging and not too hard to complete.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B0064X7B4A 5 1393891200 40 Synced with my Facebook game on my PC. I can use it leisurely in bed as I am unwinding for the night. I use my KindleFire a lot after I turn in for the night and turn off the PC.
A11GTCZA0MEQLH B008P1EWIM 5 1393891200 51 Even though weather men are not correct all th time, it is a good app to plan my weeks with. Some days start out looking really bright and sunny but a storm could be lurking just around the corner. I have had my Nissan turned into a boat once too often.
A11GVGGQFZDUKC B0063IH60K 5 1395360000 39 When I first learned to use  a computer I played a lot of Soltaire. Now that I  own a KindleI am having more fun rediscovering the game. It is on top of my list of fun things To do.
A11GX0US9344GD B0080IOHLW 3 1337558400 67 kind of repetitive and some parts are a bit annoying. kind of one of those games where you don't get the full effects unless you want to buy the developers version of credits but cute and &quot;fun&quot; in that brain melting you just realized you have been playing for 7 hours and you haven't blinked even though this game doesn't really take that kind of effort way
A11GX0US9344GD B008VAGGWM 5 1349568000 25 An awesome game, especially for free. Fairly decent graphics, however, the physics are a bit unrealistic. Mainly doing this review for the free levels. ;3
A11GX0US9344GD B0064B3MG8 5 1339804800 21 Aside from Glu Mobile, this is probably one of the better mobile game studios around. =] More please, if you will.
A11GX0US9344GD B008TMA1LY 5 1349481600 24 Truly an adorable game, while maintaining it's individuality from cafe games, like Diner Dash. Definitely a gem from Sanrio. Who could ask for more?
A11GX2ZLR9K338 B00EKDZEF4 5 1380067200 26 This is one OF THE BEST match 3 games that I have played in a long time. Heavenly Fruit. Kind of makes you hungry for fruit
A11GX2ZLR9K338 B00EDEMLTW 2 1377302400 42 This game is ok. I hate the fact that when you stop in the middle of a game and then go back to it,you have to start over again at the first or 20th level. You can not start where you stopped..
A11GYTUA9V741C B005UQ9FNC 4 1375660800 30 This app is a really good time waster. It is good for kids and really fun. It is not addicting which can be a good thing or a bad thing.
A11GYTUA9V741C B00CKOYVG8 4 1371686400 22 You need facebook to play with friends.  I like the tournament and unlimited power ups.  It's a fun competition against your friends.
A11GYTUA9V741C B005FM77HW 1 1331164800 34 app does not let me open to lock another app or unlock. it makes me sooo mad!!!!!!!!! make some improvements and it will be better. JUST PLEASE LET ME OPEN OR I WILL DELETE!!!!!!!!!!!
A11GYTUA9V741C B00AKEMHCA 5 1375660800 60 This app is great and easy to use. I play balloon tower defense on the computer and this is just like it with more cool stuff! This is much better than going to coolmath and trying to play it. DO NOT GO ON COOLMATH AND TRY TO PLAY IT! This app is absolutely perfect and you should definitely get it.
A11GYTUA9V741C B0086700CM 5 1350086400 43 I love this game! Great graphics and wonderful controls! It is not impossible to buy stuff making the game even more fun. I would recommend this game to every one and anyone who disagrees is stupid. This is a rare find for free!
A11GYTUA9V741C B00846GKTW 5 1337990400 21 I love this game! It is very funn to play! I reccommend this game to anyone who likes or loves fashion.
A11GYTUA9V741C B005KCQZ2K 5 1332460800 80 money is not required at all some assistance cost pet point THAT YOU CAN EARN and some cost money (game money not real money)  if you want like 200 pet points you can earn them by joining sponcering websites (some cost money some don't)  I have made it to level 6 without using real money. Buy this app there is NO MONEY INNVOLVED UNLESS YOU WANT 1,000 PET POINTS so you can buy this app and not spend any money.
A11GYTUA9V741C B00IZLM8MY 5 1397952000 70 I have this on my iPad and have been waiting for this to come out on kindle forever. It is great! Just so you know, this isn't realistic at all. It I  still super fun. The quests can be annoying because you can have like ten that take your character, Julian, Payton, or Nishan. It's kind of annoying but still I love the game you should download. (I am 13)
A11GZ9L51UGR39 B0086700CM 5 1339200000 27 its so awesome its the real one like on the ipod and ipadI love it because you can purchase things in the store and it is awesome
A11GZ9L51UGR39 B004QJGPNM 3 1328486400 27 I got it and started playing it but its not all that fun all you do is showboat to the endzone using spin Jule and sprint moves
A11H4BGZ13HSHE B004X80QNG 4 1323648000 157 I don't know what the others are talking about when they ask for a widget. This is the first time that I am using this product and I absolutely love it. It is a more detailed task manager than the ones that come with my Motorola Atrix. But, I saw an issue. When I tried to see if I could create and edit events and tasks by connecting the phone to my pc, I would get a force close dialog box that keeps coming back, even if you press force close.One addition I think would be even greater, if you could create an emulator for the pc to provide quicker entry for appointments and tasks. I am a full time student and stay at home mom and I have a lot of deadlines and appointments to make at once. It takes too long to enter the data in. Otherwise, I love it! keep up the good work.
A11H4BGZ13HSHE B004MC8CA2 5 1325289600 24 I love the updates. I love the app too. Anywhere your phone goes,your bible does too. Love posting to fb also. Keep it up!
A11H5V1BNJKASQ B00529IOXO 1 1358812800 53 the update is fine, I like the new changes,  but it crashes more then it used too. and whenever my kindle swiches sides, it removes my text. messages are coming up as doubles or triples now! this update was nothing but Crap! how do I change it back? will they ever fix it?
A11H5V1BNJKASQ B008AVPMLI 5 1340496000 25 its dealt fun for just small action apps. lots of guns and upgrades. I cant put my kindle down....unless I run out of power :)
A11H5WNLMXHRPV B00BGDEK9C 5 1391731200 31 This is great you can have several players and my family likes bowling and we play it many times. I rate this game 5stars because it is so much fu bowling
A11H5WNLMXHRPV B00FATEJYE 5 1391731200 35 This game my little cousin loves playing this game and he could play it many times.You must like this kind of game. I rare this 5 stars because it is so much fun to play
A11H5WNLMXHRPV B00FAPF5U0 5 1391731200 25 This game is once you start you don't want to leave it.Everyone that plays it couldn't get over how you just want to keep going
A11H6S0AQI7HBF B006P2Y2QK 5 1394928000 25 This is another good way to spend our idle time when you have the need to relax for a while. I enjoy all card games.
A11H6S0AQI7HBF B0088Y7YHW 5 1394928000 23 Great pastime to have on your android pad to kill time when you have nothing better to do. I am a slot fan.
A11H6S0AQI7HBF B00HIFVID8 5 1405296000 2 Good Game
A11H6S0AQI7HBF B00FAPF5U0 5 1405296000 3 fun to play
A11H6S0AQI7HBF B00GMIB0O4 5 1405296000 3 Great pastime. Fantastic
A11H6S0AQI7HBF B00H2TEG7U 5 1405296000 2 Love solitare
A11H9QIWX9KQRP B00DQ8APIK 3 1377129600 52 Being from the good ole USA I thought this would be a rather simple game.  WRONG!!  Where did you get some of the logos?  Luckily the game gives hints up to and including solving the puzzle if you get really stumped.  I do wish that once solved the whole logo was revealed.
A11H9QIWX9KQRP B00DYY92MG 3 1376179200 42 The game could be fun but so few points are earned for correct guesses that you have no options but to purchase coins to get past the really obscure shows.  Good for the developers of the game, not so for the player.
A11H9QIWX9KQRP B00COVCV50 4 1374624000 31 Many of the puzzles are relatively easy while others are real brain traders.  The game is not as frustrating as others,  when you are forced to &quot;throw in the towel &quot;
A11HCEZ4DU3XKY B005V1N71W 1 1340409600 20 i thought it would have more design.not noly "Team Liam One Direction".if it said more i probably would've bought  it.
A11HCEZ4DU3XKY B00AE9UYJ4 5 1356566400 28 Ive been trying to purchase or download slender man on my kindle fire but all of the other games are just garbage!!! BUT this app is freaking awesome!!!
A11HCEZ4DU3XKY B004O9G750 5 1356307200 21 Im so addicted to this! I mean seriously, who doesn't??? I havent played a game like this since I was seven!
A11HCEZ4DU3XKY B004K56MNU 5 1358553600 21 I love to share my stories, and read other peoples stories!! I think the new update is sorta confusing though &gt;&hellip;&lt;
A11HCEZ4DU3XKY B007JMX27A 3 1343174400 27 i turned on my kindle off and when j turned it on on the notifacations it said that it was still playing and it was!!! please change!!
A11HCEZ4DU3XKY B008PPGFZG 1 1375401600 24 1 thing. I hate it.  It doesn't let you post pictures! You can easily post pics on iPods or ipads!!! DO NOT BUY APP
A11HDF7C4QIW5G B0069G5Z9K 4 1381622400 26 A very well designed game. I'm docking a star because some of the special vehicles get on my nerves, but otherwise, great game. Check it out.
A11HDF7C4QIW5G B00FELZD70 3 1381708800 38 It's a fun simple little game, but it constantly pesters with microtransactions and Facebook invitations. I like the random trading card power up system and the treasure chest keys are obtainable through gameplay rather than a premium currency.
A11HE8VLDP500V B00AKL1XPU 5 1372896000 22 Fun for all ages!! cute and fun! I love animals so this is great!! and all the different animals are so cool!
A11HE8VLDP500V B008GU42KK 5 1369699200 21 Really cool game!! I go to sleep with colors in my head!!! pass the time so quickly!! I love this game!!
A11HE8VLDP500V B00B2TET3C 5 1367107200 24 Bingo Beach is NUMBER 1!! relaxing Sunday fun!!! fun for any day! any time!! wishing to play it more but I gotta work!! lol
A11HE8VLDP500V B006MH1A1S 5 1339200000 21 Love this game!!!!! Totally fun!!! Good practice toward paying attention in real life!!! Cant wait to get the full on version!
A11HE8VLDP500V B008H4MVRG 5 1356998400 21 Really cute game! Animal lovers, young and old, will love this game! Lots of animals, and the interaction is sweet! A+
A11HE8VLDP500V B00AKKTDJY 5 1367712000 21 I love playing all the Flo diner games! They are so fun!! Gotta fight my daughter over who plays more!!! Lol
A11HE8VLDP500V B00AEWUQG2 5 1357862400 29 this is fun game. I enjoy learning again the things I have forgotten!!! my nephew is five a gets more correct with guessing than I do by thinking lol
A11HKGCCW5PNYW B004MNUQAU 5 1318291200 42 holy crap you mean I can't download real Mimi horse and cash out real money?  what a rip!  sorry, he's a moron amazon should require you to have a brain before allowing you to review anything. 5 stars to offset an idiot
A11HO325CAQFTG B00FX6ZBXC 5 1396137600 22 LOVE THIS GAME! WHAT A CHALLENGE LEARNING NEW WORDS....LOTS OF DIFFERENT SKILL LEVELS....ANIMATION AND SOUNDS ARE SO MUCH FUNRANDOM &#34;CHUMS&#34; ARE GREAT
A11HO325CAQFTG B00BUR9KJE 5 1375747200 18 The female's version of poker.Easy to play with several players or with just a few.A good traveling game.
A11HO325CAQFTG B0096DFY5S 4 1391904000 20 VERY CHALLENGING TO TRY FOR &#34;3 STARS&#34;.....NEW AND DIFFERENT DIAGRAMS TO TRY....GOOD TO OPEN &#34;FULL VERSIONS&#34; OF EACH GAME....INTERESTING FUN
A11HO325CAQFTG B00CB8JY9M 5 1375747200 22 Very addictive! Thrilling...taking chances on that next roll....easy to play anywhereAs much fun as BUNCO but without the need for 12 players.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B0097EWK3A 4 1350259200 35 Already looking forward to the next one!Didnt stop playing til I finished! Definitely worth $1.99! Great mystery game and cant complain because I thought it was free. That is the reason I found this app.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B008CG839O 4 1353715200 30 Loved this game and the idea behind it but eventually you have to spend money. I would rather pay a couple of bucks up front than have to spend money.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B00ED4TX2A 4 1382054400 31 So far I am enjoying playing the game. I like the stardom games so I am giving it a shot. Will up date my review once I'm finished playing the game.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B006GIX2MI 5 1389225600 29 LOVE THIS GAME! I am on my second time playing this game all the way through. It is worth every penny for the hours upon hours of game play.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B00IEBE7GK 5 1403913600 25 The Room Two is even better than the first. Great creepy music and storyline. Worth the price unlike a lot of the games out there.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B00BLS2U6M 5 1381968000 37 Yes I did end up spending money but I was addicted for 6 months! I was obsessed and think that the money I spent was worth it. The hardest part of this game is putting it down!
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B008BM3TKM 3 1353369600 45 I liked that the game wasnt based solely on HO and had different types of puzzles. I should have loved this game but found myself bored by the story line. As usual the graphics were great but didnt enjoy it nearly as much as others.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B00E0TK5G6 4 1382054400 21 A good solid point and click with some HO. I enjoyed playing it and the price to unlock it was reasonable.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B007KPOZK4 5 1353542400 36 I love this game and became quite obsessed for about a month and a half. Highly entertaining and worth a try. You dont have to spend money at all to play but you will want to.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B006JNH7YY 1 1351123200 46 Had to update my review when I realized that I cant get the game to download the next chapter onto my kindle to keep playing. WANT MY MONEY BACK! Great game if it works but at this time dont buy if you have a Kindle Fire!!!!!
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B00C5HW022 5 1382227200 30 This game is a combination of point and click and HO with a good story. The bonus is the minute you think you have finished the game you aren't finished.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B004S2W37O 4 1336608000 33 Great for letting everyone know whats going on and when. It sends reminder texts to your family's phones about important dates and everyone can add to the grocery list or to do lists.
A11HT0YXA4TUX7 B00E6Z0THE 5 1381363200 44 At the end there was a hint that a sequel would come out and I can't wait. There are so few of this type of point and click adventure game where you collect needed items and solve puzzles without any pointless HO. LOVE IT!
A11HU0UKKZ28KT B00DRHY8EW 5 1378857600 22 I had a lot of fun doing this game. There were lots of great activities. The interactive play was really quite good.
A11HU0UKKZ28KT B0064X7B4A 4 1362009600 34 I wish that you could play with multiple people like four to one game. Otherwise I love this game it helps keep in touch with friendly competition. I also like the random opponent option.
A11HU0UKKZ28KT B00JVOJ5T8 5 1402358400 20 I'm no artist but this makes me feel like I am. I like that it has different levels of difficulty.
A11HU1VMOCFQJP B005URX4OC 3 1318377600 32 Okay game. One achievement unlock was when I grabbed a shotgun and it said &quot;whats rick power level?&quot; If thats not a tribute to Dragonball Z then I dont know what is
A11HU1VMOCFQJP B0052UZIFA 5 1306800000 27 75mb before and now after Moving to SD Card 700kb, don't be afraid of the size. I been waiting all month for this and now its free
A11HU1VMOCFQJP B005OC3AO2 5 1318204800 24 Really is a fun game. Only played thru a few levels. Gotta Love the worm. The bird cries when the level is failed lol
A11HU1VMOCFQJP B006XIR9KM 4 1334880000 47 Its a different take on the classic Match game. The different tiles come and go as you try to match one tile to another. Easy to understand but fun factor will vary from person to person. I will probably open a few times until an inevitable uninstall
A11HUUZYFYOFAC B009UX2YAC 5 1389484800 29 It's fun and very good for kids to enjoy  I think the real one of those things are a lot of money but in this game I love it
A11HUUZYFYOFAC B008JGSM6G 5 1389484800 21 I think that this is ok for a grown-up but challenging for the kids and up but I really like it
A11HUUZYFYOFAC B00CO6TOBY 5 1389484800 26 It's fun for every one and it gets tricky every level and you could earn coins for higher scores just think of how and you'll win
A11HVB9X1M153J B00CD3L8JY 5 1376179200 92 "Sight Words" was the 1st 22Learn app that we tried, well, the demo version was anyway. We liked it so much we decided to go ahead and buy the full version but Connor still spends most of his time on that xylophone; however, there are some nice mini-games in this Full version that really make it worth buying such as the mini-games with the flowers. All in all this app is really just about matching up shapes which is good for perception and it does it in a fun, colorful, entertaining way.
A11HVB9X1M153J B00C66F4PC 5 1384646400 98 Bubble School Adventure A to Z is another well made app, I have been going through a lot of 22Learn apps this week (For my Godson, Connor) and this one is nice. School Adventure is bright, the colors are crisp and the app induces an overall relaxed & cheerful tone for the user. Connor won't be able to play for a few months now so I will be checking out more 22Learn apps, if they are as good as this one I will definitely be buying them all for when Connor is older. I highly recommend this app.
A11HVB9X1M153J B00DSM7J2E 5 1376179200 139 I've been stalking 22Learn for about a week now and I love all of their games that I have bought so far and "Kids Vehicles 2: Amazing Ice Cream Truck Adventure" is just as good as the rest. This app teaches valuable skills such as counting with fun mini-games where you make a Cupcake for a customer, and then you have to count the correct amount of coins to put in the register for the Cupcake. There is a fun Mini-game where you get to drive the Ice Cream truck, it plays the awesome Ice Cream truck tune too. And there is another fun mini-game where you have to select the correct color ice cream to feed the people using an "Angry Birds" type Launch system to launch the Ice Cream.  This is another app I would highly recommend.
A11HWX089BO74Q B0088QGB7Y 5 1382140800 27 Cute game, lots of fun for everyone. There is a lot of stuff to do in this game. It is a must have for every Smurfs fan.
A11HYQ6B3XGX07 B0085P2Z6E 5 1355443200 47 I love hidden object games. I accept that there are limitations based on screen size. I'm having fun with it anyway. Pinch to zoom works except on find the difference puzzles. Cute story with well drawn graphics. I wish more hidden object games were this well rounded!
A11HYQ6B3XGX07 B00785P2QC 4 1353888000 57 Plays like other Virtual City games. Biggest drawback is the need for investment dollars. Fastest way to get some is to post activity to Facebook. However, my phone tells me it isn't Configured to post to Facebook, so I only get investment dollars when I level up. (slowly, because I can't complete some tasks without investment dollars!)
A11HZS19F37YNZ B00C7TAF3Y 5 1368748800 55 Very best game I've played. Keep me interested and really fun. Hard but not so hard you can't figure it out. The is always a help button but it doesn't just give the answer. I like that. I need some help sometimes but I never want the answer just given to me. Love this game!
A11HZS19F37YNZ B0097EWK3A 5 1368489600 31 Well done! Keep me interested. Was a little hard at first to understand what to do next but there was help when I needed it.  Looking forward to the next one.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B007HSP57Q 4 1331942400 89 I got this because it was the free app of the day and because it is Saint Patrick's Day.  I played it for about half an hour mainly to test it out.  It is fun and entertaining for a little while, but isn't involved enough to really hold your attention.  It is a good brain tease and some of the "differences" are pretty tricky.  If you are looking to pass some time, and don't mind the price, I recommend you try it out for some Saint Patrick's Day Fun.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B006MYTHH0 5 1328054400 44 This app is very simple and clean.  It does what is says it will, nothing more and nothing less.  I have no complaints.  If you want a way to pass some time, and enjoy Tic-Tac-Toe, then this is definitely a good app for you.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B004GJ6BY0 5 1383436800 53 This app is a lifesaver for people like me who spend a lot of time commuting. It works very well and is easy to use. I love that I can purchase content on both my computer, phone, and tablet, and have it available and synced between my devices. It is an excellent application.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B006WFM7U8 4 1335139200 28 This game is pretty simple, but is a unique enough design to be very enjoyable. I had a lot of fun playing it and found it pretty captivating.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B004RCUJ9E 5 1376697600 56 I've had the free version of this game for years from the Play store, and have really enjoyed it.  Now that the $.99 version is the FAOTD, I figured I would get that version to avoid the ads.  It is just as good as the free version, but without the annoying ads.I recommend this Checkers game.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B004Q3CJQ0 3 1311292800 151 This app is simple to use and does a good job.  My only concerns are that I wish it displayed a timer.  If leaving the flash on for more than 30 seconds can damage it, the app should have a 30 second timer.I like that it puts the battery meter on the app's screen so you can see how much you have left, and be reminded of how quickly the light is draining it.This app asks for a ridiculous number of permissions, considering that it is just turning the flash on, and displaying images on the screen.  Either they are turning your phone into a zombie, or they want control of so many resources to support the delivery of advertisements.  Maybe both.  Because of security concerns with this application, I deleted it and installed DroidLight.  It is simpler even than this one, and doesn't require any permissions beyond the camera light.
A11I1I9QLMAM1A B0067R8JNK 5 1322438400 93 This game is challenging but also a lot of fun. It works great on the Kindle Fire. A good brain workout.I agree with the reviewers who state that it has a tendency to use words that aren't really words, but it happens rarely enough to not ruin the game. The manufacturer should consider shrinking the dictionary to just dictionary words like people would use in playing Scrabble.I am not as upset about the size of this game as some reviewers are, because I imagine that most of that size is the dictionary file.
A11I47RIQXL2MD B0058VW36U 1 1377820800 75 How many of your reviews are for real? I downloaded this game and an ad popped up wanting me to buy coins.ugh! Also,read at the bottom of the page.this game wants access to your privacy.networks and that.developer's,you do not need private information from people for your games.what you need to do is rely on real feedback and not anything else.one very good piece of advice is please do not solicit 5 star reviews.that is bad.
A11I47RIQXL2MD B00A6F6DIW 5 1397088000 161 This is one of the finest games I've ever tried.Granted, I'm not good at it, but who cares? That's the challenge! One of the best things is no permissions. Sure, it has a slight bug, but I am betting that after all these good reviews,the developers will fix it. As for that person whose child was disappointed, who do you think you are? You sound like you think you're better than anyone else, but you're not! Get some help for yourself and your child. Maybe you should go back and edit your review. In all honesty, I 'm a picky person, but for a game as good as Tangled, I have nothing but praise for it. At least I am a truthful person. Super whoever, some of us don't like your review, but you ARE entitled to your opinion. As are the rest of us. Our GOOD reviews outweigh your silly little bad one. To simplify this, I LOVE this game!
A11I47RIQXL2MD B0061S0A64 5 1377475200 29 When I bought this, I wasn't'sure what to expect.turns out I enjoy it very much.l play to relieve stress.my grandchildren think it is great.we need more apps like this.
A11I47RIQXL2MD B009YEMW6S 1 1370908800 25 I'm sorry, did not care for this app.it did not have a lot of different coins like it said,only a 1dollar coin.got bored very fast.
A11I47RIQXL2MD B004DM1ZQY 1 1379894400 71 I really like backgammon,but not this.downloaded it,then turned off my WiFi to play.I immediately got an error screen.I checked permissions and it said external storage.then why wouldn't it play?if you have to be on line to play a game as a single player,then that's a red flag.you should be able to play against the computer off line.if you want multiplayer,then go on line if you want to risk your privacy.I won't.
A11I47RIQXL2MD B0061SLW7A 3 1368230400 24 I am tired of typing in sentences to my Speaktoit.Some one do something,or you'll get some bad reviews.I think it's kind of okay....I guess.
A11I47RIQXL2MD B00640UICA 2 1377129600 31 Well,the game was cute,but it just did not sit right. And what gives the developer the right to know about networks,locations and the like? I like my privacy,thank you very much!
A11I47RIQXL2MD B00HA8WNZ0 5 1397260800 57 Lyne is a very beautiful game, but I did understand a certain one star review. As we all know, this guy is a troller who's &amp;#34;daughter wants a midget&amp;#34;. I have played only an hour on this game and like out a lot already. I highly recommend Lyne to everyone who has a brain, excluding Superman 75.
A11I9MXQW42DTA B008910NAO 4 1357344000 125 I like this version of solitaire.  Not because of the Christmas theme even though it could be just plain cards because the little graphics on the cards are not that Christmasy.  If there were Christmas music or something than it would be different and nice.  Anyway, I like the features that the games has.  I like that it stacks the cards automatically for you even when you uncover them.  What I think is missing is that the cards are difficult to manually stack (what happen to the double click that other games have) also when an ace is uncovered at the beginning of the game it doesn't automatically get stacked.  Other than that, I like the game and enjoy playing it.  It is very addictive!
A11I9MXQW42DTA B00ABGEFWC 5 1357344000 31 Right now this is my daughter's favorite game!  She plays it all the time.  I am happy that it keeps her challenged and it was free, which is always a plus!
A11I9MXQW42DTA B00A11AN6O 5 1357344000 32 Even though I haven't used it yet.  I liked the fact that I have the extra storage to place my pictures in when I get the time to put them in it.
A11I9MXQW42DTA B00AQ8S0F8 3 1357344000 64 This was really just a teaser to purchase the full version of the games, Where's my water? and Where's my Perry?  It was a holiday theme version so more than 6 levels should have been available.  I love the Cut the Rope games more because they give more levels for free which make you want to purchase the full version when it comes available.
A11I9T56T4S88R B00B49Z8TY 1 1360627200 47 its not even worth getting. u do not have cute clothes, and there is no normal skin colors. it is NOTHING like style me girl&trade; at all! i know why its free, cuz it is boring and im sure u wont like it just one bit :(:(:(
A11I9T56T4S88R B007HGMVIE 5 1362873600 81 it is the best game ever! you should get it because it is a really entertaining game. you can expand its size and get any building you could ever think of. theres houses and businesses. you can add people by their ID and visit their cities. you also have a wall where you can send and recieve texts. so, if you get the game, add me scb3031 or just visit my city. my city is named bitty city. hope you enjoy!&hearts;&hearts;&hearts;
A11I9T56T4S88R B00ABGFFOO 2 1356825600 23 It will not install on the kindle fire!! It takes forever. if you want it for you kindle it just waste your time.
A11I9T56T4S88R B00A4O6NMG 5 1369008000 22 it is so fun! it involves a ton of music! i would really like  it if u got the game right now!
A11I9T56T4S88R B00CSR2J9I 5 1375228800 20 this game is like so fun and it is almost as popular as minecraft!!!! ^_^  &hearts;&hearts;&#9733;  i am so random!
A11I9T56T4S88R B00A7ICO7C 5 1364774400 19 i love it because i love to bake! i also love to design my bakery!  add me scb3031bye bye!
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B0066T8M1I 4 1325894400 25 works well on my LG optimus. graphics are smooth and is a great time killer when you are bored, also great for the nostalgic folks
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B004KAL2BC 3 1321142400 49 this app would be a lot better if it didn't take up so much memory.  I don't have multiple accounts and don't have any lists and I'm at almost 20 mb of memory. pretty ridiculous. if you don't have much memory on your phone I would skip this app
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B004SRLB1I 1 1301788800 36 I don't see how punching a cat in the face is funny. I would never pay for this apps I just checked it out since it was free. only small children would find this app funny.
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B006QZM73Q 1 1326758400 34 I have no idea why they say its not compatible with the lg optimus. I downloaded it without any problems. the only problem was that this app is slightly amusing for about 5 seconds.
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B005A89508 5 1317254400 73 I bought this app for when I get stuck, or when I'm getting my butt kicked in scrabble or wordsmith. it gives you a lot of different options for boards and words. also the dev responded really quickly when I emailed a question (I had no idea how to add blank tiles, turns out you only have to hit the space bar or put in * or ?  I highly recommend this app!
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B005K9V776 1 1323302400 20 really lame. if you know its not com patible then why don't you try to fix it? lame lame. lame
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B004XNPQUO 1 1330646400 21 not very fun. pretty boring. what's with all the free apps being non compatible with the optimus? anyways not worth it
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B004SBS8LA 4 1301702400 30 love this game! however it gets laggy after playing it for awhile. other than that it is so much fun to play and my cat likes the sound effects lol
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B0050D6PH4 3 1306368000 23 this game is very addicting. however it keeps force closing on me. I have an optimus v. will give 5 stars once fixed.
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B004MNO0BQ 4 1314144000 24 I would have given this app five stars but the two player mode is terrible and difficult to play will change review when fixed
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B007IUKQGS 1 1338508800 31 this game is really annoying, it needs work. if they gave actual hints to what the word is and if they gave you more guesses this would be a lot better
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B006HUWEHY 4 1325980800 31 I thought this game might be boring but since it was free I decided to try it and I'm now addicted to this game! great graphics,  lots of levels! LG optimus
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B005ZY5U2E 1 1323993600 23 good thing this app was free. it won't install, it keeps really starting my phone. very disappointed. hope they fix it.  Lg optimus
A11IB0F0Y82DP3 B00EEDJHXA 5 1387756800 51 I got this app during the free app of the day. Usually the free apps of the day are apps that are filled with spyware and get boring very quickly. This app doesn't have spyware and is very addicting! Its a great time killer and keeps your mind sharp! Highly recommended!
A11IBRMQDMV5EM B006OC2ANS 5 1335744000 38 I love this game it is the best game I ever played in amazon app market on first it was a glitches the I bought it again and it worked so u might wnt to get this game
A11IBRMQDMV5EM B0080IOHLW 5 1336953600 20 this is the best game ever it needs more pets like a unicorn,dinosaur,or a giant and it needs more buildings
A11IBRMQDMV5EM B008N8IV2U 5 1351555200 28 I beat this game so many times and it is still a good game I never get tired of it is so addicting my kids even love it
A11IBRMQDMV5EM B006D1ONE4 2 1329782400 23 if I were you I would not buy this game because it is lame unless you try the free version of the game.
A11IBRMQDMV5EM B0085N9I84 5 1338595200 32 this is the best game ever it is addicting and fun first I looked at the pictures and it looked fun so I downloaded it and now I cnt put it down
A11IDE76WBFTUZ B005HSL626 5 1344729600 29 I have a little brother and ie loves this game and so do I...  there are different modes In the game and it is very entertaining.  I recommend this
A11IDE76WBFTUZ B0086700CM 5 1344556800 26 this is a very good game! and its really easy. all u hav to do is swipe... I recommend this game for people who like adventure
A11IDE76WBFTUZ B005JT3YNC 3 1344729600 81 for me it stinks but for my little cousins and brother it entertains them. sometimes I will play it( I still have the app) depending if I'm bored or lazy or any other mood. but they need to fix the floating icing..... if they don't fix it soon I will delete it. but ive been trying to search for other cooking games but there is nothing. if anyone knows a game.....Pls tell me.  ;)  thank you so much for reading this..
A11IDE76WBFTUZ B009UX2YAC 4 1351900800 52 this was a very cool game. It reminded me of temple run, though. you basically run away from a subway person in the subway. in the beggining, all you have to do is dodge and jump and collect coins. but when your towards the middle, the trains start moving. I recommend this.
A11IDOQ8Q56Q4I B00D6SBOWG 4 1377388800 82 Love this game.  A lot of different card arrangements to keep you playing.  I gave it a 4 Because after you have played through the courses, you come upon the ones that require golf bucks.  If you haven't saved all you earned (and it is a lot,) and purchased clubs when needed, you only have enough to play a few of them.  I solved this problem by removing it from my device and reinstalling it for hour and hours of fun again.
A11IDOQ8Q56Q4I B00AVGGYNA 3 1381708800 23 I can't seem to earn enough power ups.  I've bought some but don't like too.  I love bingo and this app is fun
A11IDOQ8Q56Q4I B00JBNS6KS 5 1400284800 24 Wonderful game.  I used to play the computer version back in the day and really enjoyed it.  This one for kindle has brilliant colors.
A11IDOQ8Q56Q4I B00AMEFZ72 4 1388188800 20 This is a fun game.  I like how the bonuses do not have to be bought.  It plays well too.
A11IDOQ8Q56Q4I B00E5GJ7QS 5 1383177600 23 This bingo is very fun.  I like bingo a lot and this one is great.  I recommend it for anyone who likes bingo
A11IDP3X5U54VP B0064DBE9I 3 1337644800 24 well if you really play the piano then you.know this is a bad app that's why I am giving it only 2 two stars
A11IDP3X5U54VP B0089336YM 3 1356307200 34 you can acculy listen to things but when I was listening to one in michagan it sounded like there was a gun shot. and a roaring sound. it scared the crap out of me
A11IDP3X5U54VP B0050KDTSK 2 1348963200 24 plays music randomly and force close but turns on while kindle is off do not get it I had not problem with money though
A11IDP3X5U54VP B007JYI4SU 2 1337644800 37 I know its fake so why try to get people to download it. all you do is put your thumb on it and if you keep found it you can se the emotions go in a pattern
A11IDP3X5U54VP B00769WNK8 5 1337817600 20 this game is to fun I played it all night it is awesome on the kindle fire get it now
A11IDP3X5U54VP B004MC8CA2 5 1381622400 26 this is a very usefully app and I bring my tablet with me to church now!!! now I can finally read the Bible on the go
A11IDP3X5U54VP B00766HXAQ 5 1342051200 23 fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun play play it all day long fun game for baby's and little kids fun
A11IDP3X5U54VP B0061OACXO 5 1337644800 42 first off I do not know what you guys r calling blurry cause everything on my kindle fire is working good and YES you can change the Colorado of the nails unless you r blind I love this app so download it
A11IDP3X5U54VP B007Z4AKQI 5 1340236800 20 you can have hours and hours of fun on this game it is really fun and you should get it
A11IDP3X5U54VP B004SVMNXY 3 1337644800 27 download it and play it for 2 days but gets kinds boring. and its not the real classic. it could be fun to beat your record everyday
A11IDP3X5U54VP B007OX6DIY 1 1339977600 47 this game went through my kindles files and told me I had to download something which would. take up a whole bunch of space I am very unhappy with this game even though I have played it before on a iphone I would give it 0 stars
A11IDP3X5U54VP B004GYY714 2 1340064000 62 ok this is not a good app for a kindle fire! loads a lot and does not had very good sound quality. it would be fine if you had earphones pluges into it. and it also does not give a variety of stations. I prefer PANDORA which has good wound quaily and creates stations but just puting a artist or a song.
A11IDP3X5U54VP B0069G5Z9K 5 1345420800 24 I have been waiting forever for this game it has always been on apple devices it is so fun play it all day long
A11IDP3X5U54VP B007TXUZ1U 1 1337731200 25 first of all you have to but everything to do something with the baby and don't even get me started with the sounds it makes
A11IDP3X5U54VP B006HJKKCG 5 1337644800 29 now when I go to a different country I can say what I want to say with just a touch of a button and great on the kindle fire
A11IDP3X5U54VP B007U7BIO8 4 1345939200 35 I use it every morrning and if you r a deep sleep this is a.good app for you its super loud but when you turn off the alarm the next day it still goes off
A11IDP3X5U54VP B004SJ3AXI 5 1340064000 77 well I never had a problem with Rovio the creaters of angry bird which has become a big hit out of no where. Angry birds is a game for everyone. I have the whole family playing it. my mom has it on her iphone,my dad has it on his aneroid,I have it on my kindle fire,my brother has it on his iphone, and my little brother plays it with what ever he can put his hands on.
A11IDP3X5U54VP B0054JZC6E 5 1338595200 25 its really cool and all you have to do is press skip don't be lazy people just press it there also a lot offing games
A11IDP3X5U54VP B006OCM13M 1 1348963200 48 plays music out of nowhere. its bad when your in class with your kindle fire reading and music from the game just turns on and you get in troble. I have no problem with it stealing money though the only good game by team lava is fashion story
A11IDP3X5U54VP B008AYOLB2 1 1347235200 70 not very good song like songs with bad words. needs to put Christan music on here. also assayed says needs wy-ti even though I am connected to the Internet. it also does not load right. has lots of problems. messes up your device a lite and makes it slow and tresses it up. don't get it and thanks for reading this I review on most games so look for me
A11IDP3X5U54VP B007L3M1W4 1 1337644800 50 that's stupid the models are kinds ugly and fake looking like they r made out of wax but its fun for like 5 year Olds. sure plan what you will look like on your wedding day but I'm sure most people look way better the the people on this game
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004JJR2K4 5 1308355200 53 This is the best 10 bucks I've spent. It's saved me from the constant reliance of wi-fi networks and whatever else when I'm out and about. Cannot be happier with how simple it is to set up and use. I have it working on a Mac Pro and a Mac Book. Works perfectly.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B0050QV0RQ 5 1317340800 52 this is a simple to jump into throw away Rogan story. its not about the main characters feelings or struggle to come to grips with himself. its a surface level fun dog that you can play for 6 minutes here and there and enjoy. isn't that what a mobile app should be.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B0058VW36U 5 1310601600 41 Ever bought something and thought that despite your purchasing the item/content at the requested price, you still feel your ripping them off. That the deal was too good, that you should send them more money? this is a lot like that.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004SBX112 5 1308355200 29 This game keeps giving. You buy it now, and from then on it updates itself every major holiday, giving you another full length game.Very cool. Who else does that?
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004N2NWT2 5 1303344000 74 I like this game because it's not that nice. It gives you simply puzzles, it gives you a few chances to complete them and if you don't do it in that time frame it sends you back to go. While the game seems short, as I'm 50% done and have played for 10 minutes, it was a fun 10 minutes. And well worth my time. It's a dollar people, it doesn't break the bank.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004VFJMYK 5 1317081600 50 I used Runtastic and that was great, but this program covers many more topics. While it doesn't have a space for BJJ you can create a custom slot for it. The GPS feature with maps tied in, and MP3 player included in the program is fantastic. Easily worth the money.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004R13U6Y 5 1303689600 43 I'd like to go on an on about all the features, but simply put this little application opens up PDF's without any effort, and lets me read them. I can pinch and zoom and that's all that I care for it to do.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004W89LGU 2 1308355200 51 Perhaps I'm not giving this game much le-way. I played a level or two. Decided immediately that I wouldn't like to play it anymore, let along ever again. And that was that. However, I am certain my 9 year old Nephew would enjoy it. Anyone above that age. No. Probably not.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B0055S348W 5 1317081600 56 I got this app thinking that it would be the most amazing thing ever invented. The I hit a small snag setting it up. So I shelved it. Last night I attempted to use it again, printing out an email. Simple as can be. Unsure of the previous snag, but it works now. 21st century stuff!
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004R1LNGS 5 1301270400 154 While I haven't had to use it for it's intended purpose. I do think it's great that if I do misplace it, I can now locate it. Not so much as, "it's in the couch next to the empty bag of cheeto's, but it's on this street at this address. Which, if you really think about it. The fact that I paid 99 cents for a program that can find my cell phone, I should just be screaming at the sky that I can't believe it. As around 5 or 6 years ago we were all walking around with Nokia's that had monochrome green screens with black numbers. And now I can hunt my phone down, see recent calls and in the case of my phone being stolen, lock it or erase it. From someone other than the phone itself....I'll be outside screaming I can't believe this at the sky if anyone needs me.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004SBS8LA 5 1308355200 31 Although I am no longer obsessed with Angry birds, this was a very nice game while I did have that neurotic tick. I don't know anyone who doesn't enjoy this game.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004SCG69A 3 1303344000 68 While I can see why people would like this game, I personally don't. You don't chase tanks or run around a map. Instead your in a little square box, you inch into the next room just to shoot and not be shot back and presto. Level over. Controls were sorta strange, however there are many different options, so I did find a way that worked best for me.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004OZOTSQ 5 1317081600 50 While this may seem like a silly app, since you can plug your phone in and use it as a disk drive for free. It's actually very helpful to send files, whether they are song or pictures from anywhere in the house. Very quick download and upload speed as well.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B004OG7XY2 5 1363651200 25 the challenges levels are appropriate, the ability to review the entire game.is amazing. the adds are hardly notciable and in between games only. very fun.
A11IHV8N5A8IC7 B006PHD0RW 5 1329177600 37 I got this game today and played it for over an hour. its a fantastic spin on the Tetris idea. essentially. you stack items only you take into account weight and organization of the items. very entertaining.
A11IJK2G03MM05 B00992CF6W 5 1405296000 64 This is a wonderful app that keeps you busy without getting bored for loads of time!!! It also lets you connect to your friends when they come over to help build your world or for some fun! Worth-your-money game. This is an awesome app, except for the bug in the new update that keeps glitching . The app freezes, then closes itself. Please fix!!!
A11IKM5PHLB6BZ B00B63HT8Q 5 1374019200 32 It's simple to use and can carry several locations that you can then go to with just one click. The forecast is one click away. It beats sifting through the weather websites!
A11IKM5PHLB6BZ B0063IH60K 5 1376265600 24 This game has a few options. It plays closer to what you might play with real cards. A great deal at twice the price!
A11IN4JW7V164I B008YSWKLW 1 1358467200 24 I was looking for a word scramble game and this was one of the first I came upon.  Really don't like it at all.
A11IN4JW7V164I B0064X7B4A 5 1359936000 23 I Enjoy the back and forth exchange!  Keeps my mind. challenged!  Good competition between friends and family to keep us on our toes.
A11IN4JW7V164I B008XG1X18 5 1358467200 23 They have so many original ideas!  My girls love it too!  Gives us gift ideas, recipes and just helpful hints around the house!
A11IOO58JKA188 B0066T8OH0 2 1357603200 24 This game of Tetris is not as fun as if I was playing on a &#34;gameboy:. To much trouble to change the tile around.
A11IOSU711Z8C6 B004JZBGWI 5 1338336000 25 this app is awesome and free if ur a busy person then this is perfect for u u can plan out ur whole day etc.

A11IOSU711Z8C6 B006OBWGHO 5 1325894400 21 I love this game its awesome and free its challenging but not 2 hard a bunch of fun for everyone! !
A11IOSU711Z8C6 B005EUDHLU 4 1325980800 23 this game is preaty awesome its just like the my friends would do. I like how it turns it into a story! !
A11IOSU711Z8C6 B006QZM73Q 5 1327363200 28 this game is funish but don't play it 2 often or it will get boring I got it free but 99 cents is too much for  the game.
A11IOSU711Z8C6 B005KCQZ2K 4 1326585600 30 this game is and was very addicting the first week or so but after a while it gets old. but too bad you can't actually Do the pets hair! !!!!!!
A11IOSU711Z8C6 B005XQLBU4 3 1326585600 21 glitches. on. screen way slow not fun.  but its ok for a lil while. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! not fun not fun not fun
A11IOSU711Z8C6 B004ZALKMI 1 1325980800 28 this game is boring all he does is op en and close eyes the mic. doesn't even work on the kindle fire! ! id give it ZERO stars!!!!!!!
A11IPA8VOJTC3V B005LVLJP8 4 1396742400 47 Very competitive computer players. I play this in the car, at work and at home in my free time. It wasn't till I was playing for a few days that I have a partner to help and helps me. I usually play this game as a loner.
A11IR35H8RCL4I B009UX2YAC 5 1378425600 41 This game is giving my 3 yr. Old great hand eye coordination. I couldn't believe she knew how to play better than me!! And I'm good.lol would be interesting if you could level up different scenarios. Keep the great games coming!!
A11IR35H8RCL4I B008Y7SMQU 3 1370563200 25 I love to play the logo quiz games. This one could use better graphics. Other than that it's a good way to pass the time.
A11IR35H8RCL4I B00APKHA9Y 4 1378339200 24 When I first started this game I thought it was hard after a few levels, until I bought better guns. Then it became awesome.
A11IR35H8RCL4I B00E5GJ7QS 5 1385251200 27 I  just started playing this game today and so far this is the best game of bingo I've played yet. And I've just about played em all.
A11IR35H8RCL4I B00CX9P6V4 5 1374019200 21 This game is easy then just when you think your a pro gets really hard. I love the challenge......love love love
A11IR35H8RCL4I B00AMEFZ72 5 1383868800 29 This version of bingo is great to play if you don't have the money to shell out for more gold. Compared to other bingo games this one's the best.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00A8ECU24 4 1383782400 40 MLP is pretty fun things can be a little exspensive but its still a lot of fun to play.  the Minnie games help sometimes ..it also helps to try and save money, even if you do it for a while.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00CTQ6SIG 5 1383177600 55 so glad this is here on kindle! loved it on my smart phone but didn't like the smaller screen. this game is pretty addicting like everyone has said before me lol, I just wish that thing's didn't take so long to do, stuff was a little cheaper and that it was eaiser to get friend's.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00HFUNYWY 5 1391212800 27 I'm glad that this is finally on the kindle! I loved it on my phone, but like it better on here.  don't forget to add me :)
A11J12I56U3PQB B00KMX5V8G 5 1405814400 32 finally! on kindle, I've been waiting for this forever! finally no more tiny screen to look at and I can finally say goodbye! to candy crush, really got tired of that game.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00BLS2U6M 5 1383696000 59 I love this app, I love that it's on the kindle! I played this alot on my phone and loved it. it's so addicting and so much better than it's older brother. if you loved the first one, you'll love this one.  it's also great that it's on a bigger screen than a small screen like a smart phone.
A11J12I56U3PQB B008CG839O 4 1383696000 25 not sure how this differs from top girl, but both are pretty fun and really laggy. plus they game play is pretty much the same.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00IYAG7DM 4 1399334400 32 its a good game,  has an interesting twist to card playing games.  I love the way it makes your characters look how they do on the card, when doing quests and stuff.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00FMRWEAA 5 1381708800 72 I'm so glad that this version of star girl is finally on kindle! I love playing this on my smartphone and now that this is on the kindle now I can spend even more time playing it.  my opinion is that users of the other star girl game should make this version the main one you play because it has the fashion competition on it where as the other version does not.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00BHEUT0E 1 1381104000 36 I'm not even going to waste my time downloading this. what with all the horrible reviews about adware? shame on Amazon for letting this happen ..too bad it seemed like a good game from the description.
A11J12I56U3PQB B00AE6SS5O 4 1386979200 57 like most nevosof games its a good hidden object game. the story lines tend to be a little drawn out, in this one I felt it was going off point in the story and jumping from one subject to another too fast.  but it was a good game over all! different and fun game for Christmas themed.
A11J29FFUW9GTL B00ABGEFWC 5 1389398400 22 I love this game cause it is really fun and my favorite animals are the dancing horses the zebras and the horses
A11J29FFUW9GTL B00CTXY8RC 5 1390694400 24 I like world of cubes but whoever made the game needs to make more awsome updates and make the game a little more cooler
A11J3Q5DJG7Q1R B00CKW6FVE 5 1373241600 35 this game is a lot of fun. it takes me back to the days of playing it for hours on the nes. love it only reason it got 5 stars os cause there isn't 10
A11J3Q5DJG7Q1R B007TNS6JI 5 1346112000 52 this one awesome game. I have killed hundreds of hours playing. it gets a little repeditive however the level ups are nice and it does get pricey if you buy gem packs. I just wish it were a little easier to earn gems instead of having to buy them. love it though.
A11J6YLV9ZLLZ5 B0094BB4TW 5 1363305600 25 no better way to stay caught up with your friends on FB, easy to use, a good app. could use some tweaks but overall solid.
A11J6YLV9ZLLZ5 B004ZFK600 5 1396828800 50 this is hands down the BEST texting app available! I have SMS on my phone but sometimes when I am parked in my recliner and don't want to get up and get my phone I just text right from my Kindle Fire HDX. Buy this app, you won't be disappointed!
A11JCD71BTBLVI B005ZXWMUS 5 1334188800 165 My husband and I recently bought 7" android tablet/readers. We already had an account with Netflix and loved being able to watch movies or old TV shows on our TV. When we found the Netflix app on Amazon, we each downloaded it to our tablets to try it. What a great app! I love watching old TV shows and am a movie nut so this little app is perfect for me! In fact, I sat outside on the porch swing the other night and watched a couple of episodes from an old TV show that was always a favorite of mine. When there is nothing I want to watch on TV, I just use this app to find something I want to watch on my tablet. This is going to be perfect to use this summer when the season is over and the reruns start and there is NOTHING worth watching on TV! I really love this app and would recommend it highly to anyone!
A11JCD71BTBLVI B0063IH60K 5 1364947200 25 Fun game to play to pass the time. Nice graphics and choices for playing. Great app for those whole like android games on their tablet.
A11JCD71BTBLVI B004VOJT0I 5 1334188800 212 This app was a download from Amazon and I decided to put it on my little 7" tablet. I use the Allrecipes site all the time on my desktop when I need to find a recipe that I want to print out. I love to cook and am always looking for recipes! I thought this app for my tablet would be a really good thing to have. In fact, I used it the other night when I found a recipe I wanted to cook and took the tablet to the kitchen and read the recipe right from there. Although the spinner feature doesn't work on my tablet when I shake it (this must work on smart phones only), I can still go into the search box to find recipes that I need and it will come up with quite a few with the same name. I can always find one that I like!This is going to be a great app when we are on vacation or out of town and I want to cook something quick and easy. I can use this app on my little tablet to find most any recipe I need and have it right at my fingertips. If you love to cook, this is the app for you!
A11JCD71BTBLVI B004GYY714 5 1334188800 104 I found this app on Amazon and thought it would be great to have on my 7" android tablet. The selection of music is fantastic and I love the fact that I can just relax and listen to the radio or do other things on my tablet while I listen to my favorite music. I like the fact that you can preset your favorite stations so there is no searching around trying to find them again. The variety of radio stations is really good ... there is something for everyone! If you like to listen to the radio, this is the app for you!
A11JH14J684VK4 B00AIUUXHC 5 1368835200 77 This game is so much fun!  You can swim through caverns and find special artifacts and the best part is the hunting!  You can evolve your shark to eat bigger prey, like manta rays, hammerhead sharks, puffer fish, & lion fish.  You can jump out of the water to grab sea gulls, jump onto boats and grab fisherman, or jump onto docks and beaches and grab the people!  I love playing this game every chance I get!
A11JH14J684VK4 B006OBWGHO 4 1368835200 62 This game is really great for kids and grown-ups alike.  It makes you reason out how to get all of the rubber ducks and get the fresh water to Swampy.  My best advice though is to pay for the full version.  The free version only lets you go through 1 level and there is much more fun to be had than that!
A11JH14J684VK4 B005ZXWMUS 5 1373414400 38 I love having this app on my phone!  I can easily add movies to my queue and browse everything they have available for instant streaming.  I haven't encountered any issues, so I definitely give a big thumbs up!
A11JMGF896YBMU B007JPG04E 5 1332633600 28 I Love this game it is awesome but it might mess up your kindel fire but it is really awesome game that is what my brother thinks too.
A11JMGF896YBMU B004SJ3BCI 5 1334966400 61 I have never heard of angry birds but my dad told me it and now I love angry birds, angry birds seasons, and also angry birds space just to remember I love angry birds for my hole life so you better play angry birds because you are going to love it even on your kindle fire because it is very fun.
A11JMGF896YBMU B007XKEZ7O 5 1335484800 25 I love this game I found if just now if you have not got this than you should bye it because it is very fun
A11JNONMEB5T2H B00AKL1XPU 2 1357948800 23 thought my grandson would like it, but it had pop ups asking to purchase options, too easy to spend money, I deleted it.
A11JNONMEB5T2H B0094BB4TW 5 1357948800 24 I already use FB via my mobile or desk PC, but it is handy to to be able to use facebook via my Kindle.
A11JNONMEB5T2H B007KOKIK6 5 1357948800 21 Seems like a good learning game, and easy for my 4 year old grandson to navigate.  Haven't had it that long.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00CHSPB8Y 3 1389312000 22 I like like playing this game and it's free but once again if you want to move forward you have to pay.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00AKKTDJY 4 1369440000 20 Always love this game I like how it has the expanded version so you can play all parts of Dash.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00CKW6FVE 5 1376697600 23 Love that I get to challenge me friends and play online. Also will connect to Facebook so you can play against your friends.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B009UX2YAC 5 1377561600 24 Love playing this game the only problem I have is that your information doesn't carryover to the other systems you have to start over.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00FAPF5U0 5 1386720000 21 Love this game since day 1 glad it's on Kindle more chances to play. Awesome more pwople should play and challenges
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00A4KVFLY 5 1367193600 21 Let's me compete against my friends and help them out with the fast money rounds. Also like competing against other players.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00BMW6ER8 2 1389312000 38 I love playing bingo but this one makes it hard to get a bingo and the coins to keep playing go really fast. You can only play for about 30 m8ns depending on how many coins you have.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00AF6MF9I 2 1404518400 22 It started fun but as you move up in levels it becomes more harder to advance and get the stuff you need.
A11JNPTXJ6ERGD B00CWKYUSE 1 1389312000 27 This game is free but you have to play to go to the next round. You can only play one game and then it's asking for money.
A11JRWW7MTYFL7 B0052AZJV8 5 1326931200 23 works great. using it on my kindle fire for facebook, aim, Yahoo, skype, and google. no real problems and easy to set up.
A11JRWW7MTYFL7 B00A8ECU24 4 1354752000 31 at first I was like, &quot;meh. &quot; but now I can't put it down. Brony officially addicted. if you love ponies then give it a try, it is free after all.
A11JRWW7MTYFL7 B007PTJOV0 5 1334620800 24 has the basic Mario look and feel, but with original levels. grat fun, clean graphics, and free. really enjoying it o. my Kindle Fire.
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B0073LHCCS 5 1373846400 36 This app is starting to take the place of working my crossword puzzle in the morning. Fun way to activate my old brain.....cup of coffee and the Brain Gems game and I'm ready for the day!
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B00EBQRSTK 3 1376784000 29 Waaaaaay  too much advertising. This game is enjoyable to play and involve the kids in guessing words and spelling them but you're constantly dealing with the pop up advertising!
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B009LGKCS4 5 1353110400 43 the whole family can get involved depending on the age group and level you want to play....I was surprised at the word association my younger grandchildren were catching on to ....our whole family loves word games and this one is perfect for everyone...
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B00C7TAF3Y 5 1369958400 33 How refreshing to find a game that doesn't insult your intelligence, isn't monotonous, not wanting the game to end and wondering if this company makes any other games. I want more...I want more!
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B00FOW265Q 5 1384128000 48 Good old fashion fun! Even my grand kids got a kick out of this one. Imagine using your brain and having fun at the same time.....wonders never cease....seriously.....I love when they enjoy playing a game and actually learn something at the same time, thank you for your thoughtfulness.
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B0097HTPE4 5 1353283200 22 what fun! exercise your brain while you're relaxing and having fun.....doesn't get any better than that, right?! several games rolled into one
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B00AZOSBTI 4 1363737600 87 There doesn't seem to be a happy medium in the reviews....you either really like it or you only give it one star...hey it's free as in you don't have to pay for it! You buy the hints only if you are too lazy to figure out the solution.The game isn't brain surgery but it makes you think...heaven forbid you should have to use your intelligence for a few minutes instead of having an instant answer at your finger tips...lighten up, have fun, it's a game after all....
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B006VW94HQ 5 1353628800 34 once you start playing you have a hard time putting it down....I'll do just one more list......an hour later.....you'll still be saying, just one more list! If you love words, you'll love this game.
A11JU68ALNNZTZ B00AA87JGU 4 1384560000 46 It's not one of the mindless apps where boredom sets in within 5 minutes. This one makes you think although you have to get into it for awhile before it gets challenging but by then the first few challenges prep you for what's coming up....good work!
A11JX643QPEL7C B00A3E2BVE 5 1369094400 26 I love this app! It kind of reminds me of the old show &#34;Name that Tune&#34;. I am having a great time playing with my friends.
A11JX643QPEL7C B00AMR1HZ8 3 1369094400 23 I really like Wheel of Fortune and watch it just about every night. This app is okay but I really miss Vanna White.
A11JYYUEGTFIRB B00HHBXYGM 2 1399420800 21 Started out as a fun game until about level 30 and then they want money.  Plan to delete this game today.
A11JYYUEGTFIRB B00ESNW58K 2 1398038400 53 This game is all about money.  Unlike some of the other games that allow casual play before requiring money to move on, this one hits you right in the beginning.  I will probably delete this game today as the fun has been removed and been replaced with frustration.Too bad!  Could've been a winner!
A11JYYUEGTFIRB B00BWBHIUG 3 1405728000 115 Started out as fun.  Great game for all ages including adults.  BUT------this could be a perfect game if they would make a small change.  I am on level 43 and keep receiving instructions to grow all these rare plants and for the past 20 levels I can only grow 3 different rare plants.  If I see that big shell one more time, I will scream.  There is also a request to keep growing all these plants but there's no room to put anything.  They need to make more reef expansions.  I hope someone that designs this game reads some of the negative reviews and changes just a few things.  I am beginning to lose interest.
A11JYYUEGTFIRB B00KWVZ750 1 1404172800 25 Not really my &#34;thing&#34;.  Didn't find this game entertaining and already deleted it.  I'm sure if you are into Angry Birds, this might be fun.
A11K0CVIEM4W2P B007Q3KX42 1 1349827200 29 my little girl played this game and she could not buy them all seeing their sad little faces made her cry and cry she saw them disappear and cried
A11K0CVIEM4W2P B0050KDTSK 3 1350518400 32 It's ok I guess. We all have our favorites I for one think that it gets boring very quickly. My farm seems like &quot;getting old&quot; that's cause I don't work with it
A11K0CVIEM4W2P B00A4EZ3QS 5 1364860800 34 I love candy swipe! It is my favorite game on my kindle fire. It keeps me calm and also gives me a challenge. I would recommend this app for all ages. BUY THIS APP!!!!!
A11K0GY2TS9XL9 B005V20JKI 2 1328832000 32 For a game that depends on so much grinding, it's a pretty horrible move to not save player progress between updates. It was fun before the update, now it's time to uninstall.
A11K12M58H0RT B009LFGG76 5 1405296000 2 FUN Game
A11K12M58H0RT B007NZV2HK 5 1405296000 2 Challenging game
A11K15Q69ZLKJO B0058VW36U 5 1377993600 24 My favorite game my brother used to play it and for Christmas I got a Kindle and this was the first game I downloaded
A11K15Q69ZLKJO B00998UF9U 4 1399420800 31 I love this game so much,it has a few glitches but who cares! It is so much fun I wish there were more affordable clothes but other wise it's very fun.

A11K15Q69ZLKJO B00G5LQ5MU 4 1390089600 23 This is a really good game it is fun challenging and I just got this game today I haven't gotten that far yet
A11K430PSGRN80 B0098LBZPG 5 1350086400 33 THIS IS A VERY FUN GAME TO PLAY LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I'M AT WORK. AND MY KIDS LOVE TO PLAY IT ALSO WHEN THEY HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO AROUND THE HOUSE.
A11K430PSGRN80 B009ZS2B28 5 1355097600 22 I really love this game. and I really recommend this game to people to play.so everyone go out and purchase this game.
A11K430PSGRN80 B008JJS6D2 5 1347753600 22 everyone who play this game will love it so much. if you don't love it you don't know what u are missing.
A11K476LQ2LHNS B0065AFQSU 5 1381104000 28 Keeps me in touch with all my favorite teams and up to date on Sport news. Like the format, do not have to search all over the web.
A11K476LQ2LHNS B008RA3X5E 5 1381104000 20 Used it for wake up while on business, worked great. Love the different faces I can use, and light levels.
A11K476LQ2LHNS B008Y31CXE 3 1381104000 21 I have not used it enough to pass true evaluation on it. I still have to use it to further extent.
A11K68H1U95MOA B004R7L4JS 3 1359849600 29 The games are not like &#34;playing games&#34; like I kept hearing. The directions to some of the games are not very clear making it hard to play. Will delete.
A11K68H1U95MOA B007SYWFRM 5 1335830400 27 click stuff then settings then the arrow will come up. you do not have to shut down ur kindle. great app my 4 yr old loves it!
A11K68H1U95MOA B006BDHAX0 5 1359849600 38 This is a great time passing game. Its timed and the faster you clear the board of tiles the more stars you will recieve. You also get trophies on your accomplishments. I would recommend this game to anyone.
A11K68H1U95MOA B007PW1BZY 4 1356652800 30 Works good on my kindle fire. the only thing id like to see is a speed option. the opponent draws to fast and you cant see what they are needing.
A11K68H1U95MOA B005HSL626 4 1371340800 25 My kids (5 and 2.5) love it! Keeps the entertained when needed. I play I when I'm on lunch to help pass the hour buy.
A11KAWX314CFEX B00846GKTW 5 1366502400 20 I love this game it is the best I have played so far I think anyone would would love it
A11KAWX314CFEX B008N8IV2U 4 1344038400 25 I am stuck on the 5 th level I don't like ladders what do I do I don't know what to do its soooooooo hard
A11KAWX314CFEX B007PT3QOQ 5 1334707200 29 I love this game. I love this game this is the best game ever if u have ever played frontilville on facebook and like it u will like this
A11KAWX314CFEX B004DPCSKI 5 1329696000 41 I think this is so cool people say my school is hunted so I'm going to go arround the so called hunted auditorium and see if it delly is or if they are just trying to scare me Wish me luck!
A11KAWX314CFEX B0054JZC6E 5 1327449600 41 please excuse my spelling I'm only 10.I think this is the very very very great its the best game ever I had a full battery and when I quit playing it was nearly empty and I have a 6hour battery !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A11KCRBUM9GSBA B00C787O48 1 1376265600 81 I'm pretty sure that copying someone else's copyrighted material without permission is illegal. The people who made this game obviously have no intention of being original in any way. Along with Super Pepe`s World (their carbon copy of Super Mario Bros), TangoSoft deserves to be completely shut down. You can't just copy someone else's work and get away with it; you've known that since grade school. Anyone who actually gave this game a positive review should be greatly ashamed of themselves.
A11KCRBUM9GSBA B00CTQ6SIG 3 1388880000 70 This is a pretty good game. I have it on my iPod, and I used to play it on my Kindle.The reason I say &quot;used to&quot; is because one day, it needed an update. Naturally, I installed it. Then I came back the next day and guess what?The game started over. Everything I'd done was gone, and I didn't know why. So I deleted it.Would've given it four stars otherwise.
A11KCRBUM9GSBA B0069G5Z9K 5 1376352000 38 If I told you everything Halfbrick did right with this game, this review would literally go on forever. Just trust me when I say that this game is a must-play, and there's no reason not to play it.
A11KCRBUM9GSBA B00B7Y0206 3 1400112000 114 Well, this marks the end of my search for a working YouTube app. I give 3 stars for two reasons: it lets you watch videos in high quality like it promises, and it isn't crashing every time you open it. It's listening in the background that I have a problem with. I've tried multiple times to do that, but the app strangely keeps stopping midway through the video. What's the point of adding extra features if they don't work?Another problem, although less important: You can't go to people's channels. You've got to search entirely by video, so good luck finding anything you don't remember the name of, but you do know who uploaded it.
A11KCRBUM9GSBA B00FAPF5U0 1 1388880000 180 Where do I begin?King was absolutely shameful in its marketing tactics for this game. Just like EA, Candy Crush runs on the idea of &quot;free-to-play equals pay-to-win&quot;. Actually, scratch that, because this game isn't even free to play. The levels are designed to be almost impossible, so as to convince you to either A) spam your friends' Facebook accounts with requests for power-ups or extra lives, or B) spend money to be able to win. I've seen my mom play this game, and she's had to retry certain levels more times than she would've bothered to count. Also, at certain points in the game, you get locked out for three days until you either pass the daily challenges (which are just previous levels that you've already beaten) or --surprise, surprise-- buy the privilege to continue onwards. I feel sorry for all the ladies who ruined their credit cards, and their online reputations, by playing this piece of crap. Never before have the limits of human greed been pushed this far.Oh, and as a bonus, it's a shameless ripoff of Bejeweled.
A11KGDQSEHWF52 B0088QGB7Y 5 1345161600 20 I love this game ever on should get it I think that amoze did a good job doing this game

A11KGOMI5TKVU9 B00992CF6W 5 1391040000 20 This game became my favorite game after playing it! In this game you can be a survivor or a creator.
A11KGZ5ANVI8PS B0064DBE9I 5 1370822400 20 this is my first review! I love playing the piano; so I decided to download this! I highly recommend it!
A11KGZ5ANVI8PS B00D57N4O4 5 1370822400 21 I Love Bingo games; this is perhaps the best bingo game out there! I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoysbingo!
A11KGZ5ANVI8PS B0069G5Z9K 5 1370822400 20 hafbrick studios have done another awesome game!this is way cooler than fruit ninja; try it out for yourself and see:)
A11KHDINAFLDC7 B0064X7B4A 5 1357344000 27 I'm liking this because I always like the board game, Scrabble.  I have several friends I play with.  With one friend, I play up to 10 games.
A11KHSA6UOPXLS B00FX6ZBXC 5 1393372800 20 I love playing this game. It really gives my mind a good challenge.  I enjoy trying to beat the computer!
A11KHSA6UOPXLS B0094BB4TW 5 1386201600 26 I love being able to get onto my facebook on my kindle by one touch!  I use it daily. I stay logged in all the time.
A11KHSA6UOPXLS B004TTY694 4 1386201600 30 I use my notepad frequently. I keep my grocery list on there, and then it's handy in the store! Just don't forget the kindle at home when you're shopping! :-)
A11KIGPVZPQD9X B00APKHA9Y 2 1357344000 24 I hate how every gun ethier costs money or takes a long time to get. If they tweaked these things it would be great.
A11KIGPVZPQD9X B007JMX27A 5 1357344000 31 I love this app. Its better than pandora by a long shot. I love how you can choose what artists are are on you're  station. Keep up the good work Jango!
A11KJ1BT95Q01I B00AREIAI8 5 1370995200 33 It teaches responsibility, and and how to care fore a horse if you like horses. I also like horses cause I they are so cute and lovable. In all I like this product.
A11KJ1BT95Q01I B00FHYX6O6 4 1386892800 24 This is such a fun game if your a cookie lover you'll want this awsome game wow wow and certain cookies give yo more
A11KJ1BT95Q01I B00CH87HF4 5 1398384000 33 Awesomeness is all I have for this game. If you like fighting and medieval you will love this game. The only down side is that it is hard to aim with the archer.
A11KJ1BT95Q01I B00BBMQXLG 5 1388102400 35 The pictures don't lie about the game the pics are what got me playing this gory product. I wouldn't recommend this product for younger kids 4-8 it's very gruesome the ways you kill you opponents.
A11KJ1BT95Q01I B00H0BGCJK 4 1388275200 23 This is such a good game I am starting to question whether it shouldn't have been free or if it should remain free
A11KMHPW9U36M9 B009UX2YAC 5 1360368000 21 I love this game it Is so fun I'm 12 and I love this game so much I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!
A11KMHPW9U36M9 B007VUA7VO 5 1396224000 21 ive had this app for a while and love because I can know what the REAL percent is at all time!
A11KMHPW9U36M9 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1391817600 34 It is a really good game. the game is great for kids. it is easier than flappy bird because the pipes are larger so it enables kids as young as 3 to play it
A11KMHPW9U36M9 B00FHYX6O6 5 1386028800 21 its so addicting to use this app. when I'm in school I cant hold myself back.  I just love this app.
A11KMNSLDIQTI4 B00BMH4GQE 4 1365724800 23 Really a good game to play on rainy days! It really makes you focus on the pictures to find the one common word
A11KMNSLDIQTI4 B00C6RHC1A 4 1367020800 22 I am truly addicted I play this game all day at work,I ask for help from everyone who walks in the office.
A11KMNSLDIQTI4 B00BNH1PF8 3 1364256000 28 This game is fun but  when you get stuck your stuck....especially if you don't have coins!!!!!  It would be more enjoyable if you could even scramble the letters
A11KSL0QTRFJYJ B00529IOXO 5 1326153600 76 its simple, make ur profile add ur contacts and BAM! u have yourself a 2nd hand cell fone. its really fun 2 use.and its kinda lil facebook but instead u write 2 the peeps in ur contacts and it is really like a cell fone. I think its really kool 2 have a device that is big and isn't meant 2 txt on..2 actually txt on it..and the steps 2 getting it ready is woo easy.
A11KSL0QTRFJYJ B0066HA1A0 5 1325289600 23 this game is a good one. once u start playing it, u get hooked on it I ended up buying the real version
A11KSL0QTRFJYJ B008Y7SMQU 5 1357430400 26 this a good game. be careful not to get addicted to the fun game. hahahahahahahaha this an awesome game. you get hooked on it soooo fast.
A11KSL0QTRFJYJ B006RAX9OQ 3 1325203200 27 I thought this game was gonna be boring but it turned out to be a decent game so u should get it its worth the free price
A11KU7ZFXUC9J4 B00G4A6VZS 4 1390262400 92 I enjoy Stack the States very much, and was delighted to see this version. What I DON'T like is the size of the relative countries, in particular, the largest ones. Russia is the largest country, yet shows smaller than the next three or four.I'm sure it's difficult to get proportions correct - as very tiny countries like Andorra need to be included. But Russia is just jarring when it appears.It's a great game to learn facts about the world. I'm ashamed to say that, for me, Africa is still largely uncharted territory............
A11KU7ZFXUC9J4 B00E8KLWB4 1 1390262400 61 I normally do not get games of this type, but it looked interesting. Installed it, started to play, and almost immediately, my Kindle locked up.I have not gone back. The graphics were great, but I wear reading glasses, and really cannot see some of the detail. The 'freeze' might have been something that I did, but I'll stay with other games.
A11KU7ZFXUC9J4 B00JV858HM 1 1404950400 74 This is the first app that I've downloaded that requires me to enter my Amazon account password separately into the app to purchase additional items in the game, even with Amazon coins. Another game by this maker, downloaded at the same time, requires the same thing.Since I'm very hesitant about doing this, rather than using the coins (or 1-click),  I give it only 1 star. Too bad, as the free games were quite entertaining.
A11KWTZ5Y9WPAJ B00A3WTXQ2 5 1376524800 23 This game is so much fun to play. Doodle Jump is totally ripping you off. Happy Jump is so a 5 star game.
A11KWTZ5Y9WPAJ B00AM1RL4A 5 1359936000 23 I love this game. It's challenging and fun. I could play it for hours!I think that when it's free. People will buy it.
A11KWTZ5Y9WPAJ B0090WZZ9A 1 1359763200 21 This game is cheap and violent. Don't get it for your kids. It has death and damage.Never get it at all!!!
A11KWTZ5Y9WPAJ B0086700CM 5 1359936000 22 Great idea. I think that it's my favourite app.Also temple run 2 is a fun game too.It's challenging and fun.Who's with me?
A11KY2RNLKCX7H B00GP0G0IK 5 1388016000 47 Great story, great-looking graphics. The map is very helpful, but not *too* helpful (which is great because too easy = no fun). I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves point and click adventures that require you to think a bit to solve them. Thanks, G5!
A11KY2RNLKCX7H B00FN7K8Z2 5 1389398400 73 With the right mix of adventure and HO. I found this game to be very engaging. I only have time to play in short stints and the game lasted my about a week and a half, and then I got another week out of the Bonus Chapter, which in itself could be a standalone game!! Just brilliant! I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys adventure, mystery and a bit of HO.
A11KY2RNLKCX7H B006OOHYIC 5 1332547200 23 i love this app it is so beautiful and relaxing. both quell apps are qreat for both me and my 6 year old.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B005V1N71W 4 1379894400 93 Pandora is very easy to use and users have access to a fantastic selection of stations, music, etc.  And it can be used even when local radio stations close down for the night.  Sound quality, going through my Kindle Fire HD, is easily comparable to a good quality portable FM Radio.Still, I do not expect to use it very much.  I mostly use my Kindle at home and I prefer my home stereo system for music.  But it is nice to have in case I have it with me in an appropriate environment.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B009C7ZQM4 5 1394064000 44 This little app frees up valuable space on my Kindle Fire HD and erases unwanted files that lurk in the electronic shadows.  I'm not sure that some files might be resurrect-able by some excellent nerd.  Who can know such things,except those masters of technology?
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00B7Y0206 5 1384905600 37 This app allows me to input subjects of my choice to view and, after I see the ones I like most, I can download them to my Tablet.  Video image and sound quality, are really very good.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B009XAJI8S 5 1381363200 29 US TV Free has access to many more TV stations/shows than any other similar APPs that I own.  It's easy to use.  Very cool!  I don't mind the advertisements.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00E1JZIGW 5 1381881600 21 This is one of those APPs that I like to use when waiting on such things as having my car serviced.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00FATEJYE 5 1392854400 26 Graphics are fabulous.  Play is exciting.  And this was free!  Yes, I'll probably purchase at least one add-on.  It's for kids age five through eighty five.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00AREIAI8 4 1392854400 42 Good graphics of horse.  I got a kick out of messing around with it.  I guess it would amuse a young child for a long time - maybe an hour.  It is a feel good toy.  Because it's free, it's worth downloading.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B008RMEGXA 3 1392854400 36 This app(?) is only advertising for several issues of National Geographic magazines.  $4.95 each, or $19.95 for six.  This is a great magazine and this app(?) tempts me to buy.  Buit my 3-STARS is an exaggeration.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B0064X7FVE 5 1394064000 43 This app finds out where I live and gives me the latest weather report available.  Of course, my home address is already sett on my tablet and made available to other websites, but I still wonder at the technology that makes this possible.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B008RA3X5E 3 1378252800 61 The free and the 99 cent versions both contained add-ware.  I don't like paying for an APP that includes add-ware.  I've remove both from my 7" Kindle Fire HD and from my account in the Cloud.However, I have gone ahead and given the APP 3 STARS because the program is otherwise good and some people will not care about the add-ware.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00E1LILWI 5 1378252800 87 I don't have cable so this is the first time I have watched Animal Planet.  I like it and I enjoy watching with this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  It's better for me than viewing it on TV. I can watch when I have the time and choose only the ones that interest me.I bet that I could also get the same access with any pc surfing on the Internet - without using any special app.  I never thought about this before so I didn't try.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B008AZGWYK 4 1399766400 49 I have used this little quickie access to WebMD,.  I'm old so I like quick and easy answers to health problems. But using a search engine to select information on any specific health problem gives a greater selection of opinions from other sources and usually information in greater depth.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00AQ398AY 4 1381363200 36 I've have only used this APP for a month.  It has detected one threat in my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD and the Tablet continues to function as new.  I don't know how good it actually is.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B009LQ8X58 4 1379721600 251 Today, 21 September 2013, I downloaded and ran this APP three times.  Twice with Internet on and the 32GB internal memory.  Each of these two times it seemed to be doing something but it reported that it fixed a few errors both times.  I gave the APP list a quick check and they were intact - not greyed out.The "Clean" APP also listed an SD Card.  But I'm using a Kindle Fire HD.  It has no slot for an SD Card.  Curious, I ran  the APP on the SD Card with Internet off.  It reported that it had fixed hundreds of files.  Then I looked at the APP lists.  Right away the "Clean" APP Icon was greyed out.  As I looked around most App Icons greyed-out in all places, even the Cloud.UPDATE: Same dayFirst note that if you don't do as I did (try to clean the SD Card when one does not exist) you may not have this problem at all.Anyway, I fiddled around with Settings until I tripped over a quick fix.  The trouble is that I'm not sure what I did that solved the problem.  Anyway, I subsequently received an an e-email, in response to my review, that detailed an easy remedy.  I'm keeping it just in case I have a similar problem in the future.I might have given this App 5-STARS except for this problem.  I have gone from 3-STARS back to 4-STARS because of the quick response with a fix.  This remains a very desirable App.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B0064DBE9I 3 1384905600 23 It's not much, but it does work.  I had a lot better similar app on my old Palm Pilot.  It also was free.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B0088P2A7A 3 1398729600 26 This app simply takes your web browser directly to Wikipedia.  Users don't have to sort around on a page from some search engine to find it.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B0098BGYM0 5 1398384000 88 you can start books by giving each of them your own titles.  You can set the number of pages for each one, and entries are made just like any good word processer.  I have so far set-up one for quotations I like, shopping, and one for use as a daily diary.  I will be setting up more as time rolls along.  On the opening page they are represented like books on a library shelf.  You will never have any trouble finding any of the books you have set-up.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B0066TUXU6 2 1399766400 59 This is a great source of entertainment for many.  But it's not for me.  I live on Social Security and must do everything on the cheap.  That rules out Hulu Plus.  There has become so much entertainment that is free, I wouldn't even consider paying for it.  Not any more than I would pay for sex.  Let sponsors pay.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B006VLNIFQ 5 1369785600 25 This little program challenges your reflexes and is fun.  Buy it for free.  It works on Kindle and other tablets even with earlier operating systems.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B004DLNC4I 4 1384905600 28 This APP is really neat.  I was surprised to get local fire and police reception here in Medford, Oregon.  It can even be improved with very little cost.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B004OZOTSQ 4 1381363200 39 For occasional use when you need to know what WIFi are  broadcasting and available.  I have had no need for it so far.  I've just tested it to see how it compares with my other computers WiFi devices.  .
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00975HIYU 4 1392854400 53 Slot Galaxy is a nice little time waster.  Unlike a real slot machine, I seem to just keep on wining.  I guess that's good.  Anyway, it's worth the memory space on my Kindle, and it was free.  I doubt that I'll pay for add-on slots, but they are available if you want.  .
A11KZ906QD08C5 B006DJ2JSI 5 1399766400 34 How could I criticize such a well known and well respected dictionary as the Merriam-Webster's?  I would appear to be illiterate.  Yes, there is a real place for more modern dictionaries - of course.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B0055DL1G4 4 1381363200 20 The NBC APP works on my 7&#34; Kindle fire HD like it works on my Desktop computer with Windows 8.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B007JOA03M 4 1401926400 34 When I use this app to find information concerning health or disease, I get a shortened version of what the Medscape website gives me on my desktop.  That's usually all I usually want anyway.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B008B80ZGW 4 1379894400 117 For all you insomniacs like me: You might benefit from using this App.  I'm glad this was among the first Apps I installed on my Kindle Fire HD.  It uses methods that have been proven to help people relax and get a good night's sleep.  I have this monkey in my head that won't  shut-up long enough to sleep.  At least until it is exhausted.This App has helped me to learn how to relax.  While sleep is still problematic, the benefit of just being able to let my body completely relax has made the App well worth the time and effort spent. And maybe it will be more helpful with my insomnia as I continue using it.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00CFNDUIY 3 1399766400 23 Amusing is fun - fun is amusing  People will probably be amused with this cute little graphic game; but it's not a keeper.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B007XJ3D82 4 1401926400 28 This Diary app is very easy to use and does exactly as the programmer(s) intended.  I have no criticism.  It has never crashed on my 7&#34; Kindle Fire.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B008M87GJK 5 1378598400 77 Another excellent app to have on your Kindle.  It's actually just a more handy way of visiting this website.  Lots of times computer owners want just one thing and it's not worth powering-up the laptop or desktop.  For me this is one of those things.  I like to tune in to BBC because I don't trust local and national news and BBC News at least broadcasts a different prospective - even if it's not always more accurate.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B00DREKMPO 4 1398729600 71 I really am no judge of technical excellence in internet security apps.  I installed this one on my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD March 2013.  I can only say that this one does not appear to slow down any data processing and I have had no problems using it.  But then , while I have not been hit by any virus or malware on my Kindle,  this app hasn't caught any either.LOL
A11KZ906QD08C5 B004SIIBGU 4 1381363200 33 The product listings are in a different format than those accessed on my Computer and I' unsure about the security of transactions.  While this APP does work, I prefer to use my computer.
A11KZ906QD08C5 B004SYIA1U 5 1380240000 78 Old time AM only radio was all we had when I was a little kid, and I sure appreciated it at the time.  For me, this App is a time machine.  Now I can look back, and my memories come back along with the happy feelings I had then.  But the pleasure doesn't stop there.  Revisiting the past this way also increases my appreciation for present day technology.  We've come a long way in just my short lifetime.
A11KZNTR3AZ2HI B00AB7HESI 5 1368921600 24 well I first got it on the D's then I got it on my kindle so fun great for all ages 6 to 100
A11KZNTR3AZ2HI B008V06NRU 5 1368921600 30 its so cool. you can feed it donuts sushi. and even cake! ! omg you can even customize it I don't have any complaints get it now its FREE :)
A11KZNTR3AZ2HI B00DJFIMW6 5 1373673600 22 its so fun!! the best part is that its FREE but with some purchises get it now if u like the movie!!!
A11KZNTR3AZ2HI B004DPCSKI 4 1379203200 23 not the BEST app in the world because it said salmon now and banana when I was eating one!!! omg get this app!!!
A11KZP9BHO4VG B00BX736EG 4 1372118400 24 I am sick addicted to these games.  They definitely get harder  as you go along. Still fun and entertaining. Good way to exercise brain
A11KZP9BHO4VG B00BPC23XO 4 1370908800 21 Start off easy but become more challenging as you do more levels.Good way to pass time or play with the kids.
A11KZP9BHO4VG B00EDQ35D6 3 1384387200 36 The answers Get progressively harder as you complete more levels. It is fun and makes you think. I would recommend fir someone who enjoys a challenge but doesn't like to get stumped fir a ling time.
A11L1G5YFXUBHB B007MTKYQC 3 1332892800 69 I want to like this app, I really do but, the controls are very annoying they respond very slowly and when the respond they turn a lot faster then u should which cause u to crash. I also don't understand the point of checkpoints if they don't save your progress. in all I believe this game had the potential to be good but came short of a descent game
A11L1G5YFXUBHB B0085N9I84 5 1339027200 26 this is one of my favorite games right now on the kindle fire store. its really fun and suprisnigly addicting so overall I think its great.
A11L1G5YFXUBHB B0067VKQLE 5 1332892800 66 this is one of my favorite games on the kindle fire. easy to use, simple controls and a simple objective. yet even though your goal is simple this game requires a good amount of stradegy and thought in order to be successful. overall this game is great, the only backdraw is that there aren't mini games like on the Xbox 360 version. Your doing great POPCAP!
A11L8CW610086O B00HGJ18C2 3 1392076800 26 I love t h e game but there is an AD just about every other hand.  I've never had a game with so many ADs before
A11L8CW610086O B0067R0APK 5 1345766400 22 I especially like the graphics.  This weather app is much more detailed than others I've looked at...the color choices I like also...
A11L8CW610086O B007MC8YLQ 5 1365206400 25 This is a great game. It's Fun and you will sit and play for hours before you even realize that the time has gone by.
A11L8CW610086O B004VA3X7M 5 1362355200 76 I have been shopping Zappos for quite a few years.  I have &#34;never&#34; had a problem with the product or service.If i send an email about an issue or just a question they are always right back with an answer within a day.I go nowhere else for my shoes.The selection is 2nd to none.  They have more sizes and widths than any other.I recommend everyone try them at least once.  They won't be sorry they did...
A11L8CW610086O B008JK6W5K 4 1360540800 20 need more information on the game,  it took a while to try used to the format otherwise good mind game
A11LBPHXVPK2O B008YU0AOE 3 1374883200 28 Works for just  a quick calculation, but nothing out of the ordinary or remarkable about this App. Just like any other one that may come on your phone...
A11LBPHXVPK2O B004VOJT0I 3 1374883200 109 This app is nice if you want to search for recipes and have something pretty specific in mind, but the user interface is lacking. In order to search you have to select a dish type (ie: breakfast, bread, dessert, beverage...), ingredient, and ready in time. Very annoying if you want to look for more than one ingredient type or if your ingredient is not on there. There is also a more general search where you can get around this, but seems to run slow. All in all it is not too bad, but could use some improvement. I cannot complain too much though because it is free after all!
A11LBPHXVPK2O B008XG1X18 5 1376006400 35 I mostly use pinterest to find new recipes, but there are all sorts of things you can search based on your interests. You name it and pinterest has it...full of all kinds of creative ideas!
A11LDMI7BDZLSJ B00B6PO6AI 4 1371168000 49 I think that this is probably one of the best and most difficult games that I've ever played.  It's not just the challenge of the images, but also the need to associate them with each other that can make it so hard.  Great for those that enjoy word games.
A11LDMI7BDZLSJ B0091REZMW 4 1373500800 43 I first played it on Facebook and when I saw it here I knew that I had to play it on my Kindle.  It sometimes hangs, but it seems to keep track of your game play so you don't lose points and experience.
A11LDMI7BDZLSJ B00COVCV50 5 1371340800 28 This is a great game to play for advancing your brain power.  It can be frustrating at times, but it can also be the most fun to play.
A11LDVCPN8F60Y B005DTZAZS 1 1341878400 24 I currently have the highest end android device on the market and the app won't even load for me.  Waste of a free app.
A11LDVCPN8F60Y B00701L5XS 2 1342656000 140 I really wish I had an app like this for when I was a boy scout, as learning how to tie a knot via handbook didn't always have good enough illustration to teach, and I would have to be in the presence of my Scoutmaster to really hone my knot-tying skills.  Lo and behold, boy scouts and camping enthusiasts can learn things much better and easier with this app!So why only three stars?  It goes way overboard on permissions, and I have to automatically deduct 1 star for OpenFeint (I wish that company would go the way of the dodo already, seriously), 1 star for network permissions, and 1 more because it just feels right.  Permissions notwithstanding, this is a five-star app, and I will definitely give it such a rating if and when the developers remove the unnecessary fluff.
A11LDVCPN8F60Y B00HRMNKWE 4 1399075200 22 It's a fun game.  Would have given it 5 stars if they gave me 100 or more coins to review the game.
A11LDVCPN8F60Y B007V2UGPE 4 1341964800 163 This is definitely one of the most fun games available on the android market.  While they definitely encourage you to make IAP's in this game, the fact of the matter is that you can earn plenty of GLU currency in-game to make necessary item/unit upgrades as the game gets tougher.As far as the fun factor goes, it is definitely a 5-star game through and through.  The only drawback has to be the occasional slow framerates during the game.  When there is a lot of action on the screen, lag incurred has definitely resulted in a death or two.  Framerate issues also happen all the time while playing pachinko; you have to shoot the balls quickly to keep the prize multiplier maxed out at 5x.  Overall, these problems are slight, and don't severely detract from the quality of the game.  I highly recommend checking this out, and will gladly award an additional star if and when the framerate problems are remedied in the future.
A11LG6O10KI0K5 B004SBS8LA 5 1300752000 57 Installed no problem on Evo and the framerates are excellent. LOVE having no ads. Really thinking of purchasing the other Angry Birds as the ads drive me CRAZY! If you're on AT&T the problem is with your PROVIDER, not with Amazon or Rovio. Time to get a real phone (as in a non crippled Android) and provider.
A11LG6O10KI0K5 B004L5WS2S 5 1302134400 29 I got this app for free but have bought it for the rest of the family. it looks simple but it is very engaging and fun! well worth $0.99.
A11LG6O10KI0K5 B004X80QNG 5 1323388800 57 This app is great and works flawlessly. For you Amazon Fire users, there IS NO Google calendar on your device because it is not an official Google product. There is nothing wrong with this app and should not be rated down because your device is lacking.I am really looking forward to using this in my GTD system.
A11LGCY3GBVFJ8 B005UQ9FNC 1 1359158400 25 it gets soooooooo boring in the first couple minutes I wish they made it a little bit more fun I deleted it off my kindle.
A11LGCY3GBVFJ8 B005HB4F08 3 1361664000 33 its sortta boring no affense to those who like it I'm not a big fan I wish it had a little more pizzaz. u know what I mean its okay for me enjoy
A11LGCY3GBVFJ8 B00AIUUXHC 5 1356220800 20 I wouldn't recommend for kids. this game is soooooo awesome u can level up and just do what u want.
A11LGCY3GBVFJ8 B00AA0TJO8 4 1356912000 53 omg I wish I could write a million things on how awesome this app is.its so hard to find apps like this so fun and exciting and adventerous.if only people could make more apps like this that would be so much better.more fun more 5 stars.and I'm speechless now so listen to this.dgctufuytfyfufjyf$7$*&amp;&amp;##&amp;gfhhxhfgcuuxhxhxxhgdhxhdhxhxhxgfxhf
A11LJ8QVMZP3C6 B007R41E8O 5 1342569600 38 I thought the game was great. the storyline was interesting, the puzzles were challenging the only issue I have was the room in the basement of that big house was a little too dark to see the items.
A11LJ8QVMZP3C6 B007MPJQ38 5 1342569600 26 I love these types of games! I just wish there were more. they did a good job. challenging enough to spend an afternoon on it. perfect
A11LJ8QVMZP3C6 B006JNH7YY 4 1326585600 44 graphics are fantastic, great plot and really good puzzles. the only reason it doesn't get a five star rating is because some of the puzzles are really testy. you have to click on the same spot way too many times to select the object.
A11LLBLFRE59AI B0063IH60K 5 1325376000 20 I love this game. My husband would have lots to say about, except, I won't let him have a turn.
A11LLBLFRE59AI B006QC53WG 2 1344643200 23 You need 80 scarabs quickly...to advance...it would be easier to compete if I knew that in the beginning. But it is still fun.
A11LO6UA21JEAP B008KYOCA2 5 1363478400 104 I have burned thru 4 other calendar apps before finding this one. All I REALLY wanted was a calendar that you could see your events on, without having to click on the individual dates. I loooove that I can just look at the month and see all my events easily listed on the calendar, just like a regular calendar. It has great icons, lists, &amp; other great features too - but my selling point was the ease of just looking at my calendar and being able to see all the month's events laid out. I also find that the repeating feature is very handy.
A11LO6UA21JEAP B00A9JG6RS 5 1359504000 23 Love this game! I've loved every version so far!!! What fun!! The sound effects are great and I love all the birds` expressions!
A11LO6UA21JEAP B00D3MWW44 5 1391126400 21 My 10 year old daughters love this game!! They love the way they can make the dolphin move around and jump.
A11LO6UA21JEAP B00AREIAI8 5 1360281600 26 My 8 year old daughter loves this app ALMOST as much as she loves horses!!! It is very lifelike and the graphics are excellent! Super fun!!
A11LPRBN7Q1J0U B004SIIBGU 5 1398384000 21 This app helps me keep up with all of my eBay stuff. Makes it so much easier with finding things so
A11LPRBN7Q1J0U B0094BB4TW 5 1396051200 24 Easier way for me to jump on and check out what is going on in between reading books. Will love having the extra access
A11LPRBN7Q1J0U B005ZXWMUS 5 1394496000 22 Love this app.... I love being able to go in and watch anything that I want... Works very well with the kindle
A11LPRBN7Q1J0U B00BTL5YMI 5 1396051200 20 Great game to play on your down time. I play in between reading books. Have fun with this slots game
A11LW5DR7VZJH7 B00AREIAI8 1 1363564800 32 I set up the account and named my horse but I just did not find the site, user-friendly or engaging which is the whole purpose of a game such as this. Sorry.
A11LW5DR7VZJH7 B00AKNSOSM 5 1363564800 45 If you're looking for an all inclusive funny site, this is it. You can view funny pics from every category as well as funny videos. As with any other site, if you have young children, visit the site together until you become familiar with it.
A11LW5DR7VZJH7 B008194C74 5 1354838400 34 I am really enjoying this game. It took me a bit to get the hang of it but now I find myself going to this game during my down times. I recommend it completely!
A11LWBBMOY3FHD B00GXH3TGG 3 1395014400 20 This game was ok but you &#34;run out of money&#34; too soon. So I deleted it from my kindle fire.

A11M1STAKL9SLA B0097M6WDG 5 1393718400 63 I love this game I wanted it so long but when I saw the video I thought it was going to show sex but it didn't and my sister thought It was bad but it wasn't I thought is was going to show private parts but didn't luckily. beacause no one should see any sexsual stuff but I love the game so much.
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B006QMYF0W 5 1392768000 28 I rated this 5 stars because it was very fast. It's not quite as quick to give up a win. I would recommend this game to anyone.out there.
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B00IAQ3RJM 3 1403049600 20 This game started slow for me. Then I got the hang of it; I expect my rating will go up.
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B00EC5ZFL8 1 1389830400 23 There were too many adds. Plus they kept asking for money after one game. Then would stop the  game. I don't likeThe game.
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B009KS4XRO 4 1402531200 20 I chose four because I still can't beat it. The graphics are good. The game and it's explanation are obvious.
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B00975HIYU 4 1393027200 20 I lost everything all my levels all  my points. I had to reset. Due to  a porn bomb mal wareOoo
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B00H2BJ7HC 4 1390953600 22 I lived this this right off the bat. It was fast and  the payoffs were generous.I would recommend this to my friends.
A11M2X9G8YJJMR B00BMW6ER8 3 1391558400 24 I enjoy playing bingo. this game is fun but I would like it. Much more if it was not always hitting me to  buy.

A11M38F8P95O3J B005ZFOOE8 5 1341705600 20 this app is great for listening to music it is great so you can listen to your favorite radio stations.

A11M38F8P95O3J B009ZE27US 1 1354752000 21 this game was terrible.. cause it didn't get the right age 1st of all. then is sometimes it would even scan
A11M38F8P95O3J B004ZALKMI 2 1336003200 21 it does nt have much to do but when you shake the kindle or wateva. but other than that its ok

A11M38F8P95O3J B007NZV2HK 3 1341705600 34 this game is fun to do in the car and stuff but it has so many pop ups and stuff for free games and other stuff but other than that its a good game
A11M38F8P95O3J B006VXRNYG 4 1341705600 25 its a great app just to Color and draw what ever you want. I also like that its kinda like a movie after you draw.

A11M3BYJAN7YUK B00KMX5V8G 5 1405641600 27 I've been waiting for this app for some time, and now that's it's here and free. It was so worth the wait. A game for all ages.
A11M5C4VSC48KY B006ON41FC 1 1329436800 51 I didn't get this game yet when I noticed openfeint is mandatory. Openfeint is not trusted by myself so I am not installing. Usually there is an option but this? No thank you.And it sounds like you can't turn the sound off. Poor options does not meet my standards. Sorry amazon.
A11M5C4VSC48KY B0050KDTSK 5 1328918400 60 I LOVED this game!!!! Although the gems can cost money, coins are easy to earn and you can decorate your farm any way you want! Name your farmer, and plow your way through the game! You can also make a storm8 id-mine is champvisits- and make neighbors! couldn't ask for anything more!!! Feel free to add my storm8 id ;)
A11M5C4VSC48KY B006VXRNYG 5 1328832000 29 I loved this app. I love how you can play what you drew! This is highly recommended for children. Although you cannot pick the color, it's worth it! :)

A11M5VSIF1C4JD B005XQLBU4 5 1400803200 23 This is one of the best games I have ever gotten. whoever came up with it ts sharper than my pocket knife.-The MockingJay
A11M5VSIF1C4JD B00EBQRSTK 4 1377475200 21 Thought it was fun just download. It is kid friendly had to ask for help a lot like fuss the movie
A11M5VSIF1C4JD B00F8H0LM2 5 1379635200 30 the force is strong with this one if you want a good game do not get this on the other hand if you want a great app get it now
A11M5VSIF1C4JD B0086700CM 4 1378857600 25 fun but takes forever to finish I like the goals keeps you going. want to get the second one goodbye and have a good time
A11M5VSIF1C4JD B00FAPF5U0 4 1384992000 37 it is ok i guess. i do not like that you have lives an once you use all of them it is over until you get them back on a time scale.  a lot of hard levels.
A11M5VSIF1C4JD B00F8GYC1Y 5 1379635200 37 the force is strong with this oneis it better than the free one can not wait for up date so keep up with game data! does it have more worlds than free one I think the thridworld

A11M76FZMRWU4Y B00DRA55DW 5 1377820800 24 My granddaughters love to play this. They spend lots of time designing each nail.If you have young girls they would probably love it too.
A11M76FZMRWU4Y B00AJ8SRFI 5 1356825600 29 My granddaughter loves this. I like it too. She can spend a long time moving through and dressing the models.  It is her favorite thing to do right now.
A11M76FZMRWU4Y B0064DBE9I 5 1355875200 28 Downloaded this a couple of weeks ago. My grandchildren love this. They do have a hard time keeping up but don't seem to care. The continue to try.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00ED4TX2A 3 1384300800 20 To me...this is a confusing game. It might be good for younger kids who play these games all the time.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B004VOJT0I 5 1384300800 28 I do a lot of cooking and even more baking. There are times when I feel like baking but don't know what to make. This solved that problem.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B004SOR4H6 3 1381795200 23 I just don't get it. I know everyone uses it but to me I prefer facebook. There is more interaction on other sites
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383523200 22 I played this on Facebook but I didn't always want to be on the computer. Now I can play on my kindle
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00A4O6NMG 5 1381795200 35 This is a very cute game and I would recommend it to people of all ages. I'm old and I like it. I'm not big on figuring things out on these games but it's fun.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00IAQ3RJM 5 1403049600 29 I love this game. You gain enough coin to purchase more lives unlike other games. So you can feed the addiction from playing this game. You will enjoy it
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B008V06NRU 5 1384300800 28 This is one of my favorite games. You clean, feed and take care of Pou. There are a bunch of different games in this game and it's free
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00DGEB2XG 5 1381622400 30 This is a great game but it's like it's not finished. You get addicted and then you run out of floors. Who ever made it really needs to finish it.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00DJFIMW6 5 1377561600 28 I got this game for my daughter. She loves it and is pretty good at it. She got me playing it and it is hard to put down.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B004SJ3AXI 5 1362182400 22 My husband bought this but it has since been deleted. We bought a touch screen computer and he wanted to try it.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B004SIIBGU 5 1381795200 36 Ebay is awesome. I have been selling things I have laying around that I don't need anymore and ebay is the place to sell. with this app, I can do quick checks on all my things
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B0094BB4TW 5 1377561600 38 What can I say...it's Facebook.  I have found tons of old high school friends that I never thought I'd ever see again. You do have to be careful, it is a social network. Don't give out personal information.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00KOEHQCW 5 1403568000 29 This game starts out pretty easy and gets more difficult. It addictive too. A lot of fun.  You can choose to purchase in this game but don't have too.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B009G9KFQ0 4 1381795200 53 Its a little confusing to me. I was hoping I could put in like my daughters school and get the picture of what is going on there but you have to run through a bunch of different places till you find the one you want. Other than that its good. I'd recommend it
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B004YF1LLY 5 1383523200 25 I don't buy a lot from qvc but when I want to check on items I can quickly do this now on my kindle....5 stars
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00E78QIDE 2 1381795200 22 I thought I would like this app but I'm finding out i'm not good at riddles. So it is not for me
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00BNJGZBK 1 1381622400 30 I can't afford to pay for games. To me, it's just not worth the money. You get the first part of the game then you have to pay for more.
A11MKIKOOXUQK0 B00AUB8GA0 2 1381795200 24 it was ok in the beginning. its all the same thing over and over. I won't delete it but I wont recommend it either
A11MMRRKCHRKPT B00GY0PQZ4 3 1405987200 110 I enjoyed the game at first, once I got the hang of it. But, I had to quit. My personal experience does not match that of the creator of this game. For example, the category was musicians. I don't listen to popular music, so I did not know any of the names for which I was to search. I could purchase hints, but that is not how I want to spend my money. Another category was sports. I was confused when the word I was to select was &#34;offense.&#34; That is not a sport and not necessarily a sports term. Perhaps a word bank could help those players like me.
A11MMRRKCHRKPT B00FAPF5U0 5 1383868800 30 More challenging than bejeweled. This game offers more challenge and strategy. It offers more interaction with friends. I've had more fun with this than with other games similar to it.
A11MMRRKCHRKPT B00GRXA7GG 5 1403568000 35 The different games on this app keep it from becoming boring. I enjoy playing very much. There are a few game choices that I wish had larger tiles, but that doesn't keep me from playing.
A11MMRRKCHRKPT B008UXIDYE 2 1354579200 28 i was not aware the app read the bible to you when i purchased it. that is not what i wanted, so i deleted it. will buy another.
A11MMRRKCHRKPT B00GRPD0J0 4 1403568000 30 The app makes accessing email easier, but there are times it won't work. Usually, I can come out and tap it again to work. Needless to say, that is irritating.
A11MMRRKCHRKPT B00E3WJRIM 5 1377648000 22 This is a very fun game. I enjoy playing with my friends. Better than the game on television. (I have that too.)
A11MNITYNJCKTR B00DEG4Z1W 5 1372032000 21 This is the same as toca hair salon 2 except cheaper I differently recommend this app. =-) please get this app
A11MNITYNJCKTR B005ZXWMUS 1 1370563200 26 I instantly deleted from my kindle beacause you apparently need a subscription ($7 per month) which i was not getting so I had to delete it
A11MNITYNJCKTR B007OXASB2 4 1364083200 62 The reason i am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 is cuz there are gems and pets cost gems but gems cost money the only way to get gems is to complete tasks but some of those task you need gems so some of the pets i can not buy :(  other than that it is a really funand addicting game.
A11MNITYNJCKTR B00DOUQP9I 3 1375142400 22 This game was not bad but it was not good either. I don't recommend it to anyone.Save time and do not get
A11MNITYNJCKTR B00DJFIMW6 1 1374192000 39 I got this app and it downloaded fine but when I opened the app it just frozed my kindle I had to shut my whole kindle down and restart it after I did that I just deleted the app
A11MO6UAUASGRA B00881VLCE 3 1366243200 20 Very same &#34;It's Okay&#34;.  Beginning to dislike these ratings!!!  Probably will not rate anything else.  Five more words required... goodbye.
A11MO6UAUASGRA B007BUITZU 3 1366243200 25 Played with it a bit before my Kindle malfunctioned again.  Not too special but maybe if I was younger.  Cute but not wanted any more.
A11MO6UAUASGRA B009OA3TQ4 3 1366243200 19 OK but just not needed anymore.  Thanks??More words needed really!!  One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00A3NQNUU 5 1363392000 23 Very cute. And I'm buying things for cash, I don't normally do that. You will like it. Upgrades are cute, love the dragons.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00BWBHIUG 5 1369267200 33 I have to say this is a good quality game. Excellent music, u don't mind keeping I open all day. Beautiful and colors. Adorable fish, and cute little quests, u don't feel overwhelmed.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00AKL1XPU 5 1367625600 54 This game is interactive and you usually don't get that in a building game. You search for your animals, you feed, breed, get buildings, and so forth. I was trying to wait before I gave a review since I am new to the app. From what I can tell so far I like it.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00CF354UG 1 1380585600 20 it doesnt load i tried restarting 4 times the kindle but it still crashes needs an update asap please help.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00910Y1OQ 5 1357171200 30 This game is my down time game, my relax, my way to escape for just a little. Not to hard, not to easy, just right. Keep up the good work.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B008YRVW0I 5 1356825600 41 I like the fact that I can earn money to buy what I need instead of paying real cash for everything. Keeps me interested, and that's hard to do when it comes to apps for me. Keep up the good work.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00DVKOYBM 5 1385424000 34 This is by far the best 8 ball pool game ever you will fall in love so addicting it's crazy how much this game has going for it I highly recommend getting this game.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B007ZGO7EM 5 1374710400 44 Large numbers, you won't push two numbers at a time. Simple and to the point, good for checking, savings, simple school projects, etc. Will remember the last numbers or calculation you just did..which is very important. Excellent I give it a five star rating.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B00BJA2VFW 2 1365292800 24 Love these types of games, I bought this hoping to play it. Won't even go passed first page. I hope you fix this soon.
A11MOB2KEZ0SSA B005AJ6ISO 5 1367366400 25 Words from the bible, encouraging words needed to get through every day. We all need this every day to make it in this crazy world
A11MPHKMO4RNA0 B0067Q42BY 4 1376092800 22 Like the game, but keep forgetting what the wild tiles do. Nice graphics and the different puzzles keep you on your toes.
A11MPHKMO4RNA0 B00BEPVAV8 5 1376092800 23 Best buggy's and lots of fun, says my nephew. Great graphics and easy to control with the ability to change how to steer.
A11MPHKMO4RNA0 B00910Y1OQ 5 1363478400 59 I grabbed this app awhile back when it was free and forgot about it. Recently downloaded this app to my kindle and am enjoying it. The graphics are great on the kindle and is fun to play. It is a Quest and strategy bejewel mix. Makes you think to get past the blocks and get all of your points.
A11MRWED84EO1C B00AQF8CJ0 5 1370822400 48 This game is easy to learn, but it's hard to master.  You have to get all of the puddings together without sliding them off the screen.  There are different puddings that have different abilities and you will use them all to help the puddings take over the world
A11MRWED84EO1C B0097HSS4M 5 1387411200 56 This app is one of the best editing apps I have found.  You can take a picture and edit it right away or pick a picture from your gallery and edit that.  You have a wide range of options when it comes to the various filters and effects for your photos.  I highly recommend this app!
A11MRWED84EO1C B009C7ZQM4 5 1372982400 93 I have tried several different cache cleaning apps and this one is the best out of them all.  Other ones I tried never seemed to clean out the caches on my LG Lucid phone so it always felt sluggish.  I am not sure how this one does it, but it frees up more memory and doesn't affect the running of the phone in any way.  While this is a free app, the features it offers makes it worth paying for.If you need extra memory on Android device, this is the one to get!!
A11MRWED84EO1C B00ALKKM98 5 1357257600 33 This is a good game.  The concept is easy to pick up, but to link the dots without crossing lines isn't as easy as it seems to be.  This is a great game!
A11MTD5EUF99N1 B00CSR2J9I 4 1371686400 28 Keep it handy for kids at work. Very nice for the younger children.  I've also tried to play it &#9733;so far haven't made it through the hills !!!
A11MTD5EUF99N1 B00CWY76CC 2 1373414400 20 L don't know how to get out of room.  I find things but don't knowwhat to do with them!!! Please.
A11MTD5EUF99N1 B006UJMHD8 2 1367539200 37 Dont like the way I have to go all the way and start over again,  maybe instead of that points could b taken away.  It just takes too long going all the way back over and over.
A11MYYGKB6PON0 B004SJ3AXI 5 1327536000 21 people say it does not work but it works fine.Great game but not the best.(the dragon is free) I recommend it
A11MYYGKB6PON0 B007TLOYZU 5 1334448000 30 u should get the game but its boring after a while I also have it on my ipod touch for free that's one difference and two I'm first comment suckers
A11MYYGKB6PON0 B00F7YHDWC 2 1383350400 39 just like dumb ways to live that really wasnt made for the kindle fire like they make u blow a plane(thts wht she said)to keep it from hiting the ground which is impossible and the graphics arent tht great
A11MYYGKB6PON0 B0069Y4E08 1 1329004800 41 I don't have the app but why ru guys paying five bucks for hd its a rip off u just wasted money something u can get for .99 cents on or free (with ads) don't waste ur money on angry birds.
A11MYYGKB6PON0 B006OC2ANS 5 1330732800 20 gdhhd dhhdhxh dhhdgsg shdhgg dyhdgd hdhdg ehdgg dhdhfh fhdhyd fyhfhd hdudhd. hdhhdgdgdhfhhfh xvgg tc. Cfc. ffcc rfff hhgdvydygdv dhhhhdudhdhdhhdhf hdhdhhhd
A11N0VHOIHL9L B00DZYXTRY 5 1398211200 25 I love it you can play learn and have fun! I am learning it greatly awsomeness! (; love it and redolent and finally on aneroid
A11N0VHOIHL9L B00AIUUXHC 4 1364083200 32 I love it I saw my best friend play it I was like wow what's that and I got it so I like it I love it I want somore of it!(;
A11N16IQOL9Y7X B009XAJI8S 1 1379030400 24 Like the scanner app this app doesn't do anything for me. It has to do something but not . Most of channels don't work
A11N16IQOL9Y7X B00ADPH2YO 4 1383004800 25 It's fun to play and easy to play. Awesome I just started playing its easy to get addicted to it . Start and have fun.
A11N16IQOL9Y7X B0089336YM 1 1379030400 21 If I lived in those cities it would be great but but I don't so it doesn't do me any good
A11N2I5P5W4M2L B0085CEBGY 4 1342137600 23 I enjoyed this game a lot.  Once I figured out what I needed to do to get started I couldn't put it down!
A11N2I5P5W4M2L B008R9OIUO 4 1345248000 22 Fun to play, graphics are good.  I wish you could zoom in!  You can upgrade but I don't see the price anywhere?
A11N2I5P5W4M2L B008DWM0QY 4 1342137600 26 The only down side to this game would be the 20 minute download time for my Kindle.  I loved the graphics and the story was interesting
A11N2I5P5W4M2L B007T8Z5PG 5 1343433600 24 This game had me entertained for hours.  The graphics are great with an interesting story.  Another winner from MumboJumbo!  Worked great on Kindle Fire.
A11N91R102OLO B007OAGY40 3 1357257600 41 I don't think Duke is quite ready for touch screens.  While it was fun to play a game from my teenage years, it was very frustrating to try to play on a cell phone.  Definitely a game that needs a controller!
A11N91R102OLO B008FRG6JO 5 1357257600 69 This is the best game ever!  You can toggle through options to reach the prize.  No in-game coins (sorry guys, you must use cash); but if you can navigate through the maze of options, the prize is a piping hot pizza available at your door (or in a domino's store).  Sure, it may not keep you captivated for hours, but this worth a few minutes of happy, cheesy bliss!
A11N91R102OLO B008DM4OTA 5 1357257600 37 My daughter, fell in love with this game immediately (come on, it has cute animals!)  She spent hours playing the game, and became quite adept at playing.  I'll keep an eye out for the other Panda games.
A11N91R102OLO B0085YNML2 5 1357257600 25 I really had fun playing this.  The game is in the same vein as Cut the Rope and other puzzle games.  Well, worth the purchase.
A11N91R102OLO B00846I1Y4 4 1354665600 34 While this piano really won't create the next concierto, it's a great time waster for your toddler that love the sound of animals. I tend to get a little tired of the animal sounds.
A11N91R102OLO B007FJFDXS 5 1359849600 47 This is definitely a fun game.  It can be little frustrating learning the controls, but I can assure you it can be fun.  Even my three year old daughter is hooked.  I have a lot of other preschooler games, but she always seems to gravitate to Edge.
A11N91R102OLO B005KN7NQ6 4 1354665600 41 Although my daughter is a 3 year old. She loves this game.  Granted, she  is just barely learning the steering motion, but the fact that she is &#34;driving&#34; a car and able to blow a horn gave her hours of fun.
A11N91R102OLO B007N9FKCY 4 1357257600 44 I don't know if it was just my fingers not cooperating, but I had a bit of trouble controlling that little bean.  Outside of that, though, the idea of the game was fun and worth a try if you're able to train your fingers!
A11N91R102OLO B00AEWUQG2 3 1359849600 83 I've enjoyed playing this game, but there are some issues.In-game cash can be annoying.  There's a slot machine that usually pops up when you return to the game.  It's frustrating to have to close it every time.  It's also frustrating that I get a notice to sign into Facebook, but my smart phone says the settings for Facebook are wrong.Oh well, if you can get past that, you can have fun answering questions to hopefully prove you are smarter than a fifth grader.
A11ND1RP9JJMZC B004VMUS9G 5 1372809600 59 I was looking for a simple alarm clock for my Kindle, and this one fits the bill. Not only can you have multiple alarms (one-time or repeatable), but you can also add your music to it. I can wake up to any music on my Kindle and customize playlists for each alarm. Best free app I have downloaded yet.
A11NE24X1PP3UW B00H7Y9CKG 5 1395792000 47 This game is awesome you guy need to get this game for the iPad and the kindle Fire you guy can breed Dragon s and battle. ps  I think you guy should update because this is the best game of 2014!I rate this game 5out of 5.
A11NE24X1PP3UW B00CWKYUSE 5 1400889600 26 I love this game so plese have multiplayer mode on because I want be challenge my friend in to a soccer game.  Ps  100out of 100
A11NE24X1PP3UW B008KMAJQU 3 1377129600 33 I think that sas zombie assault 3 should be updated because my friend sas  zombie assault 3 update and I couldn't play for the kindle Fire so please update the kindle Fire game.
A11NECL5CAER19 B00ATDOVNK 5 1372377600 52 Wow! That's all i could come up with! It was suspenseful, and there was a very twisted ending! I am not gonna tell u anymore cuz im gonna leave u to experience it yourself, and yes, there are sound effects along with clips that go along with the game!! Awesome and Spectacular!!!
A11NECL5CAER19 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1382918400 44 At first, i thought this was just a game where you're stuck in a room with a box, but this actually proved me wrong! U have to use ur brains to figure out the puzzles, and it's awesome!!! U really gotta try this out!!!!
A11NHGFQK1HHDI B00GSZEBE2 3 1400630400 188 I initially downloaded this for my child on his Kindle Fire. We purchased that for him over a smart phone because we are deployed overseas, after he lost interest and asked for help I TOOK OVER!  MWAHAHAHAHA!  Now I am 70 levels in and have the 125 buck elevator, but the game WILL NOT LOAD!  I have been stuck in a 20 minute loop of "tinydeathstar has stopped."  Are you kidding me.  I just had myself and the child roped back in to both playing and now you crash. Programming fail.  I am not going to delete it as of yet, since I am hopeful that LucasArts will correct this.  I have faith as I have been playing their games since the old days of Manic Mansion and Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe (ok So that one was LucasFilm, but Fix it!).EDIT- I can get it to load now.  I sometimes have to put the device into airplane mode to do so.  The addition of video adds have also had a negative impact.  As we are too far in now to turn back we are nursing it along.
A11NHGFQK1HHDI B004HXHVZ8 5 1403568000 20 Fantastic!  Linked it to my VUDU/Ultraviolet account and my child has access to digital copies on the go!  Awesome job!
A11NJGWOAM2D9F B005ZXWMUS 5 1380240000 21 This app works well and is extremely user friendly. One of the most forthright apps that I have. I highly recommend.
A11NJGWOAM2D9F B004SRPXWQ 3 1373241600 60 Very cute for kids entertainment but it takes up a lot of space on your device. So, I recommend downloading this on an expandable memory card.  I deleted it from my tablet and downloaded it again on the SD and it is fine. Again, good for entertaining kids on a long drive or to occupy them when on rainy days!
A11NJGWOAM2D9F B0064X7FVE 5 1401235200 41 Hey, everyone needs The Weather Channel application whether you know it or not.  I use this app daily.  I may not like what the weather may be outside, but the app gives me information on the weather quickly without any maneuvering.
A11NJGWOAM2D9F B007K8RFJ4 5 1384300800 20 I love this Application.  Couldn't live without it! This allows to to have all of my sites at my finguretips!
A11NJGWOAM2D9F B006PJ3UKC 5 1373241600 35 Great app! If you are like me and a fan of USA today, this app is for you! I find myself reading the site more now that I have the app. Quick, easy and free!
A11NJGWOAM2D9F B0081JPTXK 5 1401235200 40 I love DDC.  I play this every morning.  It is relaxing and it mimics the real casino play unlike any other casino app out there.  I enjoy this app more than others I've tried.  Put your cares away and play.
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00A9VD67E 5 1372982400 23 Love this app.  Just finished 101 + 31 and loved that too!  Don't even think about it just download it today.  It's free.
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00EBQRSTK 5 1377129600 21 Love these type of games.  I'm a total addict.  This app is great fun for your whole family.  Download it today.
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00EBQRZBG 4 1387152000 40 These type of puzzle games are my favorite.  This one is fairly easy with a tough one every ten or so.  The ads though there are not that annoying and easily deleted from the screen.  This is a good one!
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00BX736EG 4 1366848000 25 I love this game.  Kinda hard but it's no fun when it's too easy.  Anyone who likes word games will have fun with this one.
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00CJ8P82Q 5 1368403200 29 Really great game!!!  TOTALLY addicting.  I can't stop playing.  This is a keeper for sure.  After you beat each level you can always go back and better your time.
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00COVCV50 4 1386028800 25 Love these type of puzzle games so download it write your own review and enjoy.  Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year to all!
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B0073LHCCS 5 1372118400 26 Love this game.  I have a weakness for trivia, brain teasers. Etc.  This is a great one.  Fun to play by yourself or with a friend.
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00FAPF5U0 1 1382313600 46 Finally got this for kindle and was truly excited til I got to level 35 and found out I had to pay to go on.  I am so disappointed and wish I would have known b4 I downloaded it because I wouldn't have.Bad form King Games
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00IAQ3RJM 5 1398556800 35 After playing over 200 levels of candy crush I thought it would be quite a while til I played another match 3 game but I'm thoroughly addicted to this game.  Try it you'll love it!!!!
A11NLJCGJCX5GA B00C7D6ZP2 5 1368748800 25 Love this app!!!  Fun and hilarious at the same time.  My favorite are the background sounds especially in the cubicle scene.  Classic!!!  Get this one!!!
A11NOHYMLI0Y1L B008JGSM6G 5 1385337600 24 This is a cool, fun, free brain teaser. os full of challenges from easy to hard to almost insane. What more could you want.
A11NOHYMLI0Y1L B00CWKYUSE 5 1390176000 26 great game it is almost like the console game but for your tablet, and it is free! what's better than that, worth the long download wait.
A11NOHYMLI0Y1L B008K8VDPU 5 1384128000 63 I upgraded to the payed version and i mean any song you can think of this app has a strong likely to have it. video game music, movie music, even some hip hop, Nd classical can be found in this app. not only that but it will teach you to play that song too. its fun and worth the money. a great app.
A11NOHYMLI0Y1L B00D5O7BPU 4 1382572800 50 i have never fired any of these weapons before. i have hunted and shot at ranges but never with these ww2 guns but i am confident i can properly operate these rifle and pistols when i encounter them. over all this app is ok not great but not poor either.
A11NPINQYNXLE6 B006P2Y2QK 5 1362268800 23 It is an easy game to play and very easy to understand. But it does take some thought.Clear graphics makes this game fun!
A11NPINQYNXLE6 B006QMNQ6Q 2 1372723200 24 I used to be a good speller, but this game just furstrates me. For a spelling game it would not be my first choice.
A11NPINQYNXLE6 B00B29PJGS 5 1381795200 25 Word Hunt is a great way to keep your mind sharp. And I find that picking your level can make your hunt hard or easy.
A11NQE63FENAQ3 B00CAW96DI 5 1366502400 27 This is a wonderful twist on an already intriguing game. Playing first thing on the morning really fer the brain ready for the challanges of the day.
A11NQE63FENAQ3 B00E5GJ7QS 4 1381190400 24 This is a great version of the bingo game. I think everyone should at least give it a try. You will find it addicting.
A11NQE63FENAQ3 B00AIQP9DE 5 1358121600 23 Really enjoyed playing this game!!! Wondering when the next one will be available??  Waiting anxiously for the sequel!!!! Fingers crossed and breath held.
A11NSGRVDY8J84 B007F2EGFQ 2 1333238400 33 it super cute and fun but it glitches way way way too much. fix the bugs and i will play. i dont like being punished by having wilted crops due to your problems.
A11NSGRVDY8J84 B008MM9630 3 1349568000 50 this game is very addicting but as a free app it should be a FREE app. you have to pay to get anything accomplished including expanding the farm to make it big enough to earn enough coins to spend on stuff. most stuff you have to pay real money for.
A11NSGRVDY8J84 B006N1K1AE 5 1333152000 20 i love this! my 4 year old loves being able to draw fabulous pictures for everyone. best drawing app here
A11NVWRXYJDEAO B00CAW96DI 4 1379289600 21 This game makes you think a little but not to much! I enjoy the help the clues when I get stuck.
A11NVWRXYJDEAO B00DZJ4O2S 3 1379116800 27 I did notRealize  I would know so many name brands symbols , I think I have been brain washed! This is a fun, addictive game, try it!
A11NVWRXYJDEAO B00EYTRD0I 5 1378684800 25 Great game of this type, enjoy how it's set up to play, you can move forward &amp; return back to a box after rethinking it.
A11NVWRXYJDEAO B00F24OV8G 4 1379030400 23 This is a very innovative and interesting game I like to play as long as I have enough time and coins, it's addictive
A11NWJ0J1AGDL2 B004H6WTJI 5 1348963200 78 I am not very tehno savy and this is easy even for me. Great way to manage my health. I am a breast cancer survivor and this app has helped me become more aware of what I am putting into my body. The feature that has helped the most is sharing with friends so we can encourage each other and share tips along the way. So glad I found this and will suggest it to all my friends.
A11NWJ0J1AGDL2 B009KS4XRO 5 1377561600 36 LOVE this game! Some days I feel like Bingo some days I hear the Slots calling my name! People from all over the world playing 24 hours a day. It really is a small world afterall.
A11NWJ0J1AGDL2 B008JGSM6G 5 1355356800 34 This game is a spacial challenge. I have really enjoyed improving my skills with reasoning. Simple, yet challenging! I have to pay attention to time as I do tend to lose track when playing.
A11NWJ0J1AGDL2 B006QCMPWM 4 1328486400 28 Great graphics! I am really enjoying watching them breed and grow up. This would be a great way to teach small children about responsibility without any animals suffering.
A11NXK81MP6O33 B008YRVW0I 5 1356912000 26 It combines the peace of an aquarium with the challenge of an addictive game. The faster you okay the more you can buy for your aquariums.
A11NXK81MP6O33 B00CFNDUIY 4 1376265600 34 Enjoying the game. Wish gold was more plentiful, though. I enjoy all of the quests and the different areas of the game (saloon, farm, home, etc). I look forward to seeing what comes next.
A11NXK81MP6O33 B00BW08XRO 5 1369612800 22 A fun game of putting together food and serving customers. It looks great on my Fire and is simple to figure out.
A11NXK81MP6O33 B006HXUZJU 5 1357084800 24 I love Mahjong games and this one is a good one. I like the tiles and it keeps my attention for a long time.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00D1WA26Q 5 1383868800 28 The youngest children at my house love to play this one.  It is easy for them to navigate,And understand.Fills up time when it is time to wind down.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00AR1AUAW 5 1390089600 62 Enjoy looking for the words to match, several can work with each word.Could be they mean the same or opposites or words that we just usetogether often.  You play against yourself.  Gives how long it took you,but the next time you play the same one you can knock that numberdown as you get use to the words and what will match up.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00BJCM3S0 5 1397520000 40 This is a great game, at my house they love it. They like that they can draw lot scribble and erase and do something else. The colors are bright and fun, and all the colors of paper are great. Thanks.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00AE6XMHI 2 1397520000 25 I think my kids are a little too young for this one.  Older kids would enjoy it more.  We have six year olds and down.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00IF2JW8G 5 1395619200 20 This game was hard for my preschoolers, my nephews enjoy playing it and they are six years old and older.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00D4EBQ3E 5 1388793600 34 I enjoy the playing this game until I get hung up and can't come up with the answer.  Wish they would let you go on and come back later to the ones you missed.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00I8Q77Y0 2 1394668800 23 Flappy Wings is definetly a hard game, good for those who are play games seriously, but they like to watch the bird crash.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00AJ1EWRM 5 1388793600 30 The grandchildren have an Elf at their house for a month every year.They were excited to play the game with him and help to decorate thetree, over and over again.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00EBQRZBG 3 1383868800 32 Loved this type of game till you come up against one you get stuck on.....Game over....No going on, no clue,no anything...sometimes it makes for a short game. Wish they could fix that!!
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00E83G68K 2 1394668800 21 GRAPHICS AND COLORS ARE GREAT....BUT YOU NEED TO BUY  PRETTY MUCH TO PLAY. Not A GOOD CHOICE FOR CHILDREN. Too bad.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00E9A656K 2 1395619200 30 This game was a little beyond my kids age group, they did not try to play it very long, so it just sits.  Maybe when they get a little older.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B008IXP8IU 5 1394668800 43 This is a really good word game, and not real simple.  Some words are pretty easy and some are ones I have to look up in the dictionary to check meaning.  But all the letters are there for you so it is fun.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00A4EZ3QS 1 1394668800 24 They did not care for this game. The Candy swipe two was not so fun for them, they did not play it very much.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00EBQRSTK 4 1380067200 35 Just got this game today and the kids love it,as do I.  It keeps us all guessing,sometimes we play by ourselves and sometimes we play as a group, but it has us all engaged. Thanks!
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00IKZX1ZI 4 1395619200 29 The graphics and colors really grab the attention of the kids real fast.  They caught onto the game pretty quickly, also.They are having a great time playing this game.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00BWBHIUG 5 1397520000 37 I did not care for this game at first, I still get confused about how to do some things.  But as I continue to play I am picking up on what is happening, and enjoy playing now.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00EYIG5US 3 1383868800 20 I really like the game, but once you do not know one  person the game is over..you can't  continue....too bad!
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00GY0PQZ4 4 1394668800 21 Kids like this game, they like the different categories and searching for the words that are associated  with that category.  Enjoyable.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00GH6HTEG 5 1395619200 29 I am enjoying this one.  Good one to read a book with, or say my prayers with.and wind down to before going to bed.  Very soothing music,  Thank you.
A11O1ZHQPFHRG B00GY0HJ4K 3 1394668800 23 I HOPED JELLY SPLASH WOULD BE A GOOD GAME TO MATCH COLORS FOR PRESCHOOLERS, BUT IT IS A LITTLE TOO HARD FOR THEM.
A11O24TSKSMXZ6 B00CF6J2G0 4 1368576000 29 this game is all that i thought it would be. it . is a little  pricy. the  insects  are a good touch.  i am learning how to play it.
A11O24TSKSMXZ6 B00A4KVFLY 5 1356048000 23 this game is great.  I am loving every minute. what would make it the worlds greatest game is if you gave more coin.
A11O24TSKSMXZ6 B00785P2QC 3 1364428800 64 I enjoyed this game for about 2 years and got board and spent a great deal of money. About a week ago i got interested again about the game and discovered i had to start all over.  That really sucks what happen to my last game, the world may never know. Good game but i will not spend the money i use to spend.
A11O24TSKSMXZ6 B0086700CM 5 1340668800 23 this game is great it keep you on your feet stimulate your mind the turns and jump are in all the right places
A11O24TSKSMXZ6 B0063IH60K 5 1325030400 22 This game is wonderful. The movements are world class no waiting dosen't freeze while playing. thanks for making such a great game.
A11O7CW8KQ1ED9 B00AREIAI8 3 1373932800 80 Please read. If you are not devoted to using your real money to keep the horse healthy, then Don't get it. It gives you few coins and gems and they don't last long. You have to feed your horse healthy  food which costs lots of gems.  If you  want to waste your money on this silly app, fine. Just know that's money wasted on feeding a DIGITAL animal. Hey,it's pretty fun, but this app, it's costly once you get it.
A11O7CW8KQ1ED9 B00D3MWW44 5 1372809600 29 I love this game!!! The only problem I had was a few control problems. Other than that, so fun! There is even a polar bear for a fun option!
A11OB9FQ9RHTHH B0073V0FC2 1 1333152000 46 I thank this game is so lame you cant go up high because if you want to come down it is going to die also the tittle is lame also .......!!!!!! so I do not recamend it to anyone who is interested but resaults may very
A11OB9FQ9RHTHH B007DKC922 5 1332806400 43 I thank it is bore n as hell I do not recamend this game to you do not buy this you will be sorry the people who made this game are dumb asses O.K so do not buy you will waste your money
A11OB9FQ9RHTHH B0054JZC6E 5 1333843200 26 I love it I love it I loooovvveeee it it is giveing me 205000 free points just for doing what I'm doing now I LOVE IIIIITTTT
A11OE99P328CCC B00GCT92CU 5 1391731200 30 What a great way to work you brain and have fun doing it.  So far also not so tough that I have to spend a bunch of money getting clues
A11OE99P328CCC B00CRHF748 1 1389657600 30 You download the &#34;FREE&#34; game and then when you go to do a puzzle...each one is $2.99 to start.  So it is not a &#34;FREE&#34; game at all.I hate liars.
A11OE99P328CCC B00BX736EG 5 1393891200 24 Fun to play.  Makes you think and use your noggin.  A little tougher than the precursor.  Gotta keep thinking so the cobwebs don't gather.
A11OE99P328CCC B00CDBLC8S 5 1393286400 21 This is just plain fun.  I have truly been enjoying this game.  It helps push away these Michigan gloomy winter days.
A11OE99P328CCC B00FOW265Q 4 1391472000 25 Gets you thinking.  Not as simple as one might think.  It won't make you a rocket scientist but you can a have a good time
A11OE99P328CCC B00F24OV8G 5 1391385600 24 It's a fun way to work your brain.  Good way to pass the time.  Will continue to play gotta keep dementia at bay somehow.
A11OE99P328CCC B00GY0HJ4K 5 1392681600 25 This is a blast.  Nice change for a match three or more game.  Good game so far to let the children have some fun with.
A11OE99P328CCC B00D4EBQ3E 5 1392336000 24 Nice way to spend time on a gloomy cold day.  Definitely makes you think.  Great for travelling.  Probably good for children to build vocabulary.
A11OE99P328CCC B00GY0PQZ4 4 1387324800 25 Pretty Good  game so far.  Similar to a word search puzzle.  Granted have only completed a few levels;but so far so good.  Discontinue to play.
A11OG2Q6HX8ESN B004W4LMGQ 1 1318204800 25 There's a reason no other IM app asks for this permission. Send this developer a message. We won't put up with shoddy programming or spyware.
A11OG2Q6HX8ESN B004RJ6978 2 1321833600 24 It does not even sync. I would not spend any money on this when there are plenty of free list apps that do sync.
A11OH5JD97OU41 B00HFUNYWY 5 1392422400 35 This game is so much fun it is like a copy of star girl but even BETTER ! You can actually walk and go in cars u should realy get this game bye! : )
A11OH5JD97OU41 B00594XOZU 3 1397779200 54 Kik is a fast and great app. The only thing i hate about it is that somtimes it dosent work like with the typing and especially when it takes forever to get you on your page or your friends page it just stays white and you cant see anything or do anything about it.
A11OHDXPD643J8 B00DJFIMW6 5 1389139200 20 I love  this app. I love how you can change the outfits o  your minions. I love the fruit costume!!!!!
A11OHDXPD643J8 B00A3E2BVE 1 1378598400 23 I hate this app. It doesn't work at all. I tried many times to get it to work and I finally deleted it.
A11OHDXPD643J8 B00DUGCLY4 4 1405382400 25 This game is super fun and I play whenever I can crazy addictive!!!I would recommend this game to lots of people with a good review!
A11OHDXPD643J8 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1395014400 23 I love this game it is great to be able to continue to play flappy bird even when it's off the app store!!!
A11OK15TZQSBAQ B00A9JG6RS 2 1359763200 104 Annoying pop ups re purchasing more items to play longer, it requires too much effort to get back to game & I find it almost impossible to get past the stone birds. Also, it you don't have enough points to click on extra bars, mins etc, don't show me that screen. I have no intentions of buying through Amazon anything to make it possible to extend a game & would like to be able to disable that screen, unless I actually needed it. In short, I find it frustrating to have to continually exit these two screens in order to pay a relaxing game.
A11OK15TZQSBAQ B009UWME8U 4 1360800000 80 I really love this game. It really makes you think and stretch your mind. However it could be improved by not making you have to tap each turn to have the keyboard appear, if the already correctly selected letters automatically appeared on the &#34;Type Word&#34; line and the worse downer is the unintential hints that appear as you are typing a new word. Frequently the word you're looking for appears and they you feel like you have a cheat sheet.
A11OK15TZQSBAQ B0063M22QO 3 1377993600 30 Not very challenging but better than Mahjong II. I dont have 12 more words to discribe not challenging. I cant remember for sure but hope it was a free dowload.
A11OK15TZQSBAQ B007RDTICY 2 1377993600 136 I find playing various Mahjong games stimulating but also very relaxing. I already have several versions and decided that it was time for a new one.I assumed that Mahjong II meant the next level in complexity, as the first one was very easy to complete. I was greatly surprised that as soon as I had been through the various patterns I was constantly asked if I wanted new games. At 1st I thought that I was being referred to additional Mahjong games but no it was solitare, etc. I already have most of these games and prefer to pick out what I want not be pressured behind the scenes by misleading advertising. Frankly, Im more than disappointed with this embedded advertisement to purchase additional, non-related games, Im disgusted. I wonted even be opening this game again..
A11OK15TZQSBAQ B006M4F67A 4 1394064000 126 24/7 Games is an excellant name for this company, as that's how much  I could play this app. I have always enjoyed playing the various types of manning but could only give this app 4 stars. I could be wrong but I think there is one instance on the right hand side during one configuration that clearly is not blocked but will not offset when selected and on the left hand side the first row under the fish tail is so covered up that you have to guess at what tile is there. I have taken this into consideration and have just achieved three stars on the fish and can now move on to the next puzzle but it took many, many tries over many days.
A11OLN8TX1TZR3 B004SD5GZ4 5 1399766400 22 Everyone needs Adobe and it was very easy to install. I use it to download statements and other paperwork. Piece of cake.
A11OLN8TX1TZR3 B006SMEV9K 5 1400284800 54 Today I was out shopping and I wasn't sure if my husband like this flavor or the other or neither. So I looked this up and and poof it was there. I still haven't asked him yet, but I have it now. Now I need something to remind me of the note I saved........lol
A11OLN8TX1TZR3 B0055ILRN6 5 1400284800 21 When you have a limit on your Data, it is very helpful to have a Data Manager. This one works great.
A11OLN8TX1TZR3 B005ZFOOE8 5 1400284800 31 I have found Christian channels and they come in clear and a nice variety. It is wonderful having Christian music in the background. I am sure you will enjoy it too.
A11OP1TI0C6C76 B009G9KFQ0 5 1388880000 25 i recommend this app to use for the weather it tells you if it rains or snows great app to use on the kindle fire

A11OT75R7ZHDPJ B00GOZQ2E8 4 1397347200 20 Love how this game has started out. I can see myself spending many hours playing it. Try it out now!
A11OT75R7ZHDPJ B00DJFIMW6 5 1375747200 20 So much fun to run those minions! Good thing there are plenty of those yellow guys to run off cliffs!
A11OTU7XZ2G13R B004SOR4H6 5 1336348800 29 Finallllllly a version for Kindle Fire. :) I was using another app, that shows the photos without popping up. But even though I decided to use the official app.
A11OTU7XZ2G13R B007EC27QM 4 1336348800 20 Nice calculator for my Kindle Fire. It does what I need it to do and nothing more. Perfect for me.
A11OTU7XZ2G13R B0087TQYUG 5 1368576000 22 Scramble with friends is very addictive and great to play against friend. you wont get tired of this game. i loved it.
A11OTWLSDTKSEL B00992CF6W 5 1366416000 24 In my opinion, minecraft is the best game ever. My cuz and I made a lot of awesome stuff. I recommend minecraft to everyone.
A11OTWLSDTKSEL B008183CTE 5 1403568000 36 Play this game it is so awesome. I love it and most things I love are awesome.I think that anyone that understands at least the base principles of baseball could be an ace at this game.
A11OTWLSDTKSEL B00AIUUXHC 5 1387929600 21 *I said speechless*It's too awesome NOT to get. Try to eat humans on floats for lots of ptsTurtles are good too
A11P01P7I248OY B00CSR2J9I 5 1369180800 20 A very good but you can not get over the mountains but it is cool it good cars in it
A11P01P7I248OY B00ANT4OHS 5 1361232000 34 It is the best game ever and you will have to get it their is all I am giving it 5 I love it and you can go on amazon and get it to
A11P0NS3W9LGV B00CTQ6SIG 5 1401667200 71 I love the game but for I have a slow internet and there is a lot of big updates to it and they take a long time but still the game is one of the best build-up your city type of game on the kindle fire. A con is if you accidentally delete it all of your stuff will not save even if you redownload it because this happened to me.
A11P0NS3W9LGV B008M2WGRI 5 1370908800 52 It is the best Game on kindle.The only bad . Thing is you have to buy crystals if U want good stuff.Hint:If u have a growing potion press it beside the wall or edge of the map.And U go through the wall or out of the map where zombies Cant get u
A11P0NS3W9LGV B00I6IKSZ0 5 1403913600 33 I only like playing multiplayer but people constantly spawn kill and you can't do anything. They put people higher levels in your game. Coins are hard to get and everything cost a lot
A11P0NS3W9LGV B00992CF6W 5 1405209600 146 Minecraft is a really fun game where you survive, build a house, or fight monsters.There are two different modes on Minecraft,Survival,and Creative Mode.Creative mode is where you can fly and have anything you want unlimited.Survival is where you have to go around finding minerals and food to survive.You build your house get some wood or go mining. I prefer to go mining because it's fun and if you find something good it exites you. Plus in the new update they added infinite worlds, tame able dogs,New monsters,Redwood forest biome,Mesa biome,and much more. If you get lucky you go around the world searching and you could find a village. Villages are houses already built and they have NPC people walking around and they also have crops that you can get also. I would recommend this to anybody gamer or not.I hope this review helped a lot!  Thanks!
A11P0NS3W9LGV B00DJFIMW6 5 1379376000 25 If u Like temple run and despicable meIt's for uI LOVE IT ITS SO FUN LIKE TEMPLE RUN BEASTY SO SO BEASTY FOR MOST PEOPLE
A11P0Z1K8LS9IG B00CTQ6SIG 4 1374019200 49 This app is fun to play.  I would have given it 5 stars but the app is full of neat things that you have to pay money to get.  There might be $500 of extras they try to sell you in this game.  The game has no ads though.
A11P0Z1K8LS9IG B0058VW36U 4 1318723200 21 Only a few of the levels are challenging after you get the hang of it.  It's still fun to play though.
A11P0Z1K8LS9IG B00FATEJYE 5 1389657600 28 This app is really fun and I was pleasantly surprised how well it runs on the kindle fire hd.  It rarely lags and has not crashed even once.
A11P5FENZ75NVW B00B7Y0206 1 1384473600 44 This app sucks. Because it froze my tablet 2 times  f this game$$$!!!  #sucks like crap going to upgrade the app right know because it sucks .......sorry creater  that your game sucked make anew one that works next time . I hate the app
A11P5FENZ75NVW B00DS86XPM 5 1390867200 19 Yeah yeah love it so much..... Cool gameI love to draw so it was so cool to draw people
A11P5FENZ75NVW B006VXYEAW 3 1358899200 21 It makes me want to make donuts!!!!!!!!!!!$$$$$$$$$ love this game it is the best yum and yum. I want some donuts.
A11P9QK949TION B0084HDG8Y 5 1371254400 33 Love playing Black Knight. A youth misspent playing pinball in bars is rewarded with this great representation of the game. Responds just like the real thing. Except that you can't hip bump it.
A11P9QK949TION B009UWME8U 2 1371254400 27 You will notice after you play for a while- a short while- that there are a limited number of words. Not good even for a free app.
A11P9QK949TION B007S16X4Q 4 1371254400 23 Although if you play long enough, you'll notice you keep getting the same words. It's ok for free, though, so go for it.
A11P9QK949TION B0080H2TFE 5 1371254400 20 I had to force myself to stop playing for a week- I was that obsessed. Helps keep your mind sharp.
A11P9QK949TION B0066T8SDU 5 1371254400 59 My sister challenged me on Words with Friends, and I was consistently losing. This was on special for $.99 one day, so I grabbed it. After playing against the game, I am now soundly beating my sister almost every time- I have to let her win sometimes. I highly recommend this. It helps me with both words and strategy.
A11P9QK949TION B0093BM38O 1 1377475200 30 I don't mind the multiple choice so much, but it's the fact that the categories &amp; questions started to repeat on the second day! Not worth the money or coins.
A11P9QK949TION B0064X7B4A 5 1371254400 25 Love this for both the word challenge and the strategy challenge. Love that I can play my sister any time, no matter where we are.
A11P9QK949TION B00BUR9KJE 5 1371254400 22 Still fun to play after all these years. Now you don't need a live opponent, as you can play against the bot.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B0064ETS1I 2 1358035200 29 Downloaded this app for free when it was free app of the day. I played it for a few days but it gets really boring. Just not for me.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00FX6ZBXC 5 1393718400 46 So far i like this game much better than words with friends. I like the random opponent option so you don't need to rely on all your friends with playing. You also can play solo with tickets you can buy in the shop coins you earn.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00A9JG6RS 3 1359504000 60 This game was fun before i installed the update which caused game to continually crash, not load, or kept flashing facebook error (i was not using facebook with this game as you do not need too, or did not prior to update). Because of the errors from updating i uninstalled the app. I did send an error report as well.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B0094BB4TW 1 1398297600 79 How are we to navigate on this app when the update took all icons away?? I cant view my notifications or messages..i can't search facebook..i can't even get to my own profile page unless i find a post i made and click on my name and then i have nothing to tap to get back to the news feed! This app is now totally useless! If your previous version still works (mine was not functioning properly) Do not update!
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00AMRIZYY 5 1356739200 37 My 5 year old loves this dress up app on her kindle. She plays it frequently. It's a simple interface for her to use and has a nice selection for her to choose from. Nice vibrant colors.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00FB13Y74 3 1387756800 33 Its an okay game but my son is very disappointed its not compatible on his kindle fire device and if I did not own a fire hd we wouldn't be able to play.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00BW08XRO 2 1385251200 58 you only get the first level free..beyond that you have to buy the full game. to me, its not good enough to pay for, so after being disappointed when i reached the end of the first level and could go no further, i deleted the app. i wish app developers would add these details in their app descriptions.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00AH3B7X4 5 1356739200 45 My 5 year old daughter is loving these dress up apps! This and others by Shark Mobile are by far the nicest ones we have downloaded. She spends a long time creating new outfits and saving them. Nice simple layout/design, easy for all to use.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00IZLM8MY 2 1396742400 122 game would be fun if i liked everything about it and worked correctly. one problem..you need to link to facebook to complete some  tasks..fine, except every time i attempted to link to my account an error occurred and it won't. i just deleted this &quot;free&quot; game and here's why..there are some items you need to level up that you can only buy with real money and not the earned game coins...some items for sale have prices of $19.99-$49.99...are they crazy? the books for one..you need them to advance you character level..but when you run out the min to buy a few more is $1.99...to do this every time? sorry, i don't play &quot;free&quot; games that won't let you advance without real money.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00BXOAX40 2 1394323200 39 Seemed like a fun game the 3 times it actually opened for me. For 3 days following, the app would get stuck on the loading screen. Apps that refuse to work get promptly deleted and this was no exception.
A11PBH0Y3OJ7HD B00AP9U8SA 5 1356912000 23 My girls and i love these dress up games. Very nice app that keeps them busy. Good amount of things to choose from.
A11PE9OLV8KJP5 B008194C74 5 1373587200 23 Love this game.  It is so addicting that you will lose track of time.  I would recommend it for anyone doing &#34;Brain Training&#34;.
A11PE9OLV8KJP5 B00DUZKE4O 3 1376179200 21 Very short game.  Can be completed in a few, short sessions.  Some movies were obscure and not likely to be guessed.
A11PFXB23SR1PK B00B2V66VS 4 1359417600 26 It's really fun but I like temple run better because u can swipe faster although there is ziplines and cheaper players it's still cool!!!I love it!!:p
A11PFXB23SR1PK B004S3MB2U 5 1362528000 33 Get it the actual price is 9.99 and its free n works fine on my kindle fire hd and my friend bought it but get it free that's all I need to say
A11PHBTHSZFZZ5 B00FB13Y74 4 1389139200 21 Angry Birds is now mobile and ready to race. Children love this game and I enjoy that it keeps them busy.
A11PHBTHSZFZZ5 B008XG1X18 5 1389139200 43 I enjoy Pinterest so much. I can find anything on there. At first I was not sure how to use or even know that much about it, but now I look up everything!  I have already learned so much interesting things. Really recommend!
A11PHBTHSZFZZ5 B00AIUUXHC 5 1389139200 21 I really enjoy being a shark and gobbling up everything. This game is tons of fun. Even my children love it!
A11PIBBSMAYIBA B008PPGFZG 4 1366588800 50 I love this app for my Kindle. It works great. You don't get the full application like I have on my IPHONE but it works well enough. You can only browse so many photos before it won't allow you to view anymore, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
A11PIBBSMAYIBA B008XG1X18 5 1366588800 20 Works really well with my Kindle. Easy to use and I haven't noticed any glitches. I would recommend this application.
A11PIBBSMAYIBA B0094BB4TW 4 1366588800 23 This app works really well with my Kindle Fire. I would recommend the Free download. Has the same capabilities as my phone application.
A11PIBBSMAYIBA B005HSL626 5 1366588800 29 I love playing this Free game and so do my kids. My son loves playing this game and it is free with the option of purchasing the full game.
A11PJLQ5BJ5VEK B00FRM93FE 5 1390003200 37 This is a really great game. It's easy to play and very fun. The only down side is that it's kind of short. I can't wait for the next one. And it doesn't require any weird permissions.
A11PJLQ5BJ5VEK B00GI8AMI8 5 1404864000 25 A great point and click game. Not too difficult with great graphics and audio. It is kind of short though. I can't wait for more!
A11PJLQ5BJ5VEK B00JND1LQW 3 1400112000 35 This is a pretty fun game that requires thinking and timing. I did not like the notification that it puts in the notification bar begging me to play it. To me, that is a no-no.
A11PK028D3DSC B007PT3QOQ 3 1335312000 20 really like this game but the time glitch is anoying. if fixed this game would get 5 stars from me!
A11PK028D3DSC B0080JD59G 4 1348012800 33 I really enjoyed this game. if u like hidden object games with adventure then this one is for you. keep them coming, I'm starting to run out of good ho games to play.
A11PK028D3DSC B0081TYN7S 4 1346544000 24 I really like this game! hidden object games are my fav... keep them coming! hidden object games with adventure and Minni games are fun.
A11PK2GEUB1J3H B006PK2TEE 5 1327104000 27 This game has like 100 different catorgories that you can choose from. Even after you. have finished all of the themes, you can still play different wordsearches.
A11PK2GEUB1J3H B0054JZC6E 3 1325980800 47 Some games work, others do not. You start out with 10 games and then you have get points to unlock others. Some games are really hard, but others you can beat with little pratice. A few are impossible, because they have to do with flicking your finger.
A11PK2GEUB1J3H B006RC0ZP0 3 1327104000 21 This game is like fruit ninja, but instead of slicing fruit, you pop fish. Very funny time waster. I like it.
A11PK2GEUB1J3H B004GYYQLA 4 1328054400 49 people are whining over this beacause something is wrong with it. up. First of all, you don't have to sign up for it anyway. Second, I have had this for over two months and I have only seen a couple ads. Overall, great app to pass your time with.
A11PLGY0TRFFL1 B0086700CM 5 1338163200 23 now that put out this app!!!!! im sooo happpy!!!!!! ive wanted temple run for like, forever and now i have it!!!! Yeah!!!! (:
A11PLGY0TRFFL1 B007XKEY6Q 1 1335571200 34 i purchased the kindle fire edition of draw something 1 week ago for $1.99 and now its FREE??? THATS A RIPOFF!! I am SO MAD @ Amazon for putting the expensive one out first!!!
A11PLGY0TRFFL1 B006MH1A1S 5 1327795200 23 This game is fun, fastpaced, and exciting! I am very happy that I downloaded this app! I hope that you download it, too!
A11PLGY0TRFFL1 B004LOMB2Q 5 1336694400 41 i really like this app! with this app it is easy to jot down a quick reminder or note.  you can also create lists! rhis os a great app for notes, lists, and even diary entries!! have fun withthis cool app!
A11PMXURIH3A39 B00A1SL8SE 4 1358553600 79 when to spin, how rapidly,  where to freeze or when to thaw... the controls are simple to understand and to use. The challenge is when to utilize them. Unlimited attempts to solve the puzzle is a must for some of us. Don't poke anyone's eyeball out! Only gave it a four star as I won't keep it on my kindle fire (1st gen) for long periods at a time. Very few apps find a permanent place on my kindle.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B007NACZPI 5 1332806400 39 Love the villagers! This is the best of all of build a civilization type games I have ever played. Could use a bit more guidance for a tutorial, but I have truly never enjoyed one more than Tiny Village.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B0088QGB7Y 5 1369094400 44 the graphics are delightful and the village is warmly inviting. It is easy to to earn game coinage and experience to advance the game. It is non-linear and does not require leagal tender to enjoy. I wish more of my friends were playing it!
A11PMXURIH3A39 B007BFSYMS 5 1361232000 167 I thought my wife would be able to use this, never knew I would benefit directly from a white noise machine. It comes preloaded with a variety of noises and several more offered for free download on their website. The loading of the web offered files was quick and seamless, I didn't have to do anything save to select the well described audio files. You can select favorites, mix files for a personal touch and set the length of time the audio will play. It's fabulous! I choose my mix file, put my (first gen) Kindle Fire in sleep mode and drift off to sleep hearing the pleasingly gentle lapping of the waves on the shore, owls hooting and a campfire crackling. So much more restful than hearing the television in the next room. If you need a white noise generator or would like one to use in meditation, this app is more than worth checking out. I use it every night and it is very soothing.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B00ATDOVNK 4 1359072000 55 Personally I prefer more hidden object mini games; the ability to play the varied hidden object sites from the main screen AND play a domino solitaire during the HO mini games or skip if too difficult is a generous boon from the creators.  Thank you, the game is up there with the best I've played.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B007P6T52G 5 1338336000 86 This is my ultimate fav game type. It's not too easy, but simple to play. Play is not ridgedly linear, you have some decent room for individual choices from the very start. You DO have to have friends to visit and invite to your isle to progress the game. If Feint does make it possible to request items on their site it will be more easily enjoyed. At this point the Kindle Fire cannot mesh with FB. Hopefully this will one day be rectified. {hint, hint}
A11PMXURIH3A39 B008IXP8IU 4 1349654400 46 So, I have some memory issues, a great deal of confusion and a dislike of timed games. This is a wonderful game with a couple of ways to mix it up a bit. The only drawback is having to buy the extra sets of game data.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B00AA87JGU 4 1356220800 54 If you enjoy locked room puzzles you will enjoy this app. It starts simply and gradually becomes more challenging. If you get stuck, simply bypass that room, no need to use cheats or walkthroughs. if you have never tried a locked door puzzler, then give it a trial. Free is a very generous gift.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B0050KEVO6 5 1327276800 30 This was always the best part of some video games. Having the ability to create items without having to fight my way to a swamp and back is a delight.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B004MC8CA2 4 1329264000 80 This application is fantastic with so many choices of Bibles and study reading options. It is not a guided study app, however. There are no questions or thought provoking essays provided, my wife found this as a serious drawback and I wish there was some way to easily find this option, also. No one application can hope to cover the broad expanse of religious belief, this one can provide a way to bring the reader to the door of knowledge.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B004JZBGWI 4 1330732800 52 I was once the king of checklists, but use this fantastic app for the calendar functions. I can track appt times and dates as well as have a list of what to bring or do to prepare for same. Color coding the notes keeps everyone's schedule easily trackable. Use this app daily!
A11PMXURIH3A39 B008B88LEU 5 1361232000 74 Simple but not easy!! If I was restricted to only five apps on my kindle fire this would be one of them. I gladly paid for unlimited turns and have only regret. I wish the grid was larger. &lt;sigh> I am delighted with the app and how well it performs. The game play is simple and the tutorial covers everything you need to know to begin. The hard part of this game is stopping.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B009RLG7RI 4 1386288000 79 I would give this a 5 star rating if it was longer, more difficult and had better instructions. I thoroughly enjoyed the game and DID continue to play the app after completing the goals. I am always looking for new city building games that are not based on warfare; this is a winner. I actively seek match 3 games as well and this game has power ups to earn as well as 'game coinage ' to create pioneer towns.
A11PMXURIH3A39 B00AO5WLIU 3 1364169600 91 The awkward layout is the norm for England's crossword puzzles, this is an issue for many reviewers. The layout can be disconcerting for those familiar with American style crossword puzzles. I, too, experienced input issues. I didn't play long enough to trigger ads, apparently, as I didn't experience that frustration. Hmmm, Amazon gives smaller/younger developers a chance for greater exposure to the consumer, decent gesture from a giant company. I approve in theory AND practise. Why the whimpering about a service that is a GIFT to the consumer, free. Hello? Really?
A11PMXURIH3A39 B00BUQBQN8 5 1371081600 110 How could I NOT absolutely love this app! There is no way I could find fault with a sleek app making it easy to scan the Etsy marketplace for products and follow the business owners/creators of those items I particularly prefer. I personally prefer using this app to going to my isp, going on the web, going to my bookmarks and then opening the Etsy site. I found the app fairly easy to learn to operate and can peruse the marketplace in those minutes between activities here at home. I am a handicrafter and enjoy supporting other crafters and small business owner/operators. This app makes visiting Etsy easier and faster.
A11PNCL3OODWBH B00846GKTW 5 1337817600 24 it is the best game ever if u love dress up games. or a fitly girl all I am saying is download this app
A11PNCL3OODWBH B005ZFOOE8 5 1333929600 30 it is a great app u r able to create ur own stations listen to live stations the only catch is if u don't ave facebook it will mot work
A11PQ1A4VFSH6X B00B0419YG 5 1373932800 22 Awesome game. I want more!! This is great for all ages!  Hope the sequel comes out soon. This is a must play.
A11PR2XJYRSOTZ B005HPIO88 2 1327363200 128 to find something likable about this app. It was a challenge. When my rugrat was 2 he enjoyed a &quot;tap the dots&quot; app which taught him the sequence of numbers. This one highlights the next number, which I think takes away even the speck of potential for educational value. On the upside, the number IS announced as you touch it, although in a gratingly annoying voice. The touch-to-color may be somewhat entertaining for the very young.I thought the FAOTD was a chance for unknown developers to have a chance at discovery. The best way to do THAT is to feature apps that appeal to a wide audience. I'm afraid that &quot;2 yr olds, the mentally disabled and elderly and/or dementia patients&quot; is not quite a wide enough audience.
A11PR2XJYRSOTZ B00IZJLRQE 4 1405382400 34 This is the first tap-style game I've played. The graphics and music are cute and the controls are very responsive. It will probably take me a while to get accustomed to the process, though.
A11PR2XJYRSOTZ B004S2FUH4 4 1334188800 81 This saves a few minutes of my time, which makes it a worthy app. I really like the bill-split w/tip calculations. It uses simple language and functions.  It'll be great on my primary screen for quick calculations.The 1 star whiners obviously have more time on their hands than is healthy. If time is money, how much have we all blown on this? I feel the 45 seconds i've spent to submit this review is worth it because I GAVE A REVIEW.
A11PRSJD8V0R2H B00964BWFS 5 1386633600 21 This is for relaxing. An easy but still changing match game that allows you to make an aquarium without the upkeep.
A11PRSJD8V0R2H B004SBS8LA 5 1378339200 27 Great to rescue others in trouble, and monkeys are just right for the others. Good graphics and color, action is good. This one is best so far.
A11PRSJD8V0R2H B009G9KFQ0 5 1390867200 46 Except for the live photos it hasn't been too far off. Love the extra days and the hourly reports as it lets me plan bait better. But the weather is gonna be unpredictable no matter what people say, there will be changes that happen sometimes suddenly.
A11PRSJD8V0R2H B009WO7NQO 3 1356998400 24 I enjoyed seasons much more than this one, but it is something new to play at times. Easier than some others and more relaxing.
A11PSJMRABGZLZ B0054JZC6E 5 1360800000 22 It's an in between stuff game, something to do when you're bored, or waiting. Don't like the new Valentine's day background though.
A11PSJMRABGZLZ B00A04GA14 5 1359936000 24 This game is awesome. Seriously. I'm picky, too. It has good graphics and a pretty cool story. Bombing. Breast results fifth breath noble butter.
A11PSRQB3LNTPC B00AIUUXHC 5 1396483200 41 This is the best game ever u have to get it. I'm not kidding.it is so fun to eat humans u have to get it.yeah I'm 9 so that doesn't mean I don't know a good game when I see it.
A11PW5F0OPYYXC B009O2XY12 3 1356220800 20 it's ok gets redundant after awile but for free it's decent and gives me some thing to do. The End.
A11PW5F0OPYYXC B009PSV1HE 2 1358812800 20 downloaded it but found it redundant and frustrating after a while. removed it after a few games. not for me.
A11PW5F0OPYYXC B00A9JG6RS 2 1358812800 21 downloaded the game. it was ok for a while but found it less than challenging after a while. not my favorite.
A11PZSMLJVJ3WP B0061S5NNO 5 1383609600 26 Works well and lets you access many different restaurant's menus for calorie counting.  Makes keeping your totals each day easy!  Can't get much simpler than this.
A11PZSMLJVJ3WP B008OOYALE 5 1362182400 24 Love figuring out the different dragons and how to cross breed them.  Find it challenging and addicting!  Love the interaction with my neighbors too.
A11PZSMLJVJ3WP B0064TVQ5E 5 1346371200 20 I can play it for hours and hours!  I find it challenging for my mind and enjoy it very much!
A11PZSMLJVJ3WP B008JGSM6G 4 1362960000 28 This is a great way to pass the time and also work your mind at the same time.  Would reccomend to anyone who enjoys working the brain out.
A11Q1ZU46QSSMW B004Z9ZNTK 1 1319932800 56 for the 5 seat review below please don't insult us. we can clearly see you are the developer..the controls and touch sensitivity is down right uncontrollable. not even worth a free download. Amazon must choose things at random cause clearly no one pre played this to see if it was up to some sort of standards.
A11Q1ZU46QSSMW B0085VR7WU 2 1341273600 67 nice interface but a couple of problems. I have played other farkle games and even play at home with real dice. this version feels like it wants you to lose more often then not so at some point you have to buy chips and energy.also sometimes it does not give you winnings.I am really tired of games that are slanted to make you purchase in game stuff..
A11Q5DZ1BH8DH5 B00BUIPN62 5 1364169600 25 This is one of the best games in my kindle fire hd. It is a game that everyone should have on their kindle fire hd.
A11Q5DZ1BH8DH5 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1373155200 29 This app is amazing!!! I really liked it in my ipod and know its in my kindle fire hd!!!! Really thankful that amazon gave this app to the store.
A11Q5DZ1BH8DH5 B00DJFIMW6 5 1373241600 23 this game is awesome I never thought that amazon was gonna bring this app to the appstore.really good game I like the minions
A11Q5DZ1BH8DH5 B00BWA8BAS 5 1376179200 23 very great app. I really like it. Its one of the best apps. it is worth the dollar and it is very addictive.
A11Q5DZ1BH8DH5 B00BTYP6QE 5 1374019200 20 I have all cut the rope games and I love them all its defenitly fun and in a low price!!
A11Q5DZ1BH8DH5 B00AB7HESI 5 1368748800 33 I love this app I used to have it in my ipod touch but then I becamed a kindle fan and I love it it is awesome in my kindle fire hd 7
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B008FRA5LY 5 1391817600 20 we enjoy this game and have fun playing. The graphics are better than some other Logo Quiz games we've played
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B0063HB1HU 5 1391817600 21 We love Reader's Digest and am happy with the Kindle version. Great articles and ways to cross reference - would recommend
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B009SDHIPK 4 1392508800 43 my nephews downloaded this app and had a lot of fun playing the game. I didn't play it firsthand, so can't give a personal review, but they are video game buffs, so I would be confident is saying that it's a decent game
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B007XKEY6Q 4 1391817600 22 This is a fun app to play with friends. Downloading it on the kindle is easier to draw versus on your smartphone
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B0064TVQ5E 5 1391817600 28 For people who like Mahjong. Simple and fun, with multiple levels of difficulty. This is a classic style Mahjong so the tiles take some time getting used to
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B008NMT684 4 1392508800 22 downloaded for my toddler son and he liked the graphics. Would recommend for younger children (18mo+) not bad for a free app
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B0089Z3D02 4 1392508800 28 I have played the pogo game on my desktop and this app is very similar. can play most of the games that you can access on the computer
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B006PJ3UKC 5 1391817600 21 This is a great newspaper app, we enjoy USA Today and easy to gain the news and filter stories. Would recommend
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B007NZRKF8 2 1391817600 27 concentration game I've played. Very basic and a little boring. there are other concentration games on the market that have better graphics and more fun to play
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B0086700CM 2 1391817600 30 I'm probably one of the only people who don't enjoy Temple Run, but I can't stand this game.  I can see why it's popular, but not my cup of tea.
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B004K4RY9M 4 1392508800 23 good word search app, different levels of difficulty and pretty straightforward for what the app is. would recommend for anyone who enjoys wordsearch
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B005MKRVLE 3 1391817600 22 This is a fun game and good for people who like Sodoku puzzles. Different degrees of difficulty make it fun and challenging
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B004R7L4JS 4 1392508800 21 this is a fun app for puzzles and brain teasers. some of the puzzles are difficult, but definitely worth the effort.
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B008N8IV2U 1 1391817600 32 I played this a couple of times and had no idea on how to advance or play the game. I didn't spend much time on it, so can't give a great feedback
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B004JZBGWI 3 1391817600 27 Cute way to store notes, do not use as much as I could - I still find it easier to write on an actual post it :)
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B008CPZNL6 5 1391817600 21 This is an awesome app for those who want gain insight on the social media world. Would highly recommend this program
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B008JK6W5K 5 1391817600 29 This is a fun game and we play this together as a couple. Some of the graphics we have never seen so it's fun to figure out the companies
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B006P57MUK 1 1391817600 20 didn't really use this application, I found that renting from Amazon directly is better since they have the same titles
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B004DLPXAO 5 1392508800 25 if you love to read, you need the kindle app on your device. easy to purchase and rent books from the library - awesome app
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B007ZGO7EM 5 1391817600 29 Simple to use, it's pretty straight forward and is a calculator. Would recommend if you need a calculator on your Kindle, the graphics are big and easy to see
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B00A757EFW 4 1392508800 32 this is a classic game, not bad for a kindle device but takes some getting used to. Would recommend for anyone who has the urge to play pac-man every now and again
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B006OBWGHO 4 1391817600 35 This is a fun game and addictive. It is difficult as the game progresses so wouldn't recommend to any parent who see the Disney tag and think it's an ok app for anyone too young
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B004TI2ZXY 5 1391817600 21 this application. I'm a die hard Mapquester and love this version. You can detour while en route and easy to use
A11Q7PYQ87R5Y2 B005ZXWMUS 1 1391817600 38 we don't use this app since we've found that it's easier to download videos from Amazon directly. Can see the allure if you're already a netflix client, but not going to jump ship since we're happy with Amazon
A11QD7GL1AEV67 B004HXHVZ8 5 1404432000 2 Nice app
A11QD7GL1AEV67 B008J4K6KI 5 1404432000 2 Nice game
A11QD7GL1AEV67 B008BTX2CA 5 1404432000 1 Nice
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B00HYL0AAI 5 1404518400 26 I am enjoying this game very much.  The graphics are very clear and they make the games fun to play.  I recommend this game for all.
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B007TBAQCK 5 1385078400 21 The graphics are great.  I just wish the bonuses were only 1 or 2 hours apart rather than 4 hours apart.
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B00IU61TPQ 5 1398556800 25 I have really enjoyed this game.  The graphics are very good and play progresses smoothly.  I have recommended it to a lot of my friends.
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B00H343YNQ 5 1390003200 32 1Up casino slots has great graphics.  I just wish the minimum bets were smaller so that I could play longer without buying extra coins since I try to play within my means.
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B00D3ULE1I 5 1395705600 21 I've been playing this slot game for a LONG time and have enjoyed it tremendously.  Thanks for the years of enjoyment.
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B00GTXFOIA 5 1387411200 24 wow I've never seen such a pig or sheep before.  the game. moves quickly it is fun. I am looking forward to playing more.
A11QDJG87JR2U0 B00E616R5Q 5 1384473600 20 Awesome game.  But I do not like the snakes in Aphrodite.  Blizzard &amp; Kings &amp; Aphrodite are my favorite games.
A11QGOTGR2A5Q3 B00CD6R17O 2 1384819200 25 Pay table tells you nothing. Wheels not particularly interesting. It is free,  however, so if you just want to kill time it's an okay app.
A11QGOTGR2A5Q3 B00ADPH2YO 1 1384473600 24 There are better free games out there with more interesting play.  The sound is not very appealing either. Don't bother to waste your time.
A11QGOTGR2A5Q3 B007SYXJXG 1 1367798400 35 All this app does is let you program your DVR to record a program if you forget. I have not tried it away from home to see if it works. Not worth my time, really.ok
A11QGOTGR2A5Q3 B00CNT8KW6 4 1384992000 31 Love the fairies and how she becomes a wild card. Not too fond of second level though. Easy to play and win with the free money. Overall, one of my favorites.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B00F8H0LM2 3 1398297600 33 I don't like having to buy extra booster for the game. it can get pretty expensive. It defeats the purpose of having a cute game on a tablet. it is so under powered.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B0063GORYU 4 1398297600 36 If you are a card game player, and puzzle solver, it is a good game. it is pretty well done and easy to play once one gets the hang of it. i would say get it.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B004SBX112 4 1398297600 33 Fun little game. Good graphics,  I don't like having to buy extra booster for the game. it can get pretty expensive. It defeats the purpose of having a cute game on a tablet
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B00F8GYC1Y 3 1398297600 46 I have not tried it but, even though I purchased them together.  if it is as under powered as the first I will still hate paying an extra 14 dollars to purchase extra boosters. For a kid it can get expensive for a 4 dollar game.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B004SD5GZ4 4 1398297600 25 It is one of the better  pdf  readers, a multi- platform necessity on computers,  tablets, pdas, cellphones,  All in all, necessary  part of computing today.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B005V1N71W 4 1398297600 20 it is a pretty well done piece, performs well at parties or finding other genre that matches your listening pleasure.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B004SJ3BCI 3 1398297600 33 fun little game. Good graphics,  I don't like having to buy extra booster for the game. it can get pretty expensive. It defeats the purpose of having a cute game on a tablet
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B0094BB4TW 4 1398297600 20 Nothing to write home to mom about. It works as it is advertised. For Tablet application it is just fine.
A11QHTF7M4RZL5 B008UXIDYE 5 1398297600 26 It is a excellent reference app. It is well done well worthy of a place on your tablet. A student of the Bible, needs this app.
A11QPX19XGEYBZ B00A70ZHQ0 3 1389225600 23 Did not really play this enough to give a true rating, don't want to judge it unfairly, might try again in the future
A11QPX19XGEYBZ B00AK2RHR2 5 1389225600 28 I love this game, it helps me to exercise my brain and eyes! It keeps me motivated to stay active by challenging me to keep up the speed.
A11QSIQ9XWQAKA B00EXVZW6E 3 1381622400 39 I like the seek and find games with a story behind it better.  The difficulty was average.  I'm glad I got it as the free app of the day because i would not typically spend my money on this.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B00FAPF5U0 5 1382227200 49 I've been waiting for a long time for Candy Crush to be available on Kindle Fire and it's finally here and as great as I expected it to be.  Absolutely one of the best (and most addictive) games - if you haven't played, you're missing a LOT of fun!
A11QWUA100WXP1 B005J80RTW 4 1376438400 37 I love this addicting game but my player stats have stopped updating.  I keep getting the message 'retrying score push'.  all of my previous stats are gone and when you've played thousands of games, it's pretty disappointing.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B008JJS6D2 3 1394236800 38 This would be a fun bingo game if you could play more often.  As it is, you hardly get any credits and you have to wait 24 hours for the.  Puhleeese - wish the developer wasn't so stingy.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B006MI4JEM 5 1365206400 30 A combination of scrabble, tetris, and bubble shooter!  A good mind puzzler - fun to see how many words you can make and if you can keep beating your scores.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B0066T8SDU 4 1361145600 51 I got this specifically for the single player option.  It's not too bad, but I've beaten the computer almost every time and I'm not THAT good!  But, it's still fun and helps me hone my skills.  It's also nice not to have to wait for someone else to make a move.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B00910Y1OQ 3 1352246400 25 this game keeps me occupied.  fairly challenging just not real exciting.  fine for FAOTD but if I had paid for it I'd probably feel cheated.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B006P0A5KO 1 1351987200 50 I loved chapter 1 free version, but chapter 2 is a bait and switch.  You can only play a few levels and then it expects you to buy the upgrade.  Don't bother downloading the free version but I'm not going to buy the full one just because of their ploy.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B0089Z3D02 3 1351641600 36 limited but ok but something happened and now all I get is the initial screen and when I try to select a game it goes back to my app library.  What happened?  (on kindle fire) .
A11QWUA100WXP1 B00COQTZLS 2 1387324800 87 I'm looking for a simple app to keep track of my activities and this one isn't it.  There are NO instructions on how to use this app and I can't add anything - contacts, meetings, not a thing.  It keeps wanting to sync with something but I don't have anything elsewhere to sync.  Apparently this is not a 'free - standing' app, which is what I'm looking for.  Good thing it was the FAOTD or I'd be really upset (actual cost is $9.99).  I'm deleting this immediately.
A11QWUA100WXP1 B00E5GJ7QS 2 1402963200 46 I have no patience with games that don't provide any information and this is one of them.  I also have no patience with games that don't work right and this is one of them.  Even as a free game, don't waste your time.  I'm uninstalling immediately.
A11QX2TTWOP2Z2 B00IZMQ8G0 4 1396224000 24 This game is very good for kids. The reason for why I gave this game four stars is because you need energy to play.
A11QX2TTWOP2Z2 B00FATEJYE 5 1386028800 21 It takes to long to download but it has good graphics.It also has all kinds  of DC super heroes and villains.
A11QX2TTWOP2Z2 B00BFWY2KG 4 1396742400 24 This app is good but please add direct tv. Besides that everything else is perfect. I love this app. It is a good app.
A11QYNXLFT3XVY B00FGFVMGA 5 1388361600 54 The game is short... a few hours... and not overly challenging.  If you get stuck, there is a hint Magnifiying glass. Click it a second time and it will show the solutions.  But the graphics are so pretty.  Many of the puzzles reminded me of the Nancy Drew games from Herinteractive.  Worth the $.99.
A11QYNXLFT3XVY B009C7ZQM4 5 1390003200 63 I hate it when I download an app and have to send 5 hours figuring out how it works. This app is easy to use, does its job quickly and gives me the options on what changes I make and what I do. It shows me the results as I clean or boost memory, which are the two features I use it for.
A11QYNXLFT3XVY B00EOGZ42U 2 1388361600 58 Maybe if I just stuck with things longer, this would have turned out to be the greatest game in history.  But the part I played involved seeds (that little rocket shaped thing on the logo) watching those seeds fly around a blue ball (planet) planting those seeds to grow a tree and get more seeds.  I gave up.
A11QYNXLFT3XVY B007MPJQ38 4 1389139200 180 My husband and I played this game together one night instead of watching a video, and it made a nice change. The graphics are nice and the game plays out in parts... first exploring the mansion with its secret rooms, then the gardens and finally the lab. The puzzles kept us guessing and working together, but between the two of us, we were never stumped long.  But they were hard enough we felt when we solved some of them that we had accomplished something. There is a hint option but we didn't use it. The game took us about two hours, a few cookies and a sleeve of crackers to finish. There isn't so much a mystery to solve as a challenge to find the doctor. The only thing that keeps it from getting five stars is we weren't sure what exactly was going on at first. You figure that out as you play. But for $.99 it was a great &amp;#34;date night&amp;#34; activity... When the roads are icy and you don't want to stick your head outside until spring.
A11QYNXLFT3XVY B00EGY1WN0 4 1394496000 46 I like getting new books.  This app makes it easy.  Everyday it lists New free books. You can customize it to ask it to include or exclude certain genre's. It also shows you the Amazon star rating and draws your attention to books that score high.
A11QYNXLFT3XVY B006P4FBUE 4 1389052800 217 This is a fun app to play around with. The keys are small and I found it almost impossible to chord on the double levels.  The sound is good for the piano and the handbells, not as hot for the others. It will play a drumbeat and you can slow down, speed up or change the beat like a regular keyboard. You can select songs from a songbook and have the keys you need to touch highlighted or you can have it demonstrate the song for you. In learning mode, it will chord for you while you play with one finger... which is nice since chording is hard on the tiny screen...but if you want to add a little extra flurish here or there, it won't understand and continues cchording to the way it thinks you should be playing. Still, Amazing Grace played slowly on the piano is nice. This is more of a play around with it app. You will never play great or even remotely complex pieces on it, but for simply one finger type stuff, it is fun.  I imagine kids will have fun with it and $.99 for a toy to amuse them for a while so you can get stuff done isn't a bad investment... and it works without internet... so bonus!!!!!!
A11R26B0T6AN2L B00BWBHIUG 5 1372032000 40 If you try to update an it says PARSE ERROR don't uninstall this app it can be fixed. If you uninstall then reinstall you start at square one. It isn't an amazon issue it is Google changing your app setting.
A11R26B0T6AN2L B00ET0PZDO 5 1389657600 21 Totally enjoyable it saves your progress and makes you think outside of the box can't wait to try more of them
A11R26B0T6AN2L B00H0BGCJK 5 1392163200 56 This is a super cool app. that I can't put down. It kind of reminds me of a type of monster rancheri use to play on the ps.  If anyone wants to be my friend my code is:  AY8AK8.  Also, if you need a clan our code is:  XAQAR999.  LOVING this game hope you do too.
A11R49ZCFZLZ7U B00IZQOZB6 5 1401321600 35 To start off ill say the bad things about this. The controls could be a bit better, but that's just me so don't hate. Good job Glu you did a good job on this game.
A11R49ZCFZLZ7U B00CKJ2KK2 5 1396742400 21 Even though I haunt played it there's a minor flaw it won't let me play it but I bet it's good
A11R4Q807QEVTU B00G6ZTM3Y 5 1387929600 19 it's awesome get it now believe me get it nowIT'S  AWESOME GET IT NOW BELIEVE ME GET IT NOW
A11RB3A3TH31S8 B004HE5TAG 4 1332201600 34 this app is simple and fun. graphics are good and instructions were easy to read.  not a lot of bells and whistles and couldn't get advice button to work but still enjoy the game
A11RB3A3TH31S8 B008DM4OTA 3 1355097600 21 It's good for the kids but with all the computer games out there for kids, this one was just too simple.
A11RBKMJ1O6YE3 B0088QDDDY 5 1344902400 29 soooooo fun. best game ever.challanging at first. but great after. btw give wine to mom then you can go up stairs. btw2 the brother is the hardest to do
A11RBKMJ1O6YE3 B00G5LQ5MU 3 1387843200 21 this is a fun game but its also challenging... you have to unlock the hints to win but over all fun
A11RBKMJ1O6YE3 B007MFEESK 4 1337299200 38 I loved it! just add something so you can look up people by User names. because if you want to look for some one or see if their on, you should be able to. over great great stuff!
A11RBKMJ1O6YE3 B008Y7SMQU 5 1348099200 24 I 100% love this game. so fun. its amazing how much we know when we don't know. lolz. but really great game. 6 stars
A11RBKMJ1O6YE3 B00DJFIMW6 3 1383350400 43 I love this game, but it will not work on my kindle fire. When you get to the home screen, it freezes up, causing me to reset my kindle. But this game works on my other tablets fine. Just not for my kindle
A11RM80MYCG2W3 B007TO3JW6 4 1357344000 52 These slots are fun. If you play smart, you can accumilate over 1 mil credits over time. Some slots pay off better than others. Ads r not invasive. New free credits every 4 hrs.  I have this app on several devices. Have fun. Did not give 5 stars because nothing is perfect.
A11RM80MYCG2W3 B004HGK6FW 4 1356652800 45 Enjoy this app. Have it on my dumbphone too. Seems to work well on kindle fire. Nocrash or force close.The ads are not intrusive while playing and the number keys are easily used. Would give a five star but I have only played 4 games.
A11RM80MYCG2W3 B00CWY76CC 5 1382313600 35 Nice game. Graphics are good and simple. The challenges a person to search for items to either open to find tools or pass codes to solve puzzles. Great time passer and ready for more levels
A11RMC4DI2LAGD B00G357N92 4 1387584000 20 I think this game is okay. It is fun but it takes awhile to get spoons for the kitchen aids.
A11RMC4DI2LAGD B008JGSM6G 5 1378771200 23 fun but a little bit too easy but overall fun fun game I love it so much get this game I mean app
A11RMC4DI2LAGD B00FOW265Q 4 1388707200 58 this is a good game if you need to pass time some puzzles are hard but overall its fun nut you need to remember this is not like the 4 pics 1 word game this is a game where you have to figure out what the word is I am sorry about the long review please forgive me
A11RME5705M4PX B007N5YIOO 5 1364083200 30 my 5 year old loves the angry bird games for his nabi tablet only wish there were more of the angry bird games that would work on the nabi tablet

A11RMQF7ZD8QHV B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392422400 26 This is so awesome. Although my highscore is one, i an Gonna get better at it! Really entertaining!!! :3 Its funny when it poops or falls!
A11RMQF7ZD8QHV B00DJYC55C 1 1381536000 124 I don't think this app is for kids because it is inappropriate and I deleted it when she asked for personal information. It even has a camera! SERIOUSLY!?!?!? Outfit 7 should know better than spying on people. I don't like this piece of junk. Hey, I know what I am doin y'all! I speak from personal experience. I'm about to go to middle school! All those 5 star review's are probably fake and if they aren't, CHANGE YOUR MIND!!!!! I am very angry. I will call the cops on u if u continue your inappropriate stuff! I AM NOT JOKING! I WILL TEL MY MOM ABOUT IT! this is THE most disgusting app in the app store. I am very disappointed. * tsk tsk*
A11RMQF7ZD8QHV B008V06NRU 5 1372204800 20 Pou is a GREAT game all my friends have this app &amp; they love it &amp; so do I! :D
A11ROS1K0IOSX4 B004Q87AA0 5 1346889600 38 I LOVE to read at night but the hubby likes to sleep. This app is my best of both worlds!I like the never turn off setting so I don't have to turn it back on every 10 minutes
A11ROS1K0IOSX4 B007PW1BZY 4 1344384000 24 Fun game. Easy to use. Wish I could customize player to be me and that it kept stats but love it still the same.
A11RRV8HHLE2CA B007TXUZ1U 1 1360972800 25 Soon boring all you do is tap on a food type and buy stuff you don't even want it sucks DO NOT BUY THIS APP!
A11RRV8HHLE2CA B008JGSM6G 5 1364169600 29 This game is really fun and addicting for all ages. But it can be frustrating so don't consider this for kids under 6 ish. Otherwise it is really fun
A11RRV8HHLE2CA B00884GR0W 2 1343606400 52 ok I haven't played this but I have played block story lite and it sounds like exactly the same thing. it automatically save on block story lite. or at least it does on mine. I would not spend my money on this when you can get the exact same thing for free.
A11RTH0NKH6L51 B00ANUMR1W 5 1358812800 23 I feel that this game is the bomb this game is like blood and glory I love fighting dragons good and clean graphics
A11RTH0NKH6L51 B0094J0J18 5 1355184000 24 To me this game Is raw it is a cool game... they should allow u to change character when u have defeated ur opponent
A11RTH0NKH6L51 B00D5YT6IA 5 1372291200 25 To me doing these words is good.... everyone should get this game really fun.. I enjoy this game especially if you are not doing anything
A11RU2YNML78P1 B004FRX0MY 1 1363737600 20 I have been waiting a month for amazon to troubleshoot why this APP won't function on my Samsung Galaxy S2.
A11RU2YNML78P1 B008655OVQ 2 1391731200 24 I didn't like this APP. It's not a real Drudge App it's a copy that doesn't provide the content you get from the original.
A11RU2YNML78P1 B00FAPF5U0 3 1391731200 21 I dont get why so many people are hooked on this. I didn't like it at all. Thanks but no thanks
A11RU2YNML78P1 B008KYOCA2 3 1391731200 20 I tried this but I really don't use organizers very much. I tend to just use my head instead. Thanks
A11RVOMWVA08PX B005CD2TQ8 5 1399334400 38 This game is from cool math games and is one of my favorites! I'm on level 7 and it's challenging but I won't quit. If you like fun, challenging, and addicting games, this is the game for you!
A11RVOMWVA08PX B00B2WWEFE 2 1395878400 28 So you get the first 6 levels and then, you have to get the deluxe version for 0.99 or 1.99. I can't remember. Hope this is helpful! :)
A11RVOMWVA08PX B00DJFIMW6 5 1394236800 23 If you like the minions from despicable me and you like temple run, you should get this app. It's really fun and addicting.
A11RWP436Q0V8J B007PT3QOQ 5 1333756800 25 The most fun I had with a Sim type game since I played Sims 3.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a good time passer!
A11RWP436Q0V8J B006ICEDIO 5 1336867200 36 Very fun and entertaining tome. Had hours of additive game play. Would recommend this game to anyone looking for hours of fun and entertainment.  Easy enough for kids but a nice challenge for any age group.
A11RWP436Q0V8J B007TBAQCK 4 1337040000 47 Started playing and lost track of time. Before you know it hours have passed. Who would think a game of chance involving no skillncould be son entertaining.  I just wish more slot machines would be unlocked sooner.  Takes too long to level up and unlock additional machines.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00CRFAAYC 4 1378512000 35 This game is good, and you get different tattoos and the opportunity to design your own. However, I don't think it would be worth the money to buy the free version just to color tattoos.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00CZDSK7K 5 1378512000 33 This game is a lot of fun to play. Sometimes you do run low on money, but even just buying the Sofa Change money can last you awhile, and is definitely worth it.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B008B84O6Y 1 1370390400 24 This game wouldn't even work for me. I uninstalled after a few tries, and was disappointed by the company, who has other good games.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00A7ICO7C 4 1383955200 37 This is great, just like the original Bakery Story with several special meals and items. I always have the same problem with these games. You can't get very far without purchasing something and it requires constant attention.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B008OOYALE 4 1370390400 40 The game is fun, however it takes forever to earn money, expand, grow food, hatch eggs. So the game is kind of slow to get anything, and you have to ask others for stuff to expand and visit their island.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B0064X7FVE 3 1370390400 20 The app works, but after awhile just constantly forced closed, causing me to end up having to uninstall the app.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B0088QGB7Y 4 1370390400 37 Fun game, cure idea. Only complaint is it is hard to get berries, and it takes long time to do certain things, and then you have to get them immediately (for growing foods), otherwise they go bad.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B006ZMEI3W 5 1370390400 20 Lots of fun to play, may be a bit expensive, but definitely worth the price. Tons of levels to play.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B006RM6JCI 4 1378512000 23 This is a fun game to play. Some of the levels are a little challenging, but not too challenging that you can't pass.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B0080SZ0V8 4 1378512000 55 This game is a lot of fun to play, and has fun puzzles that are not to challenging to complete. I don't feel that it is worth paying two dollars (I got it as the free app of the day), and I am currently stuck on a level and I have no way to pass.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00A3HQX2Y 4 1370390400 24 Pretty good game, just like the original except for a few special items for Thanksgiving. Clothes go off the racks fast, so plan ahead.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00DDZM0GQ 5 1378512000 40 This a very fun game to play. Similar to Tetris, it is very easy to play and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. With different settings to choose from, you can just relax and play or challenge yourself.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00A70ZHQ0 4 1383955200 33 Just like the original Restaurant Story except with a few special items and deals. Same problem I have with all games like this, you can't get far with out having to spend money.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00DEG4Z1W 2 1378512000 26 This game is okay. Not that fun to play, and to unlock any thing more than the basic characters and colors, you have to pay money.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B008Y0REKC 5 1370390400 31 I had some issues at first, but they have been fixed, so now the app works smoothly. Fun game to play, just wish that rare eggs didn't cost what they do.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00A3NQNUU 5 1370390400 24 Lots of fun, lots of dragons to get. Full of new things to do and purchase. Breeding and building take awhile, but that's all.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00AMR1HZ8 4 1378512000 24 Just like the game on the TV. Fun to play. However about half the time the app justs shuts down and I can't play.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B009ZHQLHA 1 1383955200 43 Every time I tried to open this game, it would take a long time and then eventually it would say that it was unable to load the game. I had WiFi if it needed it, and I tried several times to no avail.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00AA87JGU 4 1378512000 28 A good game to play. A little challenging here and there but not to bad. Sometimes I needed to use cheats, but I'm not that good at these.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00ALKKM98 5 1370390400 21 Great game to play, a lot like the original game. Lots of different levels to play, challenging sometimes but still fun.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B008IXP8IU 3 1370390400 31 Good idea, however some clues are very challenging and I can't figure them out. You also are only given a couple of packs to play, and you must buy the rest.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B0087EACJK 4 1370390400 48 This is a fun game to play. It can be a bit challenging at times, and beating the to e to get extra points is hard, but that doesn't matter, because thankfully you can go to the next level as long as you got through the previous level.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00BTYP6QE 4 1370390400 47 I loved the idea or this game, and it was fun to play. However, I disliked that you didn't have the option to skip a level, so if you couldn't pass one you were forced to use power ups, and they only give you 2 of those.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00CWY76CC 4 1378512000 22 A fun game, a little different from the other games like it. Definitely a good game to play in your free time.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B0060D80NU 4 1370390400 31 Fun idea, good to play, however, it takes awhile to earn money, so it's more of a game you play after an hour or so, to collect money and buy/upgrade/fix things.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B005HB4F08 3 1370390400 52 I downloaded this app because I thought it would be fun to see the results. It was interesting, but however just a trial and you had to buy the full version. I also thought that for some of the challenges, it was very hard to figure out what you had to do.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B007BH7T90 4 1378512000 37 Good game, but instructions aren't very clear, and people who haven't played before will have difficulty. If you know what you are doing, then this is a good app. Lots of different set ups for the board.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B007ZSADMK 3 1370390400 25 This game was okay. The beginning levels are pretty simple, but they get hard and there is no way to get any help or hints.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00AOX5Z4E 4 1378512000 41 This game is fun to play, however sometimes it is challenging to complete it and you have to constantly go back and forth between rooms.  The upside is there are clues in the game available if you can't figure it out.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00B29PJGS 3 1383955200 20 The game is okay, it is very slow which is why I gave it this rating. Definitely needs some work.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B00F2UZ2UQ 5 1383955200 63 This game is sooooo much fun to play. In the beginning, it might take a couple tries to get your community started (Hint: upgrade your farming first with tech points), but after that your village should have enough food to keep most of the population alive. You will have people die, so don't think that you are doing anything wrong if you do.
A11RYUB6ITAGVF B0092S4WLY 3 1378512000 27 This game is okay, and definitely a challenge to play. Not very easy at some points, and I needed to Google cheats to get pass most levels.
A11S3CAEF12TVI B006QC6YL0 5 1355875200 33 Decent quick-reference for a surprisingly large number of home remedies. Haven't had any issues with it in terms of crashing or invasive permissions thus far. Definitely worth the space on my Kindle Fire.
A11S3CAEF12TVI B004MC8CA2 4 1329350400 47 Does (almost) everything that I need for a Bible app to do and a great deal more than I expected. Nice interface, good usability, decent tool bag. Need a tool or two more to meet the needs of an in-depth studier/teacher, but still totally useful. Great app!
A11S3CAEF12TVI B004LOMB2Q 4 1327881600 48 Works great for me so far, but it constantly requests update downloads, and now I see that the terms &amp; conditions are quite invasive; they can use or sell your notes or uploaded info at their leisure to promote their app. Considering uninstalling this just for THAT reason.
A11S3E6J9GOI3Z B0064X7FVE 5 1375920000 27 I'm not an outdoors person, but I like to know when bad weather is coming - and it prepares me what to wear for the work day!
A11S3E6J9GOI3Z B00658U5HE 5 1375920000 24 I really appreciate knowing how full/low the battery is. When there's a storm coming, I charge my kindle totally full! I am prepared :)
A11S3E6J9GOI3Z B00975HIYU 5 1371859200 25 I play this all the time on facebook. Now, I can take it with me! I hope facebook will soon allow us more free games.

A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B007VUCAVO 4 1349222400 21 this is a great app. I like the way it let's me check on the way my kindle uses the power
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B0093QQAEM 5 1367539200 38 This is by far the best app of it&quot;s kind that I&quot;'ve seen. More bang for your buck and really easy to get the show you want to watch!!! Buy this app, you will not regret it. :-)
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B00DJFIMW6 5 1373760000 38 Medium hard with funny characters that look just like on the movie. I will be playing this game.and having fun with it for some time to come. My daughter also loves it that's how I found it...good luck!!!!
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B00BMR5HOO 5 1380326400 25 This is a great app that allows you to set up multiple alarms, check the weather for the hour, day,or week all in the same
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B005YIPHL0 5 1332806400 23 good app I read.the daily as part of.my prayers. dload this you will ne happy with it. nice way to start your day.
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B00IZMQ8G0 4 1396310400 32 This seems like a good game, answers are of medium difficulty and  interesting to boot. I really liked the first round and look forward to figuring out the rest of the game!
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B009SDHIPK 5 1379808000 24 For free.it's  one of the best games I play. Fun game with good graphics, easy to learn and fun to play, for free it's
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B0063M22QO 4 1368144000 30 Good game with lots of options and many tile placement boards. I'm kinda new to Maj jong but this seems to be one that will be fun to quite awhile.
A11S5PFA0HGLI1 B0054JZC6E 5 1339459200 29 great games from easy to fairly hard. my 4 year old loves it asnmuch as I do! give it a try you will be pleasently surprised as I was
A11S5TYRNBA64A B006OC2ANS 4 1330387200 22 Fun game, great graphics, good point, time consuming, stuff to work for, challenging, never-ending, fast, motivating! Recommend to anyone that likes fighting.
A11S5TYRNBA64A B0054JZC6E 1 1325980800 23 Too many ads. Whatever you do, do not update. The system is jank. It's alright, but now I'm just trying to fill space.
A11S5TYRNBA64A B007MFDUP8 3 1335484800 35 This game was updated a few weeks ago and has since become more appealing. Now that Draw Something has finally come out, I wouldn't waste your time on a copycat game such as this one.
A11S5TYRNBA64A B007KPOZK4 5 1334534400 61 This game is AWESOME! I downloaded it last night, and I haven't stopped playing it since! I love all the missions you get, while trying to get to number one on the A-List. I would download this vame if you want to have fun for hours and hours. Try it and if you don't like it, you can always uninstall it!
A11S5UDE14JMHW B007SYWFRM 1 1348099200 38 I originally got sucked into this game, then an update came along and would no longer allow it to open.  Forced to reinstall losing all previous save data. App steals money and forces you to start all over.
A11S5UDE14JMHW B00808GTI6 1 1352592000 57 Made several attempts to use the story sync feature for the walking dead show, on kindle fire hd, but timer to next question keeps freezing and is slow, pretty much useless feature.  Takes so much time to refresh and reload constantly, takes away rather than adds to the experience.  Maybe the app actually works on other devices.
A11S5UDE14JMHW B00A4034W2 5 1354492800 21 This is a very fun defense game, great sound, graphics, and gameplay,amazing game for free.  We need more games like this.
A11S9E2AUDE8Z7 B00DRPVE3M 5 1393113600 40 I've always been a huge fan of uno and this game is very similar to the actual card game. You must earn coins in order to play which is a bit of a hassle but the game is fun overall!
A11S9E2AUDE8Z7 B009HKL4B8 5 1389484800 35 I've been playing this game for about a month now and I am still very much addicted to it. You must have patience in order to enjoy this game but over all I love it.
A11S9E2AUDE8Z7 B00AHNC0SK 3 1387756800 61 This game was really fun at first but, it quickly got rather boring. It takes a long time to level up and unlock new rides or shops so you find yourself with nothing to do in between. The shops and rides needs to be cheaper and it shouldn't be that complicated to level up. This game could be so much better.
A11S9Y2YWGV4E6 B00CTQ6SIG 4 1398556800 32 Awesome game but the only bad thing is we never get donuts yea you have to buy them but I'm a kid so please give more donuts I need that lemon tree
A11S9Y2YWGV4E6 B00JQNG6FA 5 1403568000 56 Awesome game the reason why telltale hasn't released ep3 yet is because they need to remake the episode for kindle.due to kindle not having a more detailed graphics so they have to remake it 2. They also have the wolf among us so they do The walking dead this month and wolf among us the next
A11S9Y2YWGV4E6 B00HF19RVK 5 1403568000 33 Ok yes the title is very misleading but on consoles/pc it costs more p.s. for moms out there saying it's bad READ THE TITLE AND PICTURES AND THIS IS A VERY POPULAR GAME
A11S9Y2YWGV4E6 B008M2WGRI 4 1404604800 20 This game is good but when you move it just cuts off so I have to give it a 4
A11S9Y2YWGV4E6 B00FZHIQK4 4 1402444800 61 I fine this game really cool and interesting however the problems is 1. The graphics is not better then pc it's 2d so yeah 2. You can't choose your crime I mean some of them is not appropriate for kids but I'm 11. Although the game is amazing but mat please make a new one for kindle that's exactly pc edition
A11S9Y2YWGV4E6 B00C5A5B02 3 1398470400 20 Honestly it's pretty good but the fact we have to buy in order to play so this game isn't great
A11SASQEC9O530 B00846I1Y4 5 1352073600 33 My son enjoys playing with this app. It has bright colors, a wide variety of sounds available and some preloaded songs that the app will play itself. It is a nice little app.
A11SASQEC9O530 B006ZE9Q5A 5 1337040000 22 This is a truly wonderful mix of object finding and some light puzzle solving. It is a fantastic game to be sure.
A11SASQEC9O530 B007VCVCAM 5 1335225600 20 This game is very fun, especially if you love Garfield like I do. It is very simple, but still fun.
A11SC2EXIHV6RJ B0087FDS22 5 1353024000 20 This game is so CUTE, you definitely need to get it.It 's probably the best free game in the appstore.

A11SCUTC12P83N B00E83G68K 5 1385596800 21 I usally dont like this kind of games but this game is fantastic it is a must buy for all ages
A11SEYU6LSW8BZ B00G5LQ5MU 5 1391817600 46 I haven't played Escape From The Titanic long but from what I can tell so far it's a very fun, interesting &amp; addictive game. It's a great way to pass the time &amp; it really makes you use your brain trying to figure out the puzzles!
A11SEYU6LSW8BZ B00AREIAI8 5 1393200000 41 So far this game has been very fun &amp; a great way to pass the time!!! I actually feel connected with my horse because the graphics are so realistic!!! Great game so far I'm definitely going to keep playing those one!!!
A11SJAH021T0EF B00A3NQNUU 5 1377302400 24 This is an awesome game! Great graphics, and easy to use. DOWNLOAD IT! It's free, what do you got to lose? ^&pound;^ &lt;~~~ {owl}
A11SJAH021T0EF B00A8ECU24 5 1372118400 21 Constantly playing this app!!! So fun. Only bad part is you have to be connected to internet. And remember, BACON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)))))
A11SJAH021T0EF B0067VKQLE 5 1376524800 22 I love love love love love this game! Great graphics, easy to use, fun  for all ages! But remember, it's addicting! :3
A11SJAH021T0EF B008Y2FRFO 5 1377302400 31 I play this ALL THE TIME. It's a really fun, relaxing game. The only downside is the minimal pop ups. Also, you cannot change the background. Otherwise, this game is epic!!!!
A11SJLFAU8Z5TP B006VXRNYG 5 1360972800 35 My boys who are 4 and 7 both love this app. it is colorful and interesting. You can't draw in color on black paper in real life, but it works well on my Kindle Fire.
A11SJLFAU8Z5TP B00885RFRK 5 1360972800 58 My son is only 7 but loves this game, he would play it for hours if we let him. I just wish there were several different settings, like one for African game (zebra, impalas, elephants, and lion hazards), American game (deer, elk, etc, with wolf and lion mountain hazards), and maybe Asian game (with python and cobra hazards).
A11SJLFAU8Z5TP B007SYWFRM 5 1360972800 65 I was surprised to see that my 4 year old loves watching my 7 year old boy play this game. since there is so much going on on the screen the 4 year old can even help by doing some things also on the screen. I wish there were more games that allowed two kids to play at the same time on the same surface.
A11SJLFAU8Z5TP B005LIYX5Y 4 1361145600 33 my boys both enjoy this app. My 4 year old sits there for an hour just changing the paint color and rims, while my 7 year old just loves racing and adding upgrades.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B004GVYXTS 5 1358899200 27 This game is a fun way to learn.  It can be hard, but it is very addicting.  I recommend this game for anyone who likes word games.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00E8KLWB4 5 1402185600 48 Finally, a great hidden object game on kindle fire!  I love this game.  It has a good plot and the maps are fun.  The game is challenging, but not too impossible to do.  I definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes hidden object games!!!! An absolute must!!!!!
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00HDRTGDK 4 1389571200 35 This game is fun.  There are things that I didn't remember until now!  Fantastic game!!!!  Some of the stuff I can't remember how to spell.  But good game to remind you of the good times.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B0055DL1G4 5 1354233600 23 This app is really good and useful.  i read the updates quite often.  i also like the different categories you can go through.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00AVGGYNA 4 1399334400 37 This app is fun and basic for bingo players.  If that's what you want, no frills, just the game, this game is for you.  I also like the fact that every four hours, you get more coins!!!!
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00D948SS0 4 1387670400 43 I love this word find, but you have to have tokens to play.  You have to pay to get them if you want to play more than one game every 1/2 hour.  However, you sometimes get a few tokens in a treasure chest.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00FAPF5U0 5 1384992000 31 I love this game!!!!  I am addicted to playing it.  The bad things are that you only get 5 lives at a time, and you have to pay for different quests.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00A4KVFLY 4 1372377600 38 This game is fun and it makes you think quickly.  The only thing I don't like is that you have to pay to get more coins if you need them.  You only get to spin once a day.
A11SL4OW14ABRU B0064X7FVE 5 1373673600 38 This app is wonderful.  You can put in any location and it will tell you what the weather will be.  It lets you look at an interactive map also.  Great map for when you are on the go!!!
A11SL4OW14ABRU B00A9VD67E 4 1369440000 36 These games are fun, but are more challenging than the previous edition.  The games will keep you busy.  If you come back to the games everyday, you get points to buy another game in the app.
A11SM4G60ZFZH7 B009GFCVNO 5 1383264000 87 If your a big fan of baseball, you'll like this game.  It's fairly realistic but easy to play.  I like that it's an offline game and it uses the real pro players.  Only downside it does get jerky from time to time and has completely froze my kindle fire a couple times but I hard restart the kindle and it continues the game right where I left off.  I'll remove some apps from my kindle and maybe it will run better, we'll see.  Overall a great game.
A11SM4G60ZFZH7 B006CZ4238 5 1352073600 59 This game is great fun, especially when I only paid. $0.99 for it.  If your expecting Xbox quality then your going to be dissappointed.  If you have realistic expectations, then your really going to like this game.  To me it looks and plays similar to Madden 07 on Xbox but with some different features.  It's well worth the $0.99!
A11SM4G60ZFZH7 B008DYK0I2 5 1363737600 20 Got for my kindle fire.  Works well, would recommend this app to anyone who likes to watch ESPN. Thank you.
A11SM4G60ZFZH7 B009WYCDZU 5 1357257600 114 If you have realistic expectations for a mobile game, then you'll love this game.  Well worth the $.99 I paid for it.  Excellent graphics, controls are straight forward, sound is great.  It does take a lot of memory to run smooth, I had to remove a bunch of apps so it would run smooth.  But I didn't use those apps much anyway, plus if you have a kindle fire like me, they're stored on the cloud so I can re-install them at anytime.I do have some minor complaints about the game itself.  Don't like the fact your upgrades only last one race and no open world driving.  Still the game is lots of fun.
A11SW6BMNVW7XN B004QQ7KV6 5 1329955200 25 Love this for the pictures and celebrity gossip! Nice quality of pics and stories. Love the idea of a one click nonlinear magazine! Its great!
A11SW6BMNVW7XN B006VW94HQ 5 1329955200 20 just purchased this,  and cannot stop playing! Great game! Highly reccomend it to any word game lover. Keeps yah thinking.
A11SXWJ5NHPDT8 B006GWE5PM 3 1328400000 76 After playing this game for several minutes, I have come to the conclusion I'm glad this was a free app.It does have good graphics. In fact, that's the best part of the game. Otherwise, it's something that should be designated strickly for adolescents. They would probably enjoy it.If you're an adult though, I would highly recommend searching for something more challenging. This is way too simplistic - there's not much of a challenge in playing it.
A11SXWJ5NHPDT8 B009HUBJPO 2 1378512000 149 The only thing accurate about this app is, it will let you make phone calls. HOWEVER, for an unknown reason when using it, while the person you call can hear you loud and clear - the volume of the person talking (at least on my tablets (an Acer A200 and Pandigital Supernova) was so low you had to strain to hear what was being said -- even with my tablet's volume control maxed out.Contacting MagicJack support at least for me was a total waste of time. They tried to blame the problem first on other apps, then on my Wifi router - even though the problem occurs on multiple tablets and even if I am not home.The magicjack Talk Free app apparently does not have a volume control a user can adjust.My recommendation would be to pass up on this one until such time they get it working correctly.
A11SXWJ5NHPDT8 B005MKRVLE 1 1340150400 33 No matter what I tried, I never could get this app to run.  I get a Forceclose error when I try to run it. It's apparently not compatible with a Pandigital SuperNova tablet.
A11SXWJ5NHPDT8 B006AZZPCM 5 1377734400 26 What can you say? It works. My primary purpose in getting this app was so I could watch Youtube  videos/movies and it does a great job.
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B00CUWWLWG 5 1372550400 64 I just downloaded this game the other day. I like games that you have to build up your town and defended. this is exactly what the game is. works great on my fire. I'm an adult and really like the game. oh, its pretty easy to level up as well. I also have not been tempted to spend my own money in the game.
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B0051HL5Q0 4 1329523200 33 I love this game. only complaint is there are not enough levels. beat game in one sitting. I hope with each update that the dev will add more levels :) awesome game though.
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B004MC8CA2 5 1325635200 38 I was looking for a Bible on here so maybe I'd keep up with my reading! well this app is awesome. 100's of plans to choose from. Several different versions of the Bible. Its amazing!!!! I love it!!!!!
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B004N8KDNY 1 1329523200 29 stupidest game ive ever played. no instructions on how to play. from what I did figure out u placed ur stuff and watched. borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring. am removing from my fire!
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B00A3E2BVE 5 1356825600 96 I avoided this game for a long time. played on fb and instantly became addicted. I put it on my phone right away. I was surprised there was not an app for my kindle. its about time. I definitely prefer on my kindle to other places. And btw you earn coins to unlock more lists and you unlock more songs by getting at least 3right in a row. it makes you want to continue playing because it gives you something to earn towards. they add new lists almost weekly.  amazing game. Best FACEBOOK game ever made!!!!!!!
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B006VXRNYG 5 1327622400 47 I love to Doodle. I love this app!!! My three kids love it too. One of which is a 13 yr old boy. The randomness is what makes it so fun!!!! The movie part is awesome. My kids made movie after movie!!!! I highly recommend this app!!!!!!!!!
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B006RC0ZP0 4 1327104000 21 good time waster. works great on my kindle fire. my kids would love it. cute graphics. love the colorful &quot;blood &quot;
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B0080IOHLW 3 1339977600 35 love it. lost 2 stars because it twice reset itself after I had 17 floors. very very uncool. I am not happy. ill try again later. hopefully they will fix this issue. its not right!!!!!
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B006QZM73Q 4 1326758400 27 this is cute for kiddos and kinda entertaining for a minute for adults. would never pay for it tho. I think my daughters will love this :)
A11SZB6G4SZZ1A B007NACZPI 3 1332547200 23 not a horrible game. however, I don't like to pass a quest we have to spend real money. that should ALWAYS be optional!!!!
A11T23TW15FOCQ B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384560000 23 This game is so much fun very addictive hard to put down i would recommend this game  to people who like puzzles :)
A11T23TW15FOCQ B00BG3ID0Y 5 1370044800 22 this game is very addictive! very fun keeps you thinking this is such a great app download it and see for yourself.
A11T23TW15FOCQ B00I8Q77Y0 5 1405209600 25 I love this game extremely hard to put down and very addictive! It's not an exact replica of floppy bird, and the graphics are amazing.
A11T23TW15FOCQ B00FX6ZBXC 5 1388880000 21 This game is very addictive and entertaining. Very hard to put down and the little characters are also really cute !
A11T7E8JSP7KM B004HXHVZ8 4 1368403200 20 We use this a lot to check out potential movies for family fun nights and date nights. Easy to use.
A11T7E8JSP7KM B004SBS8LA 5 1368403200 29 The kids love Angry Birds and it is great because they arent always hitting an add trying to play and potentially buying things. Good entertainment for long car rides.
A11T87761UPO9W B00GTXFOIA 5 1390435200 21 I love the graphics very much.  You get some really great pay outs so that you can keep playing the game.
A11T87761UPO9W B00HKF00UI 5 1396137600 24 Great payouts.  Great graphics.  The bonuses are awesome too.  What more could you want in a slot machine?  Just like the real thing too.
A11T87761UPO9W B008NCUFYS 5 1357516800 25 A great way to spend some time.  The only thing I don't like is the green slime. It shouldn't take so much of your score.
A11T87761UPO9W B00EBE8MUG 4 1380758400 24 A great way to kill time...it's super fun. And it's super easy to play.  If you like tv then you will love this game.
A11T87761UPO9W B00CRLSN4U 5 1381968000 23 I absolutely love this game.  I haven't put it down since I bought it.  It's got awesome graphics and it is super fun.
A11T87761UPO9W B00HAS1AKY 4 1401148800 23 So far, I like the game.  I've gotten past the easy ones and now comes the hard ones which really make you think.
A11T87761UPO9W B00KQHVWWC 5 1404259200 23 I absolutely love this slots game.  It's got cool graphics and you get lots of bonus coins.  Great way to spend some time.
A11T87761UPO9W B00JF8Z1NO 4 1401235200 24 So far, I see nothing but great payouts and great graphics.  Bonus game could pay out better which is the only flaw I see.
A11T87761UPO9W B00ESCOI7C 5 1381190400 21 A great time waster.  Very easy to play with great graphics.  Great fun for kids or adults.  Definitely get this game.
A11T92D2E1AQM5 B00B7AIZOA 5 1363651200 43 Just started using the app but can tell already  that it will be very handy when inspiration strikes, and I am out and about with the Kindle :) Very painterly and can achieve some nice effects with it. Thumbs up for this one!
A11T92D2E1AQM5 B00846GKTW 5 1368230400 29 can dress up and change ur look takes a while to earn coins and its laggy but could be really fun once you can get more clothes and stuff
A11T92D2E1AQM5 B00AHNC0SK 5 1390003200 29 Theme park is lots of fun a good challenge but easy enough to progress to the next levels. Earn and don't need to spend at all get it !
A11T92D2E1AQM5 B00FAPF5U0 4 1383436800 41 ill give it 4 stars -- its fun,  challenging,  but maddening when it forces you to wait long periods of time to try again for the next level! will keep playing tho its got me hooked! great graphics colors and animation
A11T92D2E1AQM5 B00A9NXGAO 5 1363651200 33 It's fun and addictive! Should be a bit easier to earn $$ to spend but I still  give  it high marks for mindless entertainment value! :)  Add me as a bud -- Y5MJ7
A11T9IINVLY5PC B009HKL4B8 5 1383436800 26 This Game is awesome! But I wish it was easier to gain life style points it's so hard I don't know who to earn them :/
A11T9IINVLY5PC B00AHNC0SK 5 1389052800 29 It sounds fun I can't wait to play it :) friend has it I love this game but I didn't get to play it she did I watched haha
A11T9IINVLY5PC B008PB2ZVI 1 1385942400 21 This doesn't help at all its a waste of space don't get this or the game wastes up space ,so disappointed
A11T9IINVLY5PC B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392076800 20 It's just like flappy birds  but better  good this is no complaints about it I LOVE THIS GAME  SO MUCH
A11T9IINVLY5PC B00GNIJAEA 5 1392076800 27 Been waiting for every for it to update the app taking too long  to update they need too hurry up but other wise it's a great app
A11TF6J0JHZ7YY B00CT9ZVGI 5 1387324800 80 at 53 I came rather late to the world of tablets and video games. I have only been at this a little over 2 years but in all that time (I like to do things in a big way!) I have played hundreds of games &amp; this is far and away my favorite! its got everything you are looking for....hidden objects &amp; mystery &amp; a great story. and the ending is not to be missed! thanks again big fish games.
A11TF6J0JHZ7YY B008FF8PT0 5 1367712000 26 worth every penny!lots of h.o. with just enough Back story to keep your interest. played 2nd game first and loved that too. try it....you'll like it!
A11TF6J0JHZ7YY B0097EWK3A 5 1388275200 33 this game has a plethora of h.o. which I love! the story was intriguing &amp; kept my interest throughout. if u like mysteries &amp; hidden objects &amp; fun.....you will love this game too!
A11TF6J0JHZ7YY B00B4VI8MQ 5 1367107200 24 love this game. lots of h.o. and puzzles. playing it for the second time now and still having fun. definitely got my moneys worth
A11TF9114FSRC9 B00IKZX1ZI 1 1395878400 24 I deleted it immediately.  It was too confusing and difficult for a 4 year old or her grandmother. We went on to Dr,. Panda.
A11TF9114FSRC9 B0079Q963K 4 1347840000 148 The Kindle Fire connects easily to the web, downloads fast, the picture is clear and bright, the colors are clear and the sound is audible in a fairly quiet room.  It is everything they say it is.  I was playing a word game, Every Word, on my sister's Kindle Touch.  Even in the bright light of the beach I could see it clearly.  I was very disappointed when that app, Every Word, was not available on the Kindle Fire.  I really thought that if you could get it on the cheaper Kindle, it would be available on the Fire.  In addition, I cannot see the Fire in a bright light.  It is really not good for outdoor viewing.  Since I love to be outside, this was also a disappointment.  I understand they will be coming out with a new Fire and I hope it can be seen outside.
A11TF9114FSRC9 B006VXRNYG 5 1347840000 142 My granddaughter (age 2) has this program on her Kindle Fire.  I bought a Fire just to keep up with her.  She loves to draw and then erase on this program.  When I was playing with her, she would ask me to draw a flower or a horse and then we would add to it and I found that I loved doing it all by myself.  As a Board of Elections worker, I brought the Kindle to a meeting.  One of my fellow workers was so fascinated by it.  She likes to doodle while on the telephone.  The colors are so bright and you can change backgrounds and the way the colors come up on the screen.  It is lots of mindless fun.  I am sure a really talented person can draw fabulous things on it.  I stick to flowers and horses.
A11TGPKLRIKSHO B00ABGEFWC 4 1356739200 21 My 3 year old loves this game. Very colorful and playful so it keeps her interested. I'm glad I found it!
A11TIXC8TRP05L B00G5LQ5MU 4 1384819200 23 it is a fun and challenging game and I really enjoyed working my way through all of the levels and getting everything done
A11TIXC8TRP05L B0067Q42BY 4 1330473600 22 this game is a lot of fun, some tiles look a lot alike but it makes the game more of a chalange.
A11TIXC8TRP05L B00785P2QC 4 1352419200 20 this game is great one of the best I have ever played I love having a game to build in
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B0066T8OH0 5 1377388800 29 Very much like the original computer tetris I used to play. I enjoy the extra features that can help when you get into a jam and close to losing.
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B0066T8SDU 4 1354752000 75 I love the actual game play.  The teacher feature is fantastic, and skills are steadily improving, though I often feel dumb for missing high point plays.  Unfortunately the app is pretty glitchy for me.  Often it can't connect to the server to update a current game and it frequently kicks me out of the app entirely.  Sadly, it doesn't has total cross platform play, so my family who play through the computer can't connect up.
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B0087TQYUG 4 1354752000 59 This is a fun word game.  Basically it's Boggle but with fun additions to the gameplay, like freezing the count down clock, or getting some help finding words.  Beware, if you get addicted and are playing a lot of games you may run out of tokens and be prompted/tempted to buy more instead of waiting for them to replenish.
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B006P57MUK 4 1369440000 28 This app makes redbox even more convenient.  It allows you to check and see what location has what movies and even reserve them.  Has not glitched so far.
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B005AKD836 4 1354752000 62 I already had a Goodreads account so this is a nice on the go feature, especially if I am in a bookstore and want to pull up my Wishlist or add a title to remember.  If you like adding updates this works nicely as well, but I find that for anything more involved, like reviewing, I still like the computer interface better.
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B009WO7NQO 5 1354752000 57 I never really saw the appeal of Angry birds, until now.  This is perfect for the Star Wars nerd, how can anyone resist Obi Wan birds that can use the force, Han Solo blaster birds?  Even better, Darth Vader laughs mockingly if you fail a level.  Each section just keeps getting better and better.  Worth every penny.
A11TJDOKEL4R49 B007P8BMTS 3 1354752000 102 Finding and playing episodes is a breeze and it even includes previews, but the play has some glitches.  I have watched several different episodes and at some point during each one, it has skipped ahead.  I have to drag the cursor back and watch the commercial again so that I could get back to where I was.  I am used to having to watch a commercial when playing episodes online, but this was a little excessive.  There are four and five in each break and it' the same three commercials, which gets mind numbingly old.  The picture quality has been pretty solid.
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00F7YHDWC 5 1382918400 39 The reason why I love this app is because it is so fun but it is pretty wrong yet very funny to watch the consenqunces when your person dies. BTW when you get enough points watch the music video.
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00820STKI 5 1373241600 33 On the Fourth of July me and my family couldn't see the fireworks from our house so I downloaded this app and everyone loved it very much so you should get this app!
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B008393Q2O 5 1365552000 27 it is easy to use and I can put all my notes in here and I can keep track with everything so I would get this app
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393977600 38 apperently flappy is not an app anymore so this is basicly the same thing but just a different name if I deleted flappy bird off of my phone I would be upset but thank God for flappy wings
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00FXKHEK6 5 1383782400 28 this game is soooo fun.ky favorite cartoon is. mickey mousebicoj I mean nobody can top mickey mouse.when you play this game you are going to love it.trust me
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00EQ2GBFG 4 1378425600 34 this game is pretty cool. Its like you are preparing to become a doctor.  And the thing is babies are the most fragile pationts so now you know how to take care of them
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B0069G5Z9K 5 1346371200 22 it is dealt assome and fun. one time I was borerd and idoownloaded this app and this game is a life saver
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B0058VW36U 5 1344816000 20 I love it so much and I think that the little monster is so adorible and it keeps me busy
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00AK2RHR2 5 1378425600 29 I love this game ever since I was little.  This game is easy but there will be a few challenges , but you will get the hang of it.
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B00ANH526W 5 1366502400 22 you should get it because its like you are realty at collage so I would get this app if I were you
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B0062BYUJ8 5 1378598400 33 I am in love with this app.  I have trouble sleeping so I have to turn of the TV at like 12:00 pm. It isn't fun so you should get this app! :)
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B008V06NRU 5 1364688000 31 well 1 day my friend showed me Lou and I just had to have this app so I downloaded pou and it turned out to be a big responsability but fun
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B009PSV1HE 5 1383868800 36 this game is a great yet challenging game to play.whenever you play and it takes a while but you want to finish your shift just look at the door and see if the sign says closed
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B008MEM24S 5 1344816000 20 i love this game so much beacause it is so intresting and it has so many surprises it is fun
A11TKDG5RO57U8 B008PTVDU4 1 1345248000 25 this game used to be fun but it is just so boring hats it so much and when I tried to download it it froze
A11TKNUT86SRK B00AMR1HZ8 5 1366761600 44 Well now, who doesn't love WHEEL of FORTUNE? It's just the greatest game. It is just like on T V. I feel like I am right there with the players. So much actin for a action junkie like myself. Worth the money I paid.
A11TKNUT86SRK B00BGAZYLI 1 1366761600 56 It is simply boring. I cannot don't a purpose for the game. There's no action in this Game. Games seems to easy.It gives no feelings of elation when you guess the word. I played one time and it seems to go on and on and comes to no end. What's the purpose of playing this game.
A11TKNUT86SRK B0066T0BTO 5 1366761600 38 Action. I just love action. Keeps your brains alert and working.I am playing for the highest scores trying to top the highestscoring players. I want to be the best and highest scoring player that ever played the game.
A11TKNUT86SRK B009WJNXAE 5 1370649600 29 Just Love Bingo. The fact that I can play it on my Kindle makes me very happy. I usually play this one in bed when I can't sleep.It's exciting.
A11TM9XIDZPZM1 B004XNGKBS 3 1317081600 55 This app allows one to scribble notes with the touch of a fingertip. Neat idea in theory, but just not practical. I have excellent, small, feminine handwriting, and even with my fine dexterity, I am barely able to &quot;write&quot; legibly with this app.And? It's a LOT faster to just use Swype =(3 stars for creativity.
A11TM9XIDZPZM1 B005D9MUWY 2 1311292800 85 This keyboard replacement is marginally better than the stock keyboard. It's predictive text feature is somewhat useful -- particularly if you use similar phrases frequently in texts and social networking -- but fairly gimmicky.The real problem, though, is in just how much of a resource hog this app is. Running on my Droid-X1 with just one language installed, it eats 33 megs of memory and noticeably slowly and stutters my device.I'm sticking with FlexT9, which has similar features but uses just 6 megs of RAM.
A11TM9XIDZPZM1 B0099S2HAK 1 1363478400 79 I have a not-rooted Droid Bionic. Game throws the &quot;Marmalade blah blah failed to compile blah blah cannot link&quot; error upon launching. The game's UI then loads, but all text is missing (button labels and so on).Unable to play. =( =(ATTN DEVELOPER: please include a list of compatible devices so folks don't waste their time. Furthermore, please consider investigating the Bionic and Droid 3 (another reviewer) errors and correct them; no reason these phones shouldn't work w your product.
A11TM9XIDZPZM1 B008GTV9DO 4 1341792000 426 Downloaded the installer and the 78 megs of resource data over wifi thru my home internet onto my 7-month-old KFire, no problem. Took 60-90 seconds. Don't really understand why so many other reviewers were perturbed about the resource download; many MANY mobile games require downloading additional data, and several have resource files weighing in in the HUNDREDS of megs. My KFire is well-loved and heavily used, but I had plenty of room for this; the game's additional data sits on the sdcard (for us Fire people, that's the 8 gigs [5.36 gigs after formatting] of storage space), rather than chewing up the much more limited app space.That bears repeating: THE ADDITIONAL 78 MEGABYTE DOWNLOAD INSTALLS TO THE 8 GIGABYTE SDCARD OR "INTERNAL STORAGE" OF THE KINDLE FIRE!Just breathe, y'all.  78 megs isn't all that big in the grand scheme of things. :)That said, I do think the resource files are a bit large for this type of game. The 78 megs is all the music and sound effects, plus the language translation files for Brazilian Portuguese, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Japanese,  and Korean. While it's thoughtful of Gameloft to support so many of the world's popular languages, the translation support should have been handled on a modular, as-needed basis. Also, the music, voice-overs, and sound effects are a bit tiresome and not necessary for game play. Changing the way either or both of these sets of resource files are deployed would drastically slash the size of that additional download.Game plays fairly well and mostly smoothly (see next). Colors are bright. Animations are fine, not too terribly overdone. Card images are easily read on a 7" screen; they're probably large and clear enough for many folks to play on a phone. Sounds are a bit annoying and repetitive, but can be toggled on/off in the game options.This game has two pretty irritating behaviors, however. First, you can't exit out in the middle of a tournament and pick it back up later; you'll lose progress if you try. Second, selecting cards from your hand is a bit... twitchy and kludgy; I often picked the wrong card to play, or the double-tap wouldn't register, or (especially with a large number of cards in hand) the fanning thru would alternately stick or fly straight thru the entire fan.Game appears to be supported by the typical little banner adverts. You can earn ad-free time by trying other Gameloft titles, though. That was a nice touch.In all, a fun and decently produced version of Uno which is FREE. Gotta love free.
A11TM9XIDZPZM1 B0050D6PH4 3 1306281600 49 cute take on the &quot;pop whatever&quot; type games. bonus rounds are a nice touch &amp; keep it from getting too monotonous. drains battery very quickly -- surprisingly quickly, in fact. when trying to post high scores, it's not accepting anything I type; no high scores for me =(out-of-box droidx
A11TMZXPAI4G6O B0080IOHLW 3 1348444800 39 its fun, but pretty slowi f you're  not playing  with real money to get things  done.  Pretty  decent rate of in game help (money, speeding up) .  Good cause it won't take all your attention away from real life.
A11TP37XE4UHAQ B007PTJOV0 5 1396310400 58 this app is like supper Mario bros but better this on is not like leps  world 2 its a little harder Cu's the things u use to move lep are too close together but other than that its great and with number 2the things you use to move lep are not TO far apart but eased to move

A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B007R41E8O 5 1362614400 28 Another great game from Alawar.  Worth every penny, all 99 of them!  This is a typical HO adventure game.  Engaging storyline, challenging enough to be fun not frustrating.
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B008BM3TKM 4 1362182400 45 The story is interesting, graphics are nice and the audio is great.  Some of the cut scenes are annoying but they can be skipped.  No hints for hidden objects so you need to be good!  All in all, an enjoyable game & worth the price.
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B007MTQ8C6 4 1355529600 72 Nice clean solitaire game. Loads quickly, decent graphics, doesn't bog down my device. Good for filling waiting time or whenever you don't want to get too involved in something. My only beef is that I've been playing Spider on Pogo for so long I don't know how to win without the extra column and free spots!  I have a few of this company's titles and they are all solid apps, good value.
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B004SJIEXY 5 1354233600 55 I've had this game on my phone for a year now.  Amazingly I still find it the most entertaining Android game I've owned.  I buy them, play a couple of times, get bored, delete them.  This one is a keeper.  Perfect for waiting around in Dr.'s offices or airports or wherever you need some diversion.
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B00A77II0U 5 1358640000 62 Another great game from Alawar.  I'm playing on a Samsung Galaxy Note and it works great.  The scenes are drawn so well that even middle-aged eyes can see all the detail.  Storyline is interesting and the &quot;mood&quot; is appropriately spooky.  I'm getting faster at choosing games for this phone.... I just search on &quot;Alawar&quot; and pick one, no losers yet. Fun stuff.
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B0073LWEXK 2 1377648000 111 This game brought back less-than-fond memories of the old original text based adventure games.  Yes, the graphics are nice but it has the little descriptors like &quot;the water is muddy&quot; written across the top of the screen.  I kept waiting for it to say &quot;you are in a room with two exits, to your left and ahead.  You are attacked by three ogres. What do you want to do? &quot;I just couldn't shake the impression of old and dated.  New games have a much snazzier interface.  I'm afraid I didn't get very far in this game before abandoning it.  If I'm ever broke and in need of entertainment I'll try again.
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B0085CEBGY 5 1356220800 26 All the games I've purchased from Alawar have been great.  Beautiful graphics,&nbsp;engaging game play, interesting story, and a reasonable price. What else could I ask for?
A11TU3QQZUL3M9 B0097EWK3A 5 1368230400 31 Great combination of puzzles, HO, and adventuring.  The story is interesting, and there are a few unique features like the &quot;evidence wall&quot; that make the game fun.  Beautiful artwork. Very enjoyable!
A11TV6M8HF3YY3 B0095MVOMC 5 1377820800 23 makes you really look close to the details of a photo. Lots of fun, recommend this game to everyone that looks for details
A11TV6M8HF3YY3 B004FRX0MY 5 1377820800 21 I can listen to everything on the Amazon Cloud. Nice to stream over my Galaxy S3 no matter where I am.
A11TV6M8HF3YY3 B00BZ17Q8M 5 1377820800 20 Just like Vegas without the travel. I would recommend this game to any one that like going to the casino
A11TWPMDQUO6V2 B008D2QRAO 4 1340841600 20 wow great game good game to play to kill time I really like itthey need some free games like this
A11TWPMDQUO6V2 B009KS4XRO 3 1368489600 24 Really good game when it does not freeze.  Wish there were more credits and less time get them like every few minutes or so.
A11TWPMDQUO6V2 B008N8IV2U 3 1346284800 37 completed the game it is not what it is said to be it only has 90 floors.  now where are the rest of my floors.  I will change my rating when they issue my other ten floors.
A11TWPMDQUO6V2 B009HKL4B8 3 1351987200 45 I am addicted to this game I uninstalled a few games just to keep up with this one free is really worth it.  but I want some lifesyle points.  they need  to lower the prices on some items so for now I give three stars
A11TZM2KT3KL1B B00BWBHIUG 5 1400371200 59 This is a great clean app for children. I like that there aren't any ads popping up, and this game is generous enough that she can play for hours and still add new things to her reef. Only thing that would improve this game is to have voice included for children who are not yet old enough to read.
A11TZM2KT3KL1B B00FAS0MY6 4 1404777600 60 Fun game much like tribes, only better. My only complaint really is that everything is very small. I have a kindle fire hdx 8.9 and have the screen zoomed in as far as it will go and its still very small. Anyone with vision problems may have some issues with the text size. Other than that a very beautiful game!
A11TZM2KT3KL1B B00G5LQ5MU 4 1397347200 38 The only thing that I really dislike about this game is that it forces the player to like it on Facebook and/or rate the game for a free hint rather than offer them or pay for unlimited hints.
A11U0ZTPB8XDQV B00CF34B2I 5 1372204800 37 This app is awesome and would and have recommended it to others. I really like that I can pay it on my xbox and still play it on the go now. Can't say it enough Awesome app.
A11U0ZTPB8XDQV B008B88LEU 5 1356652800 37 Please fix the rotation ability for this game because on the kindle fire hd it will rotate the opposite direction that you have it in. Other than that it is an addicting game and I love it
A11U0ZTPB8XDQV B00BUQBQN8 1 1393632000 45 Why is it that all of a sudden the etsy app is now saying that there is a connection issue even though I am on WiFi ???? Please fix this for the kindle fire HD. I really miss not being able to use this app
A11U3RKY58XL5I B00GINENG0 4 1397865600 26 My kids 6 &3 love talking tom.  I'm amused by it as well.  It closes often and needs restarted.  We play it on Kindle fire hd.
A11U572PMUFE7G B004R7C0QY 4 1398470400 426 Pros:- No nonsense advertising or add-ons- Informative information from multiple forms of media for many animals- FAOTD saves you $3.99- Ability to share your sightings with others and/or save them to a "Life List" (optional sign up)- Using this as a hiking/sighting guide like diary is possibly one of the coolest features.  A nice little implementation for this app- Works smoothly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9- Examples of animal "voices" (sounds) are clearCons:- App's orientation control does not operate on all menu lists, leaving those with locked orientation settings in a constant spin the tablet game- Other than the text information, Internet connection will be required for regional, voice and photo information- Synchronizing this app ahead of time is not an easy task.  You are not able to sync it by region alone and then head off into the wilds.  If where you are going has no access to the internet, then plan to access each possible species of animal ahead of time, you will lose access to most of the useful and interesting information without doing this, or being connected to the web.- The number of mammals listed just in my region alone (north-west) totaled only 137.  I swear we have just that many on the endangered list, so the list is rather scant.  This is a little troubling imo since it's been over 2 years since other reviewers have mentioned the need to expand the library of mammals for this app- As said by many others, the lack of in-app navigation tools is frustrating.  Instead of just tapping an in-app button to go "back" to a previous screen or having a "home" button in the top corner all the time, you are required to open up your side bar and use your tablet/phone's back key.This can easily be a keeper for those with children, or avid hikers.  Make no mistake, this will not be your "bible" reference for all animals, but it will make a nice companion when you are out and about and are curious.  Children might find this app enjoyable, however they will quickly become frustrated if they have no internet connection as this app then becomes merely a text book reference guide with little else.  There is great deal of promise for this app, and the uses for it are exciting to the nature lover.  Should the developer ever make it easier to sync your app by region for exploration off-line an expand the overall content of the number of species this would become a 5 star app without question.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0092S4WLY 4 1366588800 102 I found this puzzle game/app enjoyable.  More perhaps because I persevered through the levels without searching on the net for a solution.  The only drawback I found to this game is the lack of levels.  For the lack of Re-playability alone sets my rating at 4 stars and not 5.  Re-playability is essentially non-existent.  Like watching a suspense/mystery movie you've already seen.I also found having only 8 levels a little disappointing.  But I must admit, for FREE it was indeed fun while the levels lasted.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.  No IAP offers found.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00C7TAF3Y 5 1368230400 126 Can't give this one enough praise.  It's probable the best table app game I've ever seen.  You get this faint spider-web like symbol while levels are loading - be patient, this games demand on the graphics and RAM are high.  Although short, considering the quality and time and effort that went into the production of this game (which is evident) I had no problem paying 99 cents.Should this app ever be offered as the FAOTD then EVERYONE with a device capable of playing this game should definitely DL it.  There are no IAP requests, and an internet connection is not required to play.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked very well with no problems other than the load time for the levels.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AOF15V4 1 1367366400 131 I'm not new to monopoly... Far from it.  I must say this version of monopoly does not deserve the brand-name of Monopoly in the slightest.  Probably the biggest Hasbro/EA flop ever when it concerns a TOY HALL OF FAME classic game.Why would the rent collected equal the amount paid to buy the property?  Why would it take a dozen or so landings on a rental to recover the cost of building hotels?  Why is my income from other sources 10 times higher than it is with my dozen properties?  OH WAIT!!!!!!  I get it..... The trick to winning this game is buy properties but DO NOT IMPROVE them.  Game beaten on all levels of play.  That was easy.Deleted.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0067VKQLE 5 1367366400 80 Don't let the title of the game throw you off.  Yes it does have a lot to do with plants and zombies, but it's not your ordinary zombie game.  No blood.  No Gore.  It's rather fun.  Oh, almost forgot to mention, there is ZERO solicitation in this game for a user to buy virtual cash.  Why is that?... cause there is no virtual money.  You buy this game, you get the game, the whole game and nothing but the game.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0066T8SDU 1 1370390400 257 What's up with the pricing on this app?  Pricing has been noted from various reviews from as low as free, and as high as today's pricing of 10 bucks.  Seriously?  10 bucks for a game app?  I'm not buying the physical game with the purchase of this app am I?Just last week I saw this app for $4.99 and I thought I would buy it by the end of the weekend when I got home.  Then the price doubled.  I guess all those updates that people are complaining about have to be paid for by someone.  I don't see me paying TEN TIMES the going rate for a game app, not when so many reviewers (as recent as today) have professed their disappointment with EA's uncertainty with their updates.Until the pricing is brought in line to a more reasonable level, and the issues are rectified, I am going to pass on this blunder of an app.Update, well this app is now 4.99, again.  But considering they give it away for free in the Google app store I question the ethics behind the price.  Electronic Arts is the developer and seller for both app stores, so why the price difference?  Back to Words With Friends through facebook, which works great for me.  Just the very fact that players will delay games because of "ratings" drives me nuts when I play scrabble for free directly on facebook.  I see no reason that would entice me to pay 4.99 for something that others get for free from another app store.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00JVZ0DQG 4 1400371200 1492 **************************************************************  HOW TO OBTAIN A MAJOR GAME UPDATE - WORK AROUND **************************************************************Many people are posting that they are unable to play this game as of today because the game asks you to click on a button to download the update.  This link is meant for the Google App Store and not the Amazon App Store.  If you are using any version prior to 5/31/14 version 1.7.77 on a Kindle or through the Amazon App Store, you need to REMOVE/DELETE the game completely from your device.  I also ran into issues with the cloud trying to download the old app, so I deleted it permanently from my Amazon App cloud (by signing in directly to Amazon through a web browser and not the Amazon App store or my device's app management features).DO NOT WORRY - Your last "online" game-play will NOT be lost.Once you download FarmVille 2: Country Escape again, you may have to run through part of the tutorial until it asks you to log into Facebook.  After you log into Facebook, you may be instructed to FORCE CLOSE/FORCE STOP this app and then re-enter the app.  This app does not exit cleanly and in order for it to register your device to your Facebook account it needs to be restarted after you FORCE STOP it.This should solve most of the problems Kindle/Amazon players are having with regards to Zynga's system-wide update across multiple platforms.**********************************************************(updated app review below - June, 9th, 2014)I have struggled with the review of this game app for a few weeks now.  Constantly trying to be honest and open minded.  It has taken a while to catch onto this new kind of game-play where experience is earned from filling orders or quests only.  Simply growing any crop when you want will not earn you experience and only cause your inventory to become crammed to such a capacity it's like a puzzle getting it back into a functional state.If you are a fan of Farmville 2 on Facebook, then you will likely be a fan of this little app. I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and found this app ran very smoothly without any freezing or crashing. The app itself can actually be played offline, and it will save itself to the Zynga cloud servers the next time you connect to the internet. It did not always exit cleanly however they have since implemented an exit feature you activate from your device's home icon and using your back button.Playing this game offline is a very nice feature - allowing one to still perform actions on their farm until they can access the internet.  So taking Farmville 2 Country Escape on a road trip or camping (etc) is a viable option.  Obviously you will miss out on some content (marketplace, co-op, friend gifting and help) while offline.  But you won't miss out on tending to some farm functions that might ready to be repeated or altered for long times, thus saving you waiting x amount of time after you get online.The music and sound FX can also be muted individually.Storage/Inventory capacity is currently a large issue. I suspect this might be one of the game's features that will be looked into and changed. Water is unlimited, so waiting for wells to replenish is no longer a factor. One issue I have with storage is items used to expand your barn (nails/shovels/padlocks) are counted against your inventory capacity.  At a capacity of 110, in order to expand your farm you will need 5 padlocks, 11 nails, and 4 shovels.... 20 items in all.  That's a huge chunk of your storage capacity held up until you get all your items, and often you'll exceed the needed number for example nails by several, yet still need 2 more padlocks.  Players are unable to destroy partial amounts of an inventory item, you're sort of held hostage and your game-play actually slows down considerably in this situation.  I have learned not to "seek" out barn expansion items until I'm ready to dedicate myself to that one goal.  Trying to multitask barn expansion with completing progression quests is sure to frustrate you.Currently there are issues when it comes to being able to buy and sell in the marketplace and some players have noted that their items just are not selling even though their prices are marked the lowest.  I too personally have experienced this and question the implementation of such a narrow random selection of prospective buyers/sellers when there is no "banker" like vendor in which you can sell everything to, as one would when playing the PC version (Facebook).  It is also frustrating trying to buy a specific item and the 20 global sellers available to you do not have one for sale all day long.  Although this random list refreshes every 5 minutes, it still hinders a player in a mobile app that is likely to be used for a minute or two here and there throughout the day as time permits.This is definitely a welcomed addition to my Kindle app collection and despite the few flaws regarding the app being a complete pig on memory and power I still think it deserves serious consideration.This app will not permit multiple players to play on the same device.  Once you sign into Facebook with the app, it will be permanently be linked to that account.  If you do this to a phone and a tablet, both will be linked to the same email account.  The only way to switch Facebook accounts after that, is to remove the app completely from your device and then download it again.  Run through the beginning part of the tutorial until it asks you to link to a Facebook account.  It will then pull up your last saved game from ONLINE play.The game has a very high requirement for memory.  But this should come as no surprise to anyone that has played FV2 on a PC.  Just keep this in mind if your device scrapes the bottom of the barrel when it comes to operating apps effectively.The GREED FACTOR from the developer of this application is out of line.  The pressure to have users of this app invest money into an app that it becomes almost unplayable without IAPs (well maybe more of a struggle running uphill).If you're lucky enough to score some free apps that offer Amazon coins during a promotional weekend with the Amazon App Store, then making IAPs isn't so bad.  I grabbed 1,000 coins this past Memorial Day Weekend and then used those coins to buy Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for 6.99 because they were giving away 2,000 coins with each purchase.  Each coin is worth 1 penny.  I ended out having 2,300-2,400 Amazon coins without having to spend a dime.  So keep your eyes open for special offers of Free Amazon Coins if you really love FV2.  The game becomes much more enjoyable with the investment of In-App purchases but in all honesty you shouldn't need more than $10-20 worth of keys if you use them for crafting stations/crop plots only.  I would suggest not using them to speed up time as most of the time when I have tried this, I have not obtained a "rare" item when I used the maximum appropriate farm hands.Stability issues have improved, and considering the game does become much more enjoyable with some IAPs, I am increasing my previous rating to 4 stars.  If you're allowing a child to use this app, ensure that your device's settings require a password to make IAPs.  A single IAP can range from as little as $.99 all the way up to $99.99.The game gives the feeling of still being it's beta stage.  A sense is felt that changes could occur to the entire marketplace or as additional content is added.Chat content is restricted to your Co-op chat (group of 50 players that form a cooperative and work together) with tiny text messages limited to 64 characters.  Chat between your Facebook friends that are not in your coop is not possible within this app.  Adding Co-op members to your Facebook friends is also not easily done without sharing your real profile information over the Co-op channel.  Currently the only information shared to other players in this game is your first name and last initial.  So unless your Name is "Ice T", I doubt anyone will figure out who you really are.Using this app in conjunction with your Facebook/PC Farmville 2 game is great (assuming you play that too) because you are able to send up to 15 water every 12 hours back to your PC farm.  You PC/Facebook is also able to send up to 9 non-special raw items to your mobile farm every 12 hours.Even if you don't like the mobile version at least it can still be used as an easy way to gift 15 water to yourself without having to beg Facebook friends to send you water.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AA0TOG6 5 1368230400 130 Definitely worth the price.  Get beyond the video commercials and this game is a laugh.  I am consider upgrading to the paid version, and that's after only 2 levels.---------------Update - A little disappointed but I guess I should have read the description a little closer.  This is only a 4 level demo.  A bit short imho.  I liked playing the game but I just didn't have enough time to make a determination if I wanted to buy the full version for 2 bucks.Since I didn't have to pay for this version my rating of 5 stars stands.  No doubt it would be much lower had I paid for the full version only to feel ripped off by only getting 7-9 more levels.Kindle Fire HD 8.9 worked fine with this app
A11U572PMUFE7G B007K8RFJ4 5 1373500800 184 How this app works is it communicates directly with the Roku website site, just like your Roku device does over the internet, and changes your channels or performs your inputs that way.  You must have the ability to access a WiFi connection.  We misplaced our roku remote for a few days and this was a great app to have in the interim.  When your batteries die in the middle of the night, running to a late night convenience store is not the best place to find batteries considering the price they hit you with, and the looks you get due to your fuzzy slippers.Having it available for free is a no brainer.  You cannot go wrong.  If you own a Roku this is a must have app.  You don't even have to install it on your Kindle - you can just keep it on your cloud until you need it.  Who knows if they will ever charge for this app later, might as well grab it for free now.  I would have paid a few bucks for this app when I misplaced my remote.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0069EAMUY 4 1368230400 129 Very much like the online game Word Whomp.  I found many of the 3 letter words not recognized by the game that are indeed words.  Instead of using dictionary.com the game uses wikitionary.com.  The problem with this decision by the developers is that anyone with access to the internet can edit wikitionary.com.  I found the 10 second timer warning a little annoying and really wished that there was a way to turn off that sound effect only without muting all sounds.I picked this app up from the FAOTD.... Had I paid for this app I probably would have rated it a 3 since I got a repeat jumble after only three rounds in the same game.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B004DM1OAQ 4 1366588800 235 It is important to note that this app is free.  It works well on the Kindle and is definitely worth downloading if you're interested in backgammon even slightly to improve your technique or learn the game itself on a BASIC level.  Although there are 5 levels of AI skill, I found that the moves the AI performed questionable at level 5.  I would rate the maximum level of the AI skill far below any officially world recognized player.  The skill level of the AI is mediocre at best.  In response to some of the other reviewers comments regarding the frequency of doubles in this app there is 'some' validity to their statements.  However I found that the high double roll rates were divided equally between myself and the AI.  I found that the rate of doubles (normally 1 in 6 chances) was only slightly higher at 1 in 5.  With such a small margin between the two ratios I must therefore admit that the RNG (random number generator) is indeed random.If you an advanced player, or world ranked player - don't bother with this app, it will only frustrate you, as if you were playing a novice.  Although that at times can provide it's own challenges due to the unpredictability of their logic or lack of.Bottom line, worth the price of FREE.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B008MEM24S 5 1365984000 66 My kids and I love this one.  They can't get enough of it.  Could be partly due to the fact that Phineas and Ferb is their favorite show but also the challenges are set up in such a manner that if you're stumped, you just skip it and move on.  With so many levels and so many ways you receive &#34;achievements&#34; it's well worth the price.
A11U572PMUFE7G B005V1N71W 5 1373500800 125 I am not going to rate the Pandora website, their music selection or how they operate.  This rating is for the application only.  I suspect those wanting to get this application already know about Pandora, they don't need me to rate the website.My wife enjoys this application more than I do since she's the one with the Pandora account.  She's able to listen to her Pandora music even while she uses her Kindle to read a book.  I would have been happy if this app had to open with no other app running, providing it worked.  But this app goes beyond and has earned the 5 star rating hands down.  My wife is VERY happy with this app.Works well on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AKKTDJY 1 1368489600 151 ---- Updated Review ----**** BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES **** PLAYFIRST does not Play FairI was curious at first as to why so many people were upset with the developer of this app.  When I bought this app it was FREE on the "Free App of the Day" promotion.  For the few days that I and my daughter played it, it was a full version.  At the time I was thrilled with the game.Now, they want an additional payment to open up the levels beyond level 6.  All the reviews posted here that speak of a "bait and switch" are absolutely correct.  It almost borders on misrepresentation which goes against Amazon's Seller Policies and Agreement.  So the overall ratings gained my 5 star input at first.  Hopefully buyers read through the reviews to see just how many former 5 star ratings are not being counted as they should... a big fat 1 star.
A11U572PMUFE7G B005ZXWMUS 5 1368230400 141 Forget the opinions about the name &#34;Netflix&#34; and the content they offer or do not offer nowadays.  My review is on the app only.Only downside I have is you use slide scrolling spinners to locate movies in various categories.  Not all categories are listed that are listed on the website using a browser so if that becomes an issue just flip to your tablet's browser to search if you have to.  You can look up movies by name using this app.  Never experience a pause, skip, out of sinc audio or bad video feed yet.  I use this all the time at work and at home when I don't want to disturb my sleeping wife.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems... no problems ever.  Maybe the developers have updated the app since it's launch.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00A0YXZVW 4 1368230400 198 All the praise this game gets is well deserved.  Only thing I think that needs to be said is the game pretty much comes to a non-ending right around the time you want to level up your lodge to level 4 and 5.  You'll be very short on bricks at this stage (you'll have TONS of money and food) to complete the quests needed to level your lodge.  But if you make those IAPs to get the bricks, then what?  Your horses have already won all the races, you've already bought all the good horses.  As a matter of fact, I got to level 38 in under 24 hrs, bought an epic horse and won all the races there was to win.  There is a breeding facility but since I was already at the non-endgame no point waiting around 18 hrs to see what the result was going to be.Get rid of the IAPs.  Allow more zoom capabilities to encompass the entire ranch, offer more content (cities) and adjust the resource settings and this game would be worth purchasing without the IAPs or Facebook connection.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0096A9QXC 3 1398297600 213 Pros:- Attractive game for young players- Runs smoothly on Kindle Fire 8.9- playable off-line- FAOTD is possibly the only reason people will get this gameCons:- repetitive game play- constant in-app purchasing (IAP) options- Facebook/Twitter links for little reward- fails to utilize Facebook as a means to permit competition between friends- Paid for application contains in-app purchasing (when not the FAOTD)- purchased items can be used up exceptionally quickly- Game Circle add-on (why do developers even include this garbage?)- Levels (even the first level) are designed to keep players from earning 100% stars without using up IAP itemsATTENTION PARENTS! - Please be fully aware that disabling the ability to make IAPs is my recommendation if you turn your phone/tablet over to your child.  I know this ability is possible on the Kindle Fire HD and I honestly hope it is also available to you.  The addictive nature of this game is unlikely to exceed the teenager market, so I suspect that is Playmous' targeted audience and consumer.  Unfortunately we, as the parents are the one's stuck with the bill at the end of the month.This is unlikely to be a keeper for most FAOTD hunters.  A time killer for a few hours easily, beyond that, I suspect it will be forgotten by the weekend.
A11U572PMUFE7G B005FYBN1G 3 1369008000 90 There is quality in this game and even some physics that went into the thought of the mechanics of the game.  However I found the thumb controls for this game too clunky.  Even as a hard core PS3 gamer that I was, it just wasn't going to work out for me.  I tried it out as the FAOTD and last under 5 minutes before deleting it.  I'm most certain I would be a little hard on the review if had of paid 99 cents.Worked fine on the Kindle Fire HD.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00975HIYU 3 1366588800 76 Like any other slot game I suppose.  Includes fun bonus games.  The one drawback I find (and a large drawback at that) is the very small rate of coin replenishment you get over time for free, 100 coins.  Had it not been this low I suppose the rating of this slot game would have been a 4 star.  The win ratio on this game is not that high so expect to see your coins vanish quickly.
A11U572PMUFE7G B006D1ONE4 5 1368230400 169 It didn't take long for my little one to find this game fun and entertaining.  It makes the player actually THINK.  I highly recommend this game for anyone from 10 up to and including adults.  Below age 10, the little ones might find some of puzzles beyond their grasp.  Some of the puzzles require dexterity and speed while other puzzles require you to think beyond what is in front of you.  Basically a game on how to manipulate the environment so that your water will fill up Swappy's (the good gator) bathtub.It should be noted that if you tried the free version and found the dozen puzzles (give or take) too hard, pass on this game.  The puzzles get harder and harder and harder.  But for me and the little one, that was a way for us to work together and figure out a solution (or let her think she figured it out LOL).I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game works extremely well with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0066WJLU6 1 1390435200 56 Here is the long awaited flashlight app that wants access to your camera.  As a bonus the developer has thrown in something that will be identified as malicious.  Point your kindle at what you want to see and this little app will also try to see what it is you're looking at through your Kindle's camera.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00CN8BTV6 4 1368403200 188 Simple solitaire app to use if you want to play the classic version of solitaire (draw 3).  Other than muting music or sound effects there are no other options you can select for this game.  There is a scoring system that has been implemented for no apparent reason, as it is not accumulative between hands nor does it retain the high score - thus I see no point to scoring the game, you either win or you don't.  The music is like listening to really bad and really old elevator music and there is no way to select another variety of music.  That got muted quickly.With all that said, if what you're after is a simple get in and get out card game to pass a few minutes, this certainly will do the job.  Moving the cards from one pile to another is easy as a click or you can drag them.Had this game cost anything I would have rated it 3 stars.  Since it was free I will give it 4 stars for value.I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and the game worked without any problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B008JJM88Q 4 1370476800 283 I picked up this game up as the faotd.I was leery downloading this app due to one permission listed in the permissions:  "Access the list of accounts in the Accounts Service".  After reviewing the Amazon description/help page regarding permissions, I realized that Amazon is just as vague when it comes to describing permissions as politicians are when answering direct questions.  Maybe Amazon will update their help page on that someday.I am not sure how the mechanics work with this application but it left me, and the rest of my close family, bewildered as to how Akinator was able to figure out who we were thinking of.  Probably the most enjoyment and laughter I experienced was when my daughter started playing around with the game.  Her reactions of disbelief in the abilities of Akinator's perfect guessing of some of the most obscure people/characters had both my wife and I laughing hysterically in another room, from where we were able to hear her frustrations.  Definately a lot of fun can be had from this game.  Although I'm not sure about the longevity of the application's use for adults however it might offer teens and tweens a lot of fun for a while when they are together or alone.I found only one minor error when playing and that was it guessed an actor's character name instead of their real name.  But this only occurred once.I would have rated this game 5 stars, but the one permission required and the pricing.  Since I don't really see this game lasting over a few weeks on your Kindle, I see no reason for the developer wanting more than a buck.Works without any issues on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9
A11U572PMUFE7G B00E4PSG7G 4 1377129600 115 Graphics are nice, and the scenarios are decent for a tablet/phone app.  I had some trouble with the controls.  I figured over time I would get the hang of the controls.  I'm not a huge fan of driving games but I think for a tablet/phone app this one might be one of the better apps that offers realism.  The sequences you are given are quick and challenging.  Not sure if anyone will really learn much about driving in this game but there was some sense of realism when the back end of the car slips out if you take a corner too fast.  Worth a peek for free.Worked well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9
A11U572PMUFE7G B0080SZ0V8 5 1375401600 198 I played this game on the PC from Big Fish and I enjoyed it then.  I was surprised when I found it here on Amazon in the app store but very pleased.  The game is identical to the version you play on your PC and worth the $1.99 price.  If you a puzzle solver and enjoy a little logic, I think you might enjoy this game.  Now keep in mind that I picked this game up as the FAOTD.  I could tell you I would have paid $1.99 for the application, but in all honesty I'm not so sure I would have given this a 5 star rating had I paid 2 bucks.  If you're getting this free, it's a no brainer.  If you paying full price you might find this game rates around the 4 star mark.The playing time of the game seems to be over 2 hrs which I like to consider a benchmark for any game that costs money to be a mark they must achieve.  Worked very well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Easy to understand, and the game does a good job explaining the tasks required to complete the goal at hand.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0051UP5NQ 1 1395619200 241 After seeing this 14.99 app as the FATD, I figured that I would take this opportunity to verify all the negative reviews for myself.The first thing that I noticed was the app's file size is twice the size than what was stated. It also, to this day, despite many grievances about a fonts package, asks me if I want to DL it.  Maybe I expect too much from the most costly app I have ever seen, but personally I would have expected fonts to be included.After playing around with it for a bit I realized that trying to create word documents on a tablet is painstakingly slow at best.  Not practical, especially considering Internet access is required to do anything.  Tried to save my 'test' document as a docx file but it converted it to a pdf file instead.Tried to EXIT or CLOSE the app but was unable to find such a complicated feature.  Ran another program app to observe its behaviour and noticed that it was accessing my calendar and my web browser for no good reason.  Also noticed this app starts itself automatically upon booting your device and immediately goes to work on reading email, browser history, app history, contacts.Uninstalled this app and determined that previous reviewers showing concern for their privacy and the questionable marketing practices are indeed warranted.  As someone already mentioned, FREE is too much to pay for this app considering what permissions you must grant.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00FGFVMGA 4 1387238400 127 Great graphics for a mobile device app.  Decent story and logical progression to the way one goes about solving various puzzles/obstacles.  Only downside to this app is that it left me wanting another chapter or two to the game.  Good for about 2 or 3 hours of gaming.This is not a HOG, perhaps the best way to describe this game's play style is to group it into one of the Nancy Drew mystery games (if you've played those on Big Fish Games).  If you like solving puzzles (not jigsaw) then this game might be right up your alley.Worked great on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Only lost 1 star because I found it a little shorter than I would have liked to see for a paid app.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00CO4KGYA 5 1381276800 96 I enjoyed this game app immensely.  Although I wish there were more levels, there was plenty of enjoyment and repeatability on each level.  Used on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with no problems at all.  Easy game to pick up and put down without worrying about saving your current progress.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone with a tablet/kindle.  I cannot attest to how well you can aim on a phone due to the size of a phone's screen so that might be something to look into if you're getting this for a phone.
A11U572PMUFE7G B004HGK6FW 5 1365984000 124 This game app brings you more than just the game of Sudoku.  It also brings a simple and easy to use system for keeping track of your working solutions in the game.  Before I played this app, I hated everything related to Sudoku.  Sudoku once was nothing more than writing down numbers, scratching them out, rewriting stuff and re-editing your options until you had a massive mess on a 9 x 9 grid.  Not anymore.  I now place Sudoku at the top of my logic puzzle preferences.I personally see no need to upgrade to the paid version, but that ad is annoying and changes frequently making it even more of distraction.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B007PT3QOQ 3 1368230400 30 Does not work well through facebook.  IAPs a must.  Lasted less than a day on my Kindle.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B004UT6RE0 5 1381276800 73 Without a doubt, this is possibly one of the best little utility apps you can get for your Kindle.  Since knowing exactly what programs are running and what your RAM is being used up by is not easily known on a Kindle, I tried this application out and find it very useful to keep an eye on adware/malware/spyware and any other program that I was not intending to have running all the time.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AA87JGU 4 1368230400 36 Not enough levels, but hey, it was free right?  A little too short to give it 5 stars.  As a matter of fact it had any less levels it would not have been worth the DL.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AESN8XY 5 1368230400 165 I was a little leery about playing this game let alone downloading it at first.  My thought was, OMG what if they think I'm some kind of nut wanting to do something crazy.... STOP.... This game is NOT like that.  You really do take on the role of bacteria/virus/etc and humans are your hosts.  This game is not a how to.... but more of a CDC what if....I played this game all the way through (except I'm still stuck on the Necroa Virus level - Brutal) and have NOT made any IAPs.  Yes, you can beat this game without making IAPs.  All the cheat levels can be opened up without IAPs - mine are.Search the net if your need some strategy although I'm yet to find one site that went from start to finish for all levels so you might be using 3 or 4 different sites through your game play.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had not technical issues with this app.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00B5KHZA2 2 1371340800 263 This app might very well have pretty looking graphics.  But they seem to be images you might see on a fantasy role playing game.  The game is functional but that's all I will grant this app.  The bonus rounds have ridiculously low time limits.  The color tones seem as if they are stuck between vibrant and black and white.  It is like the artists of the images were missing any hues that came across as bright.  As this was the faotd for me, I had nothing to lose when I tried it.  Sadly, for some, if you buy this game and you are a lover of HOG's, I suggest you find another app.  This one will disappoint you.The objects you seek appear as if they were more afterthoughts rather than intended objects for the image.  Other reviewers are absolutely correct when they say that everything is difficult to see.  Save your 1.99 unless you are dead set on any and all HOG's no matter the quality.Some might enjoy the challenge, but I did not see it as a challenging game.  Instead, I found it irritating and poorly designed.  I saw no storyline before I couldn't take the horrible lighting that took away almost all contrast between items.  There seemed little reason why you were seeking these objects in the first place, and had there been an original goal, I doubt the objects sought would have any relation to that goal.If you love pinks and purples with bright points and sparkly dots then maybe this app is for you.Works on the Kindle Fire 8.9
A11U572PMUFE7G B00BHHIWQO 4 1368230400 114 Exactly what you would expect from this game.  Longevity for this game is good as I am still playing it after DLing it a month ago.  The drawback I found in this game is your high score resets every week (same time) to start a new tournament.  That's a real let down when you got a nice score and there is nowhere the game saves your &#34;all time&#34; high score (-1 star for that only bad point).There are IAPs for this game but imho they are not necessary.  Connection made properly and easily to the facebook account if you choose to.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B008VBYN80 2 1368230400 146 I turned off the notifications 3 times and still I was getting almost 100 of them a day.  Talk about annoying!  I don't think it's necessary to give me the SAME notification 25 times in 1 minute.Exciting feel to the game-play and good use of the combat system.  However the Gameloft and facebook site connections only worked half the time and you will not get far in this game unless you play through Social Networking.The sad thing with this game is there was so much promise to the game.  I would have bought this game for 4.99 had there been no IAPs.  It have time management, RPG and building your own lands in the game, but it's the IAPs for this game that kills it.At the point now in the game that without IAPs I have no other alternative to make IAPs.... so I deleted it.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0087TUZII 2 1368230400 70 From the example screenshots of this game I thought this would have been a fun game.  Wrong, the screen shots were zoomed in.  The game is literally unplayable due to the squinting one has to do to see the tiny people and text bubbles.  There is no zoom control.  I have a Kindle fire HD 8.9, so perhaps this might not be an issue with other kinds of android devices.
A11U572PMUFE7G B009G9KFQ0 3 1368230400 109 Not user friendly to change the location setting - for example you want to check out that nasty weather in another part of the country.... Well... not so easy is it....  If you're going to use this app to show you what it's like right outside your window, or what the weather will be (hour by hour even) at your current location, then sure, this is a good app.  But don't think changing the weather report is as easy as one click away like they suggest.Has a lot of promise - it's just not there yet.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B007TKT2SK 5 1369180800 38 No need to be original reviewing this app, I liked it so much that I wanted to make sure it got my rating.  It's possibly one of the best apps I have seen introduced.  Very easy to use.
A11U572PMUFE7G B006OBWGHO 5 1366588800 155 It didn't take long for my little one to find this game fun and entertaining.  It makes the player actually THINK.  I highly recommend this game for anyone from 10 up to and including adults.  Below age 10, the little ones might find some of puzzles beyond their grasp.  Some of the puzzles require dexterity and speed while other puzzles require you to think beyond what is in front of you.  Basically a game on how to manipulate the environment so that your water will fill up Swappy's (the good gator) bathtub.I also purchased the full version of this game - out of all the apps I have downloaded I think I paid for only 2 or 3 of them.  This app being one of them, and I do not regret it.  Repeatable enjoyment on successive game plays.  This might be one of the few apps you download to your Kindle and never delete it.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00FAPF5U0 5 1385078400 199 There are issues with this app.  It tends to lose connection even when my kindle has connection.  Receiving tickets to advance tends to not come as quickly as the tickets are sent by your friends.  You are not able to utilize any extra moves that might be sent to you, and I'm yet to see any bonus power ups available to me on the kindle version that were sent to me for levels I've become stuck on.  Logging out of facebook or connecting to facebook almost seems as if the selection process takes more stylus touches than actually entering my user name and pw, are you sure you want to sign out, you sure, really sure, really really sure.......... sign out already!All that said, I'm very glad there is a version of this for the Kindle now.  sure, it needs work, but considering CCS players that use Kindles had nothing before, I'm happy to say for once, I am not going to remove stars for the negative remarks I've made.  They are minor as I'm sure, this is a work in progress and the developer might have been rushed into releasing something before the next Kindle generation comes out.
A11U572PMUFE7G B009HKL4B8 5 1368230400 30 I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game works extremely well with no problems.  I was not inundated with that many IAP offers which was a nice surprise.
A11U572PMUFE7G B007ZGO7EM 5 1368230400 91 SUPER BIG calculator!  What more could a person want to go with their old and aging eyes?  Fat fingers?  No problem.  No internet connection - no problem.  My wife loves this app when shopping.  She said the ability to go back and edit certain entries is awesome and handy.  Personally I just buy what I want and they tell me what to pay.... Could explain why I'm not allow a check-book LOL.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.  No IAP offers found so far.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00ET47USI 4 1403654400 341 Overall, the functionality of this Spider Solitaire app is probably best suited for tablets.  The nature of this game can have columns of cards extending down quite a ways (especially in 4 suited play), so the developer has not allowed for much space for edges/borders around the screen.  If you have overlay applications that show up at the top of the screen, this will definitely be an issue.  The game has options to mute/change the music as well as adjust the color/theme scheme of the board.  However, your color selections are limited to just a few colors that appeared dull or did not always offer a good contrast from the card backgrounds to the table.There were no adds but it does connect to game circle.  Personally I'm not a fan of Game Circle as it offers me little benefit, but for those that enjoy what Game Circle has to offer, it is there.The movement of cards can be annoying at times when it does an automatic selection for you by the way you tap your screen, however, this is easily corrected with the BACK button.  The overall sense of this application is somewhat basic, however do not mistaken the lackluster appearance for poor quality.  This app functions very nicely, and I would give up bells and whistles any day for an app/game that functions as designed.This game ran smoothly on my KFHD 8.9.  The app also closed/exited cleanly.This application can be played WITHOUT internet connection!  (Great for road trips/power outages).I am sure there are free apps for spider solitaire out there.  But I'm also sure that there are undisclosed coding added to those free apps, and taking that into consideration, I would easily pay $0.99 and not have to contend with privacy issues.  If you're lucky enough to snag this as the FAOTD then do it!For the lack of fancy graphics and poor bordering for smaller devices I give this app only 4 stars.  This is not a huge issue, and can be fixed with an update at a later date.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00BSW0M34 4 1365984000 130 Good game for the kids to teach them economic management skills.  The only downside to this game is how easy it is to accidentally spend gems.  If they ever include a confirmation pop up when you spend gems this game would then get a 5 star rating from me.  It plays much like some of the farm, restaurant games on social media sites but has a few twists.  There are quests for each level you reach that you can choose to complete for major experience.  I think this is a work in progress and more will be added later, but you can definitely have a ton of fun without spending any real money on in-game purchases if you have the patience.Using redeem code 'GREATDAY' will grant you gems/diamonds for free.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0089Z3D02 1 1387238400 48 I am sure the app offers what it says, I only wish it also stated that it DOES NOT WORK on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablets.  Maybe they will update this app in the future, but as of today it still does not work for 8.9 users.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00G9B1MEM 4 1396051200 409 As a FAOTD, I found this game somewhat enjoyable.  However it most certainly is not going to ever become the next Candy Crush or FarmVille as the lure of this game just isn't there for adults.  As a FAOTD, it's worth the download for a little time killer, but I do not think I would have purchased it for myself.  Due to the complexities of the quests, I suspect this game is best suited for ages 10+ but the content is fine for all ages.  If you have kids, this might very well be the app you want to have on your kindle for those long road trips to keep them occupied.I question an app presented without any in-app purchasing from Zynga as to just when they implement it (only app I have seen them have without it).  I can see this changing in the future after you read their terms of service:"1.3 You understand that while at times you may "earn" "buy" or "purchase" (a) virtual currency, including but not limited to virtual clay, coins, cash, tokens, or points, all for use in the Application; "No Exit/Quit feature - The elusive and complicated feature that most games/apps are able to implement/include has escaped the developer.  One would think that a paid app would include this, maybe the FAOTD version doesn't get it.  I had to force close this app that consumes 179 MB.  Quite the memory hog for an app that doesn't shut down.  If you are not familiar with "force closing" applications and your tablet runs slow after you play this game, you can bet this is your issue.  Simply reboot your tablet.Instructions - The tutorial will get you going, but more detailed information could have been included (ie what each type of power-up's function is).  After searching the web I found detailed instructions on "Fat Pebble's" parent company's website, those needing better instructions can find them by searching on Bing or Google for "player support clay jam zynga" and that should bring up the zynga instructions for their game.Some will hate this game, and some will love it, my review is pretty much based on quality, lasting appeal, and the like.  Personally I don't see me calling this one a keeper (meaning I will likely delete it within a week).This game worked fine (other than not closing itself properly) on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  This game also works offline (at the time of this review).
A11U572PMUFE7G B009WJNXAE 3 1368230400 92 At first, it was a lot of fun winning and playing bingo with a twist.  But after an hour it became clear that my early wins were thrown to me - or seemed that way to get me sucked into IAPs.  After that first hour I hardly ever got a bingo.  Perhaps that was just bad luck, or maybe there was something more to it than what I can prove.  I'm glad I made no IAPs for this one.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B007OXASB2 4 1369008000 152 My youngest one loves animals.  And this game has her playing my Kindle Fire HD more than I care to admit... Which reminds me I should activate those time limits (lol).  This game is for the younger market in mind, and that honestly concerns me a little.  As there are a lot of IAPs (in app purchases) that can be made.  The game is played online and you can visit other players' pet shops (although I don't think there is actual communication between the people, you just get to check out other pet shops.Lost Ratings - I would rather have paid 3.99 or 4.99 outright for this app and owned it without restrictions as to what you can buy with FAKE game money (not virtual money) or earn.  Having to worry about IAPs being made by parents when it is their children playing this game is a little questionable to me imho.
A11U572PMUFE7G B004XQYBA2 5 1395705600 388 I picked this app up a little while back as the FATD.  Not many apps that I get are keepers.  This one is a keeper.I have seen a lot of Sudoku apps and this is by far the best.  I honestly don't think a better app could be created for the game.  Even if you hate Sudoku, you might find you enjoy it with this app.  I'm not trying to blow smoke up anyone's behind, I'm very serious just how user friendly this app is and how it makes playing Sudoku much more enjoyable.Admittedly the Very Easy puzzles on this app are no cake walk, they offer a challenge rather than the usual mind numbing ridiculously easy puzzles some other apps try to pass off as a puzzle.This app knows how to undo moves (while at the same time, replacing notations that were previously there before a confirmed digit was entered).  It will keep track of your time, paused by you exit out of the puzzle, your average time for the level.  It has a feature that will analyze the puzzle point you are at, and tell you what methods are used to calculate the solution.  This feature will provide you links to those methods where you can learn how to spot the formation and solve them.  Your game can only improve.I am not a huge fan of Sudoku, or rather, I should say I wasn't, until now.  Sure, there are free Sudoku apps out there.  But it would be like trying to compare an orginal Picasso, to a photocopy of a picture of a Picasso.  1gravity has set the bar very high for other app developers.  You will not likely ever want to use another Sudoku app (but this one) once you try it.My puzzle solution times on other apps use to be around 30 minutes (no chuckling).  With this app my solving times are in the 5-6 minute range.  Not because the puzzles are easier (they are actually harder), but it's because this app is so easy to use and so well designed that half your time is not spent fighting with the app... Rather this app really allows you to spend your time solving the puzzle.  Making notations should not be a hassle, and this app makes it easy.This app works without an internet connection.
A11U572PMUFE7G B006P57MUK 4 1368230400 80 Not all of the features are available using this app compared to the website through a browser (ie, games coming soon), but it serves it's purpose.  A little slow to load but I suspect that is Redbox server or the burden on bandwidth due to the amount of images per page.  Other than the page loading being a little slower than I would have liked to see, it works well.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 if that helps anyone.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00IEBE7GK 4 1401062400 274 I played &#34;The Room&#34; and found that first person world of puzzle solving impressive and enjoyable.  I think I found myself replaying it several times before it fell into the forgotten cloud of apps/games.  I could hardly wait for &#34;The Room Two to come out&#34;.  Still impressive and puzzle solving takes a slightly different direction than its predecessor.  The puzzles can be difficult testing your ingenuity and ability to  think about where your next clue might be hidden, or once found, where it is leading you.  The first app was clear a 5 star puzzler that had you thinking for days.  THE ROOM TWO entertained me for about 3 hours without hints.  I felt as if the content was easier in this edition or there was less of it.Exceptional HD graphics that has you immersed into a 3D world (first person view).  Almost double the permissions as the first edition in this series (had only 4 permissions) is only a slight concern but I do not understand for the life of me why a paid app that is not played online against other players needs access to personal information and your wifi networks.  Had the permissions remained at only 4 my ratings would likely have allowed the 5th star, despite the sense of less content.  However with so many apps trying to collect information unnecessarily (especially paid apps) I must ding this app 1 star trying to take more of my personal info while still charging $2.99 for that luxury.I would likely purchase THE ROOM THREE for $1.99, but if the permissions remain the same they had better be calling it THE ROOM FREE.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AEWUQG2 3 1368230400 63 Decent game to kill 15 minutes a day even without making any IAPs.  I found some of the questions that were posed to me a little more difficult than I would have expected from the grade they say they were from.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.Careful of the IAPs with your kids on this app.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00BGAZYLI 5 1365984000 41 Another truly free game!  Had a lot of fun going through all the levels of this game.  Worth downloading this app if you need a game to kill time.  I call this one, restroom companion.  It's levels are FAST to play.
A11U572PMUFE7G B0064X7B4A 5 1366588800 64 Multi-player, turn based game that offers competitive fun for you and your friends.  Highly recommended.  Not a day goes by without me playing this game at least once.  Facebook application and you play with your facebook friends.- Internet connection required- I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.- A stylus makes placement of the words a lot easier.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00JND1LQW 5 1399852800 183 Here's another top notch FAOTD that should not be passed-up.  This game will fall into the logic/puzzle genre and be described as such by many.  I am a logic puzzle fanatic, and I must be honest, I didn't find it pushing the envelope of puzzle solving.  Instead, I saw this game more as a spacial solving puzzle with physics and gravity.  Although the game is presented as only two dimensional, the graphics are nicely done.  The tutorial comes in stages as new elements of the game are introduced on various levels.  The social media links are minor and you have to actually go looking for them instead of having the developer throwing external links at you like rocks to the head.  Music and sound fx can be muted.I found the game mechanics and how it followed basic laws of physics surprisingly good.I also found that FizzPow developers were wise to not post their level walk-through hints as Flash Videos.  Instead, they made sure those without Adobe Flash are able to view their posted videos, big star for the developers foresight on this one.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00BUVPIRS 5 1405296000 1065 I Purchased this app for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 during a promotion, thus getting it for free.  But in fairness to other customers, I will review this app as if I had paid the current asking price of $6.99.The initial loading of the app upon start up does take a moment or two depending on your device's ability to handle large files.  Once running, I found the graphics and sound absolutely amazing for a tablet/phone game.  RAVENSWORD: SHADOWLANDS is about as close as any app I've seen from truly giving someone that virtual experience of open world gaming in an role playing game.  Although the mobs (static monsters) tend to be rather predictable and have limited AI (artificial intelligence), that is expected considering the platform being used is not really meant for AAA games.The storyline and side-quests make sense and do lead you (the character) to continue advancement in the overall storyline or improvement to your character's abilities/items.  There is even the ability to buy a home of your own and furnish it as you wish.Not once did the game crash on me, but I did learn quickly that saving manually before important decision (like leaping over a gap, or fighting a tough looking mob boss) might be prudent.  The game will auto-save your progress as you move from one identifiable area to another, but should you die, this might leave you only a few seconds to redo, or perhaps as much as 30 minutes (depending on how slow you advance through the area).One thing that frustrated me the most was not understanding where to find/buy a lock pick.  For peace of mind, they can be purchased from the general store or the wagon to the West in packs of 10.  The wagon to the west will also buy stolen items, as no other merchant will even consider such items.  Another aspect to the game that may frustrate some players is opening doors that are impossible to pick, but you KNOW you have obtain the necessary item/key to open the door.  To open these kinds of doors when you have the key, simply push/walk forward and the door will open for you.  One might have expected these doors to function like any other door in the game (where a hand symbol appears indicating you wish to interact this the door), but now that you are aware it should no longer be an issue in the game for you.The controls require you to use both hands.  One to control your movement, and the other to control the camera view.  Combat is not a complicated system and it is done in real time.  You can even plan your attacks to perform long range attacks on your enemy, and move/roll sideways to avoid the enemy's arrow/spear attack on you.Difficulty settings can be adjusted to very easy (where you take very little damage from enemies) to obviously more difficult as anytime during game play, even in the middle of combat.  The difficulty setting however does not create or lessen the number of mobs in the game.  There is a lack of spontaneity of NPCs in the game, and most of their actions or dialog are preset.  I even did one side mission where I was asked to help a lady with a problem in her home.  Returning to this same NPC later will result in doing the same task.  Not a huge deal, but it's a small thing that reminds you of the limitations of playing this type of game on a tablet and the need to cut certain things from being altered so that the game is a manageable size and also remains playable without having the RAM bogged down with too many calculations.The mobs tend to be static (appear only in designated locations) at sporadic.  Towns are populated with a handful of people, unlike towns in Skyrim (console game) that often has dozens of NPCs.The music is something that definitely adds quality to this game.  It gives you that sense of being in the Era where swords and sorcery ruled the earth, and dragons ruled the sky.The game offers multiple users to have their own game in progress and also keeps track of all of your previous saves.  This is very handy if your most current save point is not going to correct an issue, you just choose another save point.The game is one player only, and can be played WITHOUT the internet.  This one aspect makes this game worth the $6.99 just for that long car trip across the state/or country for those in the back-seat.  Just don't forget to tell them you're stopping for food, or they might still be playing this game when you come back out.To list any bad points for this RPG/open world (sandbox style) game, would require me to really dig deep and literally nitpick at non-issues.  The quality of this game is second to none for android RPG games.  I have played other RPG games on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game really puts others back 20 years.  The coding used in this app are current and up to date.  In no way, will you feel like you're playing on the old Atari system.  I would put this game at the level close to current PS3/Xbox 360 games.  I have not seen many apps worth more than $0.99, and never have I seen an app worth over $2.99, until now.  RAVENSWORD SHADOWLANDS brought their "game" to the table, and they succeeded.  This game is worth every penny of the $6.99 price considering what you get in such a compact and mobile platform.Personally, I would vote this to be the best game of the year, and I have never said that in my many reviews in the past for an app.  Congratulations to Crescent Moon Games.** For all those 1 star reviewers that were unable to play this game due to their device not having enough storage to download the game or RAM to run the game, I empathize, you really are missing out one of the best apps I've ever seen.  Perhaps issues experienced previously have been corrected, but it is not fair for such a well done app to have such a low rating due to devices that perhaps had too many apps running at one time.  Or maybe I'm just one of the lucky few.
A11U572PMUFE7G B007SYWFRM 5 1368230400 73 My daughter has been playing this one for a while now and still plays it several times a day.  A lot of content for quests and such in this game... even for free this game is a keeper.  However...*** Caution to Parents *** IAPs are very easy to make in this game and even easier to spend... suggest parental locks.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AQ5A88S 3 1368230400 33 Might be an okay game but compared to it's parent Game of Coin Dozer, this one falls short.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game works extremely well with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B008BJQCCM 5 1366588800 147 Even if it's just for Nostalgic reasons, this game is worth downloading.  It is essentially matching pieces of a like shapes (similar to games like Bejeweled). You play the computer, known as WOPR in the movie "War Games".  As you progress through the levels of play, you win memory in which you utilize like currency to buy higher level skills for your next battles.Re-Playability is average since you cannot obtain master level achievements for all levels until your skills are a certain level.  Once you've mastered all levels the re-playability is low.Definitely worth the price of FREE when I got as a FAOTD, might be worth 99 cents, but when I first wrote this review I had in mind I paid nothing for it.no IAP requests was a good point.  No online connection required.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this app worked with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B009LT1YZ6 4 1400284800 207 Last Fish is going to have you either loving it or hating it.  The unusual permissions regarding "bluetooth pairing" enable you to connect a compatible gaming controller (Tinfoot comments answer), and the game being in black and white, the one key factor that will likely sway players to one side or the other is the TILTING controls needed to play this game.  I'm not a fan of playing see-saw or twister with my device.But I know some are huge fans of the tilt controlled games, and those that are will find this game relies heavily on it.  As a matter of fact, it's the only controls you have when actively playing a level.  The graphics are basic.  The game plays smoothly and you can mute both sound fx and music.Even though I am not a fan of tilt games, I must still give credit where credit is due.  This app utilizes the tilt sensor perfectly.  Internet access is not required to play this app.  As a FAOTD, this is a perfect opportunity for you to try out an app that uses the tilt controls/sensors without any risk.  If you've missed the FAOTD, and you're comfortable with this type of game, then it is easily worth the dollar.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00AQCMK32 5 1387238400 442 I grabbed this app as the FAOTD.  I found the few permissions required a refreshing change compared so one app similar to this one released a few days later.  If you've played games like lemonade tycoon or any other game that has you managing a micro-business and enjoyed them, then you will enjoy this one.  The graphics are not spectacular, but they do not need to be, it's the number crunching you play this game for, not the fancy graphics.  The historical evolution on console/pocket sized gaming is rather accurate in terms of the timeline for the 20 year cycle of the game.  Knowing the booms and busts of various gaming consoles will definitely give you an advantage when it comes to your gaming choices.From the moment I downloaded this game, I just could not put it down.  From the hiring, training, designing games, performing out-sourced contracts, firing, attending gaming conventions, awards ceremonies, moving into larger offices, designing my own gaming console.... whew, where did the time go?  I will admit, I'm one of those cheep prime members that grabs the FAOTD and settles for that.  Not many games would I consider worthy to pay for and still hold a 5 star rating.  Game Dev Story is the exception.  For those of you that are considering this game, you need not worry about the price... It's well worth it considering how deep you will immerse yourself into this game once you start.The one thing I really enjoyed in addition to the game is that when you restart your game some stats will be carried over.  There is only one save location so you are not able to have multiple games on this app.  Perhaps this might be something Kairosoft Co. could consider amending to allow 2 or 3 saved games.  After all, a saved game file that takes under 1 second to save couldn't take up all that much memory on my device could it?There was nothing offensive when it came to content.  Other than a few grammatical errors in the game's worded text, I found this game ran very smoothly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  I would recommend this game to all ages, however it might be a little more complicated for the very young.  This app is simple, yet somehow it manages to keep just enough complexities in the game to keep you thinking but not so much as to make you ever think of just calling it quits.This app is a keeper.  Of the hundreds of apps I've downloaded onto my Kindle, I think I have about a dozen I have kept.  This one is one of them.
A11U572PMUFE7G B008Y212PI 5 1381276800 68 Very easy app to use and get the hang of.  It's basically logic puzzles where you are filling in a grid with blocks or empty squares.You have 5x5 puzzles, 10x10, and 15x15.  There is no time limit and you can exit at any time and pick up later where you left off.I found myself passing many hours with this app.  Highly recommended for any puzzler or logic solver.
A11U572PMUFE7G B008Y2FRFO 5 1368230400 110 This is a keeper as a time killer.  You can play this game for a minute, or hours.... that's what makes this game a perfect time killer.  You have a second to kill, or a few hours to pass.Never had to make any IAPs.  Save your Dozer Dollars (DD) from puzzle completions to upgrade your prize sets and you will figure out how to have thousands of coins banked up.  Very addictive.If you get this one for your kids, be absolutely certain you lock your device from unwanted purchases as the DD's are easily spent.I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this game works extremely well with no problems.
A11U572PMUFE7G B00CF6J2G0 4 1368489600 107 This app is a lot of fun.  Worked great on my Kindle Fire HD.  The few minor things I found that prevented this app from making it all the way to 5 stars was:- storyline was too short (Finished the game after a few hours of play)- only a handful of locations in the game- there is a gap in the progression as if a few levels were removed to cut down on programming spaceIt is a little repetitive but keep in mind, it's a penny app not a Hollywood produced console game.  Without upgrading you won't be able to get beyond the first or second location.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B00EUCL6R0 5 1388275200 33 I loooove this game. I used to play World of Warcraft, but haven't been able to for a little over a year. This makes me miss WoW a little less. Very good game.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B008D2QRAO 5 1371254400 22 This slots game is fun to play. It's a slot machine game with a touch of adventure. I like one a lot.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B00CH87HF4 5 1370649600 38 I like this RPG ALOT. I used to play World of Warcraft, but don't have a regular computer set up right now. This game has come the closest to WoW for me. I really enjoy playing this one.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B00AA87JGU 4 1370649600 31 The only downfall to this game I have found is that you have to spend gold coins to open the high levels. Other than that, it's a fun and addicting game.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B00DGXGNQ8 5 1371859200 28 The aiming is a liitle laggy, but overall a fun game. Does get a bit addicting to play. I just want to keep advancing further In the game.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B00CMMR9SU 5 1370476800 26 Very fun and addicting game. It can make you want to pull your hair out in frustration though, which makes you want to play even more.
A11U6DLLA5JRXB B008MM9630 5 1369267200 20 So far I am liking this game. Easy to play and understand. A fun game with decent graphics. A plus
A11U9EIMD4ZRHA B004VCZW60 4 1365811200 26 Pretty good app! I like it so far and it's right on point with the days. A great tracked for someone who is forgetfull like me.
A11U9EIMD4ZRHA B00B2V66VS 5 1367193600 22 This is a very fun game and it's easy to get sucked in when you have too much time on your hands.
A11U9EIMD4ZRHA B004K56MNU 5 1365120000 72 This is a great app for when your curious tobsee other people's talent for writing and you want to know just how competitive the writing world can be. Hundreds of stories, all made by local people (some better than others) and yet it's as if they should've been published. Totally recommend this, it's worth the time.P.S. I recommend your first read should be Red Leather (cover of a girl w/ red lipstick)
A11U9PEHRZKMPW B007KQ6XYY 5 1332979200 81 I'm really tired of all these people saying the original was better. I think it's only important that it does what it is supposed to do. It runs fine, with no lag for me. If you were whining that it s not as fun as the first, you do research. RESEARCH WHAT THE APP HAS! If you think you wasted money, you've only got yourself to blame. I love this app, with all the new unique content! Keep it up, ZeptoLab!
A11UD61PPTWO28 B007XKEY6Q 5 1373846400 41 This is so FUN I am not a great drawer that much which it comes with my finger but I'm not bored that much you get to join Facebook and vs friends and draw so I recommend to get this game
A11UD61PPTWO28 B00B7Y0206 3 1374624000 36 This is a good app I can see all my videos but ( bad part ) anyway whatever I play a video it just freezes in every 10 seconds but it is still a good app
A11UD61PPTWO28 B004WKWU5M 4 1373587200 24 This is really cool I always pretend I was a vampire when I put red eye color it's a really good app it's FUN
A11UD61PPTWO28 B007F1SLC6 4 1372896000 33 It's so cool it's really fun too like you can verse people and sometimes you might win or loose it doesn't matter any way if I were you I rather get this app
A11UH979D3T1O0 B006C4U9RW 5 1333324800 141 Great playlists! Truly expert made! So you feel kind of something today, don't exactly know what it is but somehow out there you know there's a playlist that sums it all. Well lucky you, this is IT. Songza's wide array of song selections are just amazing. You'd  be surprised to know there's actually a song for everything! I use it all the time. Drawbacks?? Yes. Somehow it takes a while to load at first and often disconnects your wifi. I don't know why. It force closes a lot on my Kindle Fire. Kind of annoying when you're so in the mood for a mood. But when it works well, it works well! I'm not depriving it any stars from the selection they have. It's mindblowing what songs they put together. Amazing app! Amazing developers and playlist-makers! -if that's even thing. (*wink)
A11UI2KDVARMSM B0063GORYU 5 1342310400 39 This app is fun and addictive!  I'll be like 'One more game and then I'll do the dishes'  ....  and then it will be two hours later.  I guess I will have to start setting the timer on myself!
A11UIB3Q85LBG B008IJTFYW 5 1399507200 38 This app has saved me from more nights laying awake in places I would not have been able to fall asleep because of the noise outside.  I found a mix that sooths me right to sleep every time.
A11UIB3Q85LBG B0066TUXU6 3 1383177600 47 Hulu plus has some troubles, but better than missing all my favorite TV shows.  Month to month is better than paying for a year if it doesn't  work out. My only wish is that I could get every show for all my Kindle fire,PC, and Smart Phone.
A11UIB3Q85LBG B00768WTXA 5 1359590400 21 I bought this app. to de stress after work.  It sure does a great job of taking me away from reality.
A11UIB3Q85LBG B005OQJG0K 5 1399507200 34 I really like not having to pull down the screen, which most times takes more than one try.  With this app I just tap it and I'm hooked to any wifi in the area.
A11UIB3Q85LBG B006RXD2I6 5 1399507200 44 I can't just watch TV I have to have something else to do so this app gives me a lot of different card games to pick from I play freecell most but I've learned how to play more Solitaire games than I knew existed.
A11UJDWB3L2LUS B007TLOYZU 2 1337212800 31 I liked it for the few minutes it worked. now trying to start a level just closes the game. too bad. fix it and i will raise the rating g again.
A11UJDWB3L2LUS B008MEM24S 5 1346544000 23 this is a pretty good game. even for adults. quick short levels that require brains as well as skill. I like it alot.
A11UJDWB3L2LUS B007Z4AKQI 5 1359158400 36 It's fun because you get to hunt  zombie dear get the hunt bison large bison and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer for a limited time and you can hunt albino animals  like albino  bear moose dear
A11UJDWB3L2LUS B00FZEK72M 4 1405987200 40 Excellent game with a good interface. I like it because it is quick to load and start and you can stop anytime. The in app purchases are augmented by the fact you get more coins just by playing each day.
A11UPVIUXKAJNG B00DRA55DW 5 1376092800 33 I luv this game so much this game is a very fun game to play to be a nail artist and I think they should add more free stuff for the free version
A11UPVIUXKAJNG B00B2V66VS 5 1373760000 35 I luv this game so much the first time I played this game I was on it for hours this game is the best game they have ever made next to minion rush amazing &lt;3
A11UPVIUXKAJNG B006OBWGHO 2 1372032000 31 I think the game is fun but I've restarted this game like 5times and they should really add more levels just like they having the regular game not the free one
A11UPVIUXKAJNG B00A0XOT68 5 1399075200 34 I love this game I LUV tryin LG to guess. The logos and their names but I think that the game should have more levels to it but other than that I lived it
A11UPVIUXKAJNG B00846GKTW 5 1372032000 27 This game really lets me show of my fashion senses all I have to say is bravoI luv this game so much I play it every day
A11UTRXMAEUDE B006D1ONE4 5 1358208000 75 My husband and I love this game! I find it to be a little harder than some of the other games I've played from this category.The game runs very smoothly and new concepts are introduced enough to keep things interesting. The graphics are great and the music is fun to listen to. Where's My Water has plenty of levels and bonuses to keep you busy for a long time!Absolutely worth the 99 cents it costs!
A11UTRXMAEUDE B00CELIPL4 5 1369353600 87 This is exactly what you would expect from a hidden object game. It has several different modes to choose from & the list of items to find changes if you play a picture more than once. That gives the game replay-ability & allows you to choose how difficult you want the game to be!The pictures are very crisp & clear. The screen on my Kindle Fire HD was plenty big enough to see everything clearly. I, personally, enjoyed the animal theme & thought this game was fun.
A11UTRXMAEUDE B004RJMUJO 4 1364860800 152 My family really enjoys playing this game.  It's a lot of fun & we're always trying to beat each other's high score!  Playing with your food has never been so much fun.The graphics are good & the music choice is perfect for this game.  With 3 modes to choose from, there's a game style for everyone.  Also, trying to unlock the different blades & backgrounds can be challenging at times.However, sometimes right before we start a game it freezes for a few seconds (but has always come out of it... so far) & once, while playing, I touched the screen to swipe the blade & it stuck there.  I couldn't do anything, the blade was in that particular spot whether my finger was or not!  Also, the points &#34;rewards&#34; are coupons.  I was expecting an ad-free version (since it's not the free one), & (to me) the coupons are ads in disguise.
A11UTRXMAEUDE B004SBQGHS 4 1358208000 84 I like this game. It's fun and there are plenty of levels to keep you busy for a long time. The secret to scoring the most points is to try to destroy everything, not just the piggies!The graphics are not as good as in other games I've played. I guess that's why it's also offered in HD. It's nice to not have the ads taking up space, though.All in all, it's a good game. I am definitely getting my 99 cents out of it!
A11UUU29IBUASU B00BSW0M34 2 1366761600 160 Game started out as fun...I played as much as my 8 yr old. But now it is INSANE...96 HOURS to build a house??? You can't move on until you build it and then harvest from it. So, for an 8 yr old to wait 4 days for a house to build. PLUS, it took all the coins to buy it to build. I went to the ROVIO web site to see if there was something I was missing on generating coins...it told me to purchase them on the coin tabs!!! And they are much more expensive to purchase then on most other games built for kids and adults. I am bummed we downloaded it and spent all the time. Definitely not on the same level as other games, including Zynga. Very little reward for doing quests. Takes forever. Hard to get money and crystals without purchasing and the purchasing is 2-3x as expensive as other games I have checked out!
A11UYHKU0BAWWV B009PCBEPE 3 1357776000 21 this game is fun. its a good way to pass time when you're bored. i will keep it and play more.
A11UYHKU0BAWWV B0050KEVO6 5 1357776000 20 this game is very fun. it is very simple but a good time passer. i really enjoyed it. download it.
A11UZ8EJO87LE9 B004I744AS 5 1341446400 28 Delightful app, no problems on my Razr, and no problems ever finding exactly the definition I'm seeking, even the more obscure ones.  So grateful to have found this.
A11UZ8EJO87LE9 B004VMUS9G 5 1374710400 50 All the features I need and a seemingly limitless number of alarms permitted.  I like that I can choose a specific song as the alarm sound or have the app choose at random from my music library.  Very complete app with no negatives for me.  I highly recommend this one.
A11UZ8EJO87LE9 B005ZFOOE8 4 1374537600 40 I'm new to I &lt;3 Radio and will add to my review with more listening time.  Meanwhile, I'm happy with  everything, especially the variety on my 'created' station. Also wanted to point out that FACEBOOK is your choice, not required.
A11UZ95GYNKXN7 B008UXIDYE 5 1385078400 28 GREAT APP & IT MAKES READING OR HEARING THE BIBLE EASY WHEN YOU ARE ON THE GO OR JUST WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND READ THE WORD.
A11UZ95GYNKXN7 B0098BGYM0 5 1385078400 26 GREAT TOOL, TO USE INSTEAD OF MS AND IT'S FREE.  YOU CAN ORGANIZE YOUR NOTES, MAKE THEM TAB SPECIFIC AND NOW SAVE IN THE CLOUD TOO.
A11UZ95GYNKXN7 B004H6WTJI 5 1385078400 24 HAVE BEEN USING FOR ABOUT A YEAR AND THIS IS A GREAT APP FOR THE HEALTH CONSCIOUS INDIVIDUALS THAT WANTS TO TRACK THEIR PROGRESS.
A11UZ95GYNKXN7 B0091FQNHO 5 1385078400 21 FUN GAME AND YOU CAN GET CARRIED AWAY PLAYING, BUT A NICE WAY TO RELAX AND UNWIND AFTER A LONG DAY.
A11UZ95GYNKXN7 B00B5DLSMU 5 1385078400 21 GREAT FUN, PLAYING WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY.  HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP YOUR MIND SHARP AND LEARN AT THE SAME TIME.
A11UZ95GYNKXN7 B009VSW15Y 5 1385078400 28 I DOWNLOADED SO THAT I COULD TAKE PICTURES WITH MY KINDLE BUT IT'S BEEN A LITTLE HARD SINCE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHAT YOUR SNAPPING A PICTURE OF.
A11V3CTZH7DE4I B00CWY76CC 5 1377907200 21 Not too hard, not too easy.  Fun way to pass the time and / or getting sleepy. I recommend the game.
A11V3CTZH7DE4I B00EQB80HE 1 1378944000 53 Initial bingo cards free but after you have to pay for more. There isn't a chart showing list of numbers drawn so there is no way to double check. Wants you to sign in through FB so you can hound your friends to play. Nothing unique and other interfaces have more to offer.Uninstalled.
A11V480VOKXYL2 B00AREIAI8 5 1359763200 39 I was not sure my daughter would like this or not, so I took a chance.  She seems to like it BUT WHO CARES??....I LOVE IT!  LOL.  Honestly, really cute game that any girl would love.  Good job guys!!
A11V480VOKXYL2 B00HEFEDAM 3 1398470400 87 I just wish that you could play more often without having to wait for people to send you lives and map pieces.  It takes forever, and it does not seem to sinc up with the facebook on my pc.  I wish there were a 'freeplay' option, but I guess they have to make their money.  If it were 'REASONABLY PRICED' I might consider actually spending money with them, but they just seem greedy.  It's too bad too, this could have easily been my favorite 'Go To' game.
A11V480VOKXYL2 B00B2TET3C 5 1373587200 20 I love this little bingo game!  It's a great way for me to relax for a few minutes before bed.
A11V480VOKXYL2 B00FEMJF6O 2 1398470400 71 I love this game, and was really looking forward to playing this on my kindle, but when it loads it shows the timers on all of my workshops and any quests (ie. the ship and the balloon) at over 2 days! DAYS!  I have tried reloading, and it does not fix it.  I am not sure what the problem is, it looks like I will have to put in a ticket.
A11V9UTFC5LI67 B009HQ9UHC 5 1351468800 24 its so awesome I played it on my other phone and it was so cool it looks hard but it is really not hard.
A11V9UTFC5LI67 B006HUWEHY 5 1346457600 20 It is so fun I have been waiting for it.  now I have the game I played it all day
A11V9UTFC5LI67 B004Z9Y3VY 3 1335916800 22 it seems ok I think I didn't get it but it still should get ok on the free game that some people
A11V9UTFC5LI67 B008OD6QYE 5 1348963200 20 I got this app on my phone there were so awesome I love it. i can play it all day
A11V9UTFC5LI67 B006PH7WBM 4 1352505600 21 It good game for girls that love fashion. It also fun if you play it a lot it gives pretty clothes
A11VAPRE6NXHT7 B008BTX2CA 4 1349827200 62 I have the first generation Kindle Fire but like many here have found the sound only goes so high,  I downloaded other programs that were supposed to make the sound louder but they didn't work.  I tried this one and was very surprized to see a noticeable change for the better.  Well Worth downloading for anyone with the first generation kindle fire.
A11VFACS9WX399 B0089Z3D02 4 1370995200 23 It's good but kind of slow in comparison to playing it on desktop.  Nice to have when you are traveling on the road.
A11VFACS9WX399 B008JGSM6G 3 1373414400 26 It's okay to play when you are tired and don't want to think too hard!!  It's good when you are killing time for a short period.
A11VFACS9WX399 B007NZV2HK 5 1389052800 20 When traveling on long distance bus ride, it is a good game to make the time go quickly.  Have fun!!
A11VFSCYLQ9T56 B00EUCL6R0 4 1379980800 21 Even though your character is not physically moving, it still has dome fun aspects: leveling, improving and learning/unlocking skills,purchasing better equipment.
A11VFSCYLQ9T56 B00IYAG7DM 4 1398643200 28 This game is pretty fun. Could use some extra tutorial when it comes to getting all the bonuses, instead of just selecting randomly and hoping for a bonus.
A11VFSCYLQ9T56 B0091REZMW 3 1385164800 29 A little small on kindle screen, but u can increase the screen some. Only played few hours so far, but enjoy for the most part. Good thing it's free.
A11VFSCYLQ9T56 B008REEKRA 2 1395100800 21 The story reads VERY quickly, too quickly.  I would like to be able to read some of the hints and storyline.
A11VFSCYLQ9T56 B00A4KVFLY 3 1391299200 23 The biggest problem i have with this game is it doesn't show the best answers at the end of the big money round!!!
A11VFSCYLQ9T56 B00CH87HF4 3 1379721600 26 Takes a little getting used to moving around. A little easier sometimes than some other games I've played, but controls sometimes not sensitive enough or intuitive.
A11VJFO7C88NKM B007581DPQ 5 1328745600 24 great app you really have to pay attention to find the items...great idea to combine all the great songs with a visually stimulating game.
A11VJFO7C88NKM B0067QCC70 5 1325980800 29 great game. very beauitful and good story line. unquie game play. make sure you are in scearching mode. Really enjoyed it. you can not go wrong with this game.
A11VJFO7C88NKM B005ZXWMUS 3 1325894400 38 It's usable on kindle Fire, but the picture jitters quite a bit and audio seems to be out of sync and the picture constantly speeds up and slows down. It just needs a little help. Looks great though.
A11VL05XCA5W5A B004GJDQT8 5 1368921600 50 This is a great app for amazoniacs like myself. I love having mobile access to my favorite shopping website. I coupled this app with a scanner app and use it to find better deals online. In this economy, saving money is huge. I appreciate that this app makes it easier!
A11VL05XCA5W5A B00992CF6W 5 1367884800 41 It's amazing to me that you can put a game like Minecraft on a cell phone. It feels like Minecraft as well! The controls are a bit interesting to get used to, but after a few minutes your are mining away.
A11VL05XCA5W5A B0066WJLU6 5 1368921600 26 I love having a flashlight in my hand when I need it. It's perfect for emergency situations when you don't know where to find a light.
A11VM1MKX6PHHW B00AGOGOLE 2 1388361600 22 Not real impressed!  Very disappointing quality.  Didn't do very well in lower lights... needed bright lights and then it looked washed out.
A11VM1MKX6PHHW B00D9CNAOY 4 1390521600 53 I was really enjoying this game until I got to the last competition level... I have not been able to win at that level for over a month now.  The computer has been coming up with words that I've never heard of and the scoring doesn't appear to be accurate all the time!
A11VSNY68E2N6Z B0091REZMW 5 1382140800 67 I have been playing Mystery Manor for about a week now and thoroughly enjoy it. It provides a great distraction for passing time while not being boring or monotonous. Also, the quests keep things interesting and making friends is fairly easy. You don't have to spend any actual money on the game unless you choose to, which is also nice. Overall a fun addition to my collection.
A11VSNY68E2N6Z B0052AZJV8 4 1382659200 31 Clear and concise system for messaging between platforms and sites. Makes it easy to submit status updates quickly and track what is going on in your friend's lives in one location.
A11VSNY68E2N6Z B00HJ30F1U 4 1395187200 20 The gaming interface is mostly the same other than having better graphics as far as I can tell thus far.
A11VSNY68E2N6Z B007SYWFRM 4 1387756800 30 This game is cute, and very similar to Sims with an Ice Age twist. Would be nice if they made it easier to get more acorns without spending cash though.
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B00GI8AMI8 3 1404777600 36 Far too short. The graphics are okay. The game itself is rather easy compared to other games of the same type. For me this was FAOTD and I would not actually pay real money for it.
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B00DJFIMW6 5 1397174400 26 This app is fun though just like most other running games. I do need Facebook friends add me put in the email themetel@Gmail.com to find me
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B006MI4JEM 1 1390867200 43 This game sounded good from the description b it was really easy. Even on the lightning level it was easy to keep the time going. I thought it would be like boggle but it was not. Too bad Amazon does not have boggle.
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B008CJ19HY 1 1390694400 38 All you do is draw a few lines that look like fireworks. You cannot save it so all you can do is watch it repeat itself. Not anywhere close to as cool as I thought it would be.
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B00IEBE7GK 1 1404950400 64 This game was fine, despite a few ghost references, until they had tarot cards in one scene. As a Christian I just can't play something with tarot cards, which is why I gave a one star review. As far as everything else the game was not bad, the difficulty was a little on the hard side but there were hints so it evened out.
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B00HJ30F1U 1 1391040000 28 This app crashed my kindle HDX. I had to hold the power button for like thirty seconds just to turn it off. Otherwise the game was just okay.
A11VUGIQKDHYAZ B006SMEV9K 3 1390867200 54 I have had this problem a couple of times and it was rather frustrating. I went into the settings and changed it so that it saves automatically. Now all I do is tap the back button and so far it saves. I have only done this a few times but it seems to work.
A11VVW7QGMDA64 B007F2EGFQ 5 1333065600 30 fantastically fun I tried it and was pulled into a little fantasy world I wish I could live in.this game is better than most facebook games I just love it.
A11VVW7QGMDA64 B007P6T52G 5 1338681600 28 I app-ciutly love its a rainy weekend afternoon Mindanao game but I can come home after a tough day at work and just relax into my own island
A11VVW7QGMDA64 B009T6IV02 5 1354147200 28 it grabbed me in the tutorial and then it kept my attention. I finished the game in an hour but the next episode looks to be even better
A11VW1KQNI02L3 B0063M22QO 5 1381708800 22 Love to play this game while relaxing..gives me a good eye/brain workout trying to match them up.I never get tired of it!
A11VWV1OKGVD4V B006AZZPCM 4 1371168000 23 great app for watching and downloading videos problem is that their always erorrs during the video so you have to reboot the video
A11VWV1OKGVD4V B006CZ4238 1 1342137600 20 its not worth your money you can barley control the person and horrible graghs shouldn't have been made or bought
A11W56ASJUTBK4 B005KC664W 5 1337904000 24 Works great on kindle. Lot's of levels to choose from. Simple to difficult. Graphics are easy to see and game is easy to navigate.
A11W56ASJUTBK4 B004TI2ZOI 5 1340150400 29 I have found this to be a necessary addition to the Kindle. Large easy to read display makes it easy to do simple math problems whenever the need arises.
A11W56ASJUTBK4 B00AEEZK70 4 1359331200 35 This game is a fast moving game where you match the Color blocks as the fall with the blocks falling faster with more colors the further you get in the game. Very addicting and entertaining.
A11W56ASJUTBK4 B006J2EG6M 3 1356739200 35 The game is fun if you have time on your hands. I was looking for Lexicon and found this one. Not quite aa addictive or challenging as Lexicon but you can still find yourself playing.
A11W6NT5L2E2NY B00HCU7OCI 5 1401494400 32 It gave me 20 dollars and that's the only reason I bought it so yay and thx I don't really like you but you have me 20$ so your my new friend
A11W6NT5L2E2NY B00DJFIMW6 5 1390003200 31 I love this app so much! If you could choose stuff for your minion like:Tall or short, 1 eye or 2, the stuff that personalized the minions in the movies  :D
A11W6NT5L2E2NY B008G0HTUU 4 1388102400 47 I got this app on my iPad last year and I played it in my car and all over the place without using WiFi. Now I got it on my kindle fire and it will not let me use it unless I have wifi. Fix that please
A11W6NT5L2E2NY B00CO6TOZA 5 1391040000 154 I played it for like 20 minutes then crashed it. When I got back one I had to restart. The an hour or so later it crashed again and I had to restart. It's been fine since then. And the campaign screen glitches out sometimes and shows random colors. Well not random but conversed, flipped, twisted, swap up, combine, filtered, and a little more.Other than that it's GREAT. Could use interactive humans though. Like tell them what to do. And a new thing called &amp;#34;Lab&amp;#34; where there's a new tab called &amp;#34;Lab blocks&amp;#34; and in the lab you combine current elements to make new ones. The screen will not tell you what they are till there discovered.Finnaly: more technology. Like turrets and soldier powder for humans. Red team and blue team. Which is a new campaign chapter: WAR. Defend a base from teams. Metal walls, turrets, etc. Good game. no. GREAT. Sand box game
A11W6NT5L2E2NY B00FT8FRO2 4 1389052800 46 My kindle keeps freezing when I turn on the app and run it for a while. Plz fix this, then it would be a nice 4 star game. And make those birds in the tress less freaky! Gah! They scare the check out of me!!! Uuugh!
A11W6NT5L2E2NY B00H7Y9CKG 1 1401494400 67 So I was playing and the smoke started coming out of my kindle and my dragons started dancing with TROLL faces and it played &amp;#34;everybody do the flop&amp;#34; then they fell over and my island turned into kittens and my kindle burst into flames and exploded and sent me to another deminsion for 8 seconds and I woke up in a 1 month coma.Overall: yesterday was april
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00E4MCCF6 3 1382572800 80 these puzzles are okay.I am not very good at puzzles and it takes me awhile to do them but I like it that you can work on it for awhile turn it off and come back and you do not have to start over. I just got this puzzle and I wish the free puzzles would of had a tiger or a cat or dog. maybe when I can afford to buy the next set it will have some animals.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00D3ULE1I 3 1376784000 62 this slot game is ok but you do not win cry often I keep playing I but you run out of coins very fast so tun it gets expensive to play because you have to keep buying coins and I am not made of money.also to buy more coins is $10.00 and up tor q free take that seems a little excessive.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B008878MQQ 4 1390608000 69 I like this game the only thing I did not like was I had this game on my kindle and when it quit working and I bought a new kindle and I had to download my game and I lost all of my credits and had to start over. Otherwise it is a fun gameWith lots of colorful pictures and games to play that are fairly easy to win.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00DBCJLOA 4 1374796800 29 I just got this. game a few minutes ago but so far it seems to be okay I have not won very much but I am just getting started.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00IU61TPQ 5 1399852800 37 I just got this game and I seem to be winning  three fourths of the time. It is a fast paced exciting game and it gives you a lot of different colorful games to choose from.very enjoyable.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00KSOQ66K 4 1405555200 45 I just got this game and so far it has been fun to play . I have not tried all of the games but the graphics are fantastic so far and I seem to be winning fairly often. I recommended every one to try it.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00BTL5YMI 3 1399334400 56 I have downloaded this game twice now and I must be stupid because a lot of the games I can't figure out. But one thing know for sure is you lose most of the time. So you go through your coins fast . I will probably dump this game I can't afford to keep buying credits.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B0081JPTXK 3 1392422400 116 I enjoy this game most of the time. I do not win very often but it is enjoyable fun way to pass the time and relax. It also has a good variety of games to chose from.the only part I do not understand is the bonus games where you get a 1000 credits for each friend and 1000 credits for every day you return and then you spin the wheel and get more credits but when it totals all the credits you do.not get the credits for yo u r friends. So my friend that I  put in I never got the credits for them so I did not offer this game to any more friends.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00H2I9F4U 3 1392681600 45 This game is ok but you are pressured a lot to make bigger bets to get bigger wins which I can not afford to do.so I make small bets and hopefully will win  Even if it's a little.I enjoy playing it to pass the time.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00CB2837W 1 1367625600 31 I am not very smart when it comes to electronic games and I had trouble figuring out how to go on past a certain point t so I dumped the game.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00ELMHHAE 2 1392422400 66 I really liked this game but now it says I have to update the game and when I click on it there is no update button. Tech support says to delete this game and repurchase it but then I lose all my credits and advancements and I do not want to do that. So I guess I just can't play it anymore.was fun while it lasted.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00H343YNQ 5 1390089600 58 I just got this game for free and I thought that it would be like other games and you do not win. very often. But imagine my surprise when I have won almost every time I spin I will keep this game for awhile.and see what happens. But so far it seems to be a lot of fun.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00CNT8KW6 5 1373932800 61 this is a fun game and I actually win on this. game so far. I just started with this app and it seems to be easy to play and win. I do not usually win at these games in real life or on my kindle but so far I have been doing fairly well and it keeps me entertained for awhile.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00IKZX1ZI 4 1395878400 36 I just got this app and it seems to be a lot of fun right now. I am not sure if I am playing the game the right way but I seem to be winning easily.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B004HE5TAG 4 1402012800 20 This game is ok I do not win very often but ,it is great fun trying to hit twenty one.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00GXH3TGG 2 1396137600 37 I used to like playing this game but now it says I have to update it before I can play but it will not let me update.please fix this or I will cancel my game. Thank you.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00975HIYU 5 1389744000 47 I have played this game for the last two years and I do not always win but it is great fun trying to build up points and there are a lot of different game choices to choose from  so you get a lot of chances to win.Julia
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00E0NWJVG 5 1390435200 43 I got this game and at first could not figure out how to play it but it was very easy to learn and you advance very fast. It seems to be a lot of fun and I highly recommended this game to anyone.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00HYL0AAI 3 1394841600 112 This game starts out fairly well and you start to win ok and you think you are doing ok but then you lose it all fast. I like it when you first turn it on and you get to play five free spins on any game and usually you win fairly well. But if your not paying attention the free spins are over and it switches back to the game and it goes to the highestbet and you lose all your credits and have to buy more and I do not know about anybody else but I can not. afford to keep buying credits.I am not sure why I keep this game.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B007TBAQCK 3 1374796800 82 I like playing g this game but it runs very slow and you do not get very many bonus games and you do not win very often. also you do not win very much o bonuses. I also get a lot of emails on my kindle about free coins and games but whenever I try to open them it comes up as game not found so I can never access them. I even triied reloading my game and it did not change.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00HKF00UI 5 1393113600 31 I just got this game and have not figured it all out yet but it seems to be addictive and very fast paced. Hopefully it will be a lot of fun.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00JF8Z1NO 5 1402012800 44 This game is new to me but I seem to be win ing fairly often. The graphics and colors are nice to see. I do not like all of the advertisements but I  can click those off and say no whenever they show them.
A11WE3JT3KNK34 B00AEL7M7E 4 1390262400 23 This game seems to be a lot of fun and it is very easy to figure out and advance to the next round
A11WFT8964841H B00A4O6NMG 3 1390694400 31 I don't like that this is an android/iphone/kindle only game. On my kindle I sometimes have issues with connectivity (per the game, not my device). Otherwise, I find it mildly addicting.
A11WFT8964841H B00FLMU7BY 1 1390176000 21 I downloaded on my Kindle Fire, and there was no sound. Hard to play with no sound. not a good product.
A11WFT8964841H B007D3JV84 3 1398556800 23 freebie app I grabbed because it sounded interesting. personally have no use for it, and after playing with it for awhile, deleted it.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B006PKQQSE 2 1347408000 38 Starting to learn to play.  At one point used all my cards, then a dialogue box comes up but before I can read it the game is gone.  FC is my guess.  Happens every time too.  ASUS Transformer.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B005FNNIAG 5 1326326400 34 I love this game so it gets a high rating, but it's the FAOTD again?  This has to be about 3 times now for this sequel, one was the HD version.  What gives Amazon?
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B005J0VPNC 5 1320796800 69 EDITED AND REVISED REVIEW:  Back in November I did have an issue with this freezing up on startup.  I have since uninstalled and downloaded again and it works fine.This is a fun app with various types of scenes.To the developer:  Thanks again for your reply to my review, I'm just sorry I don't get notified with replies nor do we see them using the App Store.All is well now!
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B007D2XSW0 1 1340323200 82 Nice features so I thought I'd give it a try.  Attempted to open a picture from gallery and a notice comes up, &quot;Woops, there is a bug with Kindle Fire....&quot; then you tap Okay which does nothing.  Um my Asus Transformer isn't using the Kindle OS so don't urge me to contact Amazon.  The problem is the app itself so quit blaming others and fix it.  Fix for more stars.  I would give zero just for the blame game if I could.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B0066T0BTO 1 1360195200 19 Apparently EA doesn't care about updating their software to work with the latest operating system.This game is now useless.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B00CBJMYKM 1 1374624000 27 IAP bad, forced notifications advertising other products.  I don't see how this game ia worth all the trouble.  Paying for a game should remove these shady tactics.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B00HA8WNZ0 4 1400112000 42 This game is simple in playing, but advanced in making you think.  I'm on C now and I keep having trouble.  I found that if you keep trying you eventually get it but am afraid as I progress it'll get much worse.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B004UBTYHU 1 1327190400 44 Not bad on my Evo but on my Asus just get a black screen.  I can hear sound but see nothing.  Went back to game description but it has no warnings against tablet use.Was hoping to see this on the larger screen, oh well.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B004N8R576 2 1313193600 29 Almost always force closes on me, using HTC EVO 3d.\n\nIt does seem like a good time killer though.  I will keep checking for updates and hope for a fix
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B0067R8JNK 4 1374537600 75 Another recycled FAOTD which is good for newer people but unfair to those of us that have been getting these FAOTD.I can't give the app a bad rating for that though so four stars.  The dictionary needs a lot of work.If I remember correct the game is pretty cool, you can even pause it when you need.EDIT:  Seems my review is being deleted, but I see 4 others that reference that this FAOTD is recycled?
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B004R49A4W 5 1397347200 24 Love this resource.  Keep in mind when you download the bird songs and information utilize the SD card.  It takes a lot of space.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B005VTS4EY 4 1331424000 93 This game doesn't have much by way of graphics but I found it to be quite fun and sometimes seemingly too challenging.Some people rated it poorly just because you can't skip levels, I don't see the problem with that.I enjoyed the faces they made as they moved or dropped.  Sometimes some of the puzzles had me baffled, but I simply tried another tactic until I got through it.I rated 4 stars because it seemed to short for me, I would like to see an update with more levels.  Yes I completed the game.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B007V5CF5K 3 1338508800 41 I love the gameplay but am having trouble with frequent crashes to the startup screen.Also on the railway schedule I have input all the times on the clock to no avail, not sure if it's a bug?Using an ASUS Transformer TF101
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B0061S0A64 3 1375315200 18 April 2012 showing by the reviews.This is getting sad now.Amazon are you running out of apps to use?
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B006IY163C 1 1324771200 22 Just another game app trying to get us to buy.  No thanks.  Looks like about 5 to 9 games come with it.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B004RCUJ9E 3 1326240000 42 I have been enjoying this game a lot, but it could use some UI tweaking.What I really don't like though is for some odd reason this runs in the background.  Why?Would like to see more choices for colors and backgrounds though too.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B008S3EJSU 5 1400112000 83 Simply love this game.  It is set in medieval times of course.  There is some "adult" humor but this is one of my favorites.  Probably best played on a tablet.Make sure you have a lot of room, as the download is massive.  I have to hold off on playing again (ran out of room) until my tablet gets updated to KitKat since I cannot move to SD card.  (Stupid Samsung trying to promote their newer Galaxy 10.1 and withholding updates on the original)
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B004X1TJQI 4 1314748800 46 Seems somewhat fun, but lacking.  There is nothing revealing in this game like some say, you see more on morning television.  The theme is a family of hicks down south, deep in the swamps and they protect their land from what appear to be alien monsters.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B00FRM93FE 3 1390089600 34 I did enjoy this game a lot.  Some things seemed too easy but others were difficult to figure out.  It seems clicking everywhere almost always got you your answer.Wish it had been longer though.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B008JJM88Q 4 1397347200 26 Great app and seems to be updated with the latest in books, movies, stories and more.  I have only beat it about 2 times with characters.
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B007BPFIE0 1 1353369600 26 Not to get too involved in this review here, I just didn't like this &#34;game&#34; at all.  It might be fun for some, perhaps little kids?
A11WKHP13EIFP7 B0067Q42BY 1 1378166400 89 The ads are distasteful, something you might expect from a free app but not paid.This is also another recycled FAOTD and while many of you hate that we complain about that keep in mind that this year Amazon has been recycling FAsOTD quite a bit.It is understood that new users are getting the chance to obtain these apps but if this keeps up even you guys will start seeing them recycled and will understand how some of us feel.Amazon must be running out of apps, at least decent ones.
A11WLWA6P1FBKD B009ZKSPDK 4 1360886400 26 i love it its got like speers and preaty cool items i would pit 5 stars but i wish it had something like pistons on it
A11WLWA6P1FBKD B00A3NQNUU 5 1364688000 24 i love it it is so fun it has a awesome story adventure i love it get it get it it is also free
A11WLWA6P1FBKD B00992CF6W 5 1360886400 26 this is the best app you could ever buy it's worth every penny it is the best and also try survivle craft its preaty fun also
A11WPT7E87G571 B00JVZ0DQG 5 1404259200 22 Great game easy to play.. unlimited water no energy limit very user friendly I LOVE It............I highly recommend it..  get the game
A11WPT7E87G571 B00AREIAI8 5 1359936000 55 awesome game very easy to play and funall the fun of playing a horse without all the hard work lolonly thing I don't like is u couldn't choose the Color of ur horse at the beginning your stuck with an ugly horse unless u spend real money to get another one that part is lame
A11WPT7E87G571 B0063IH60K 5 1356652800 21 it is very easy fun to playlove the idea of tapping instead of sliding cardsvery nice game one of my favotites
A11WPT7E87G571 B009KS4XRO 5 1374969600 23 I love this game iplay it every day just wish we got more chips without having to spend real money to get them.
A11WPT7E87G571 B00AMEFZ72 3 1375833600 47 this is a nice game but you need the coins and you get hardly any of them each day.  and I cannot spend real money to buy them.  the game itself is really fun.  its a bit different from the other bingos. see you in the game!!!!!
A11WQMS85EVJFP B00CEBKMN8 4 1392854400 23 Pretty good little game. It's fun just to see how good u can do. Don't let the coins fall off the sides though.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B0060CIG0I 1 1356480000 36 I was looking forward to playing this game, but at the gate, the screen flipped and wouldn't flip back no matter what I tried. So disappointed. I am glad I hadn't paid for full version yet!
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00B4VI8MQ 5 1365811200 25 I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are good and it worked fine on my kindle fire hd.I look forward to more games like this.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00BJ9VBLI 5 1365033600 23 This is one of the more fun games I have played on my kindle fire hd.  The graphics are good and no glitches...
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00DRHY8EW 5 1376179200 25 This is my new favorite game. Challenging without being completely frustrating and the graphics are real good even when you zoom. I would recommend it.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00ADIT8U2 4 1355529600 20 Good puzzle game. Not too hard but good to pass the time. Worth the 99 cents.I would recommend this game.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00AIQP9DE 4 1358121600 29 Interesting story line and good graphics. Not too far in yet, but so far it has run well on my kindle fire hd. I think it's worth paying for.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00ATDOVNK 5 1358726400 28 I really enjoyed the graphics and story line of this game. It also ran without any problems on my kindle fire hd. I look forward to the sequel.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00BUONELM 5 1366329600 47 I play a lot of these games and this is a lot of game for the money. Good puzzles and ho. Not too much of either so you don't get bored doing the same thing over and over..I look forward to more of these!  Good job MumboJumbo
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00DWJBOI8 5 1375747200 25 I played on the kindle hd and had no issues. Interesting and worth playing more than once.The scenes were nice and I would recommend it.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B0097GVJWQ 4 1354924800 21 This game is loads if fun! I definitely recommend it!Just challenging enough to keep you busy for a day or two.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00C5HW022 5 1365465600 22 I really enjoyed this game. I think it's my new favorite!  There were no glitches and the story line was real interesting.
A11WQTCHHGCGG B00C71OUJC 5 1365724800 25 I thought the game was freezing on the west wing but you have to hit on the dialogue. So I changed my review.  Great game!
A11WRC0V65NWPP B004SVMNXY 1 1333670400 37 this game doesn't have any fun to it. I mean I got bored in just a second. They also need to make the levels shorter. I would not recomemd this game to anyone who likes REAL fun.
A11WRC0V65NWPP B007JYI4SU 1 1351296000 23 This was offal. Every time I did it it said I was gleeful and happy Wich was not true. This was a ripoff.
A11WRC0V65NWPP B006U52MQY 2 1327536000 24 this game is dreadful. all you have to do is make the things jump and catch the potatoes. and it makes a annoying sound.
A11WRPN0KGHKLQ B00DUGCLY4 4 1394409600 23 .It's a cool app. If you don't know what emojis are its fine . Some are hard. It has some really cool emojis
A11WRPN0KGHKLQ B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393113600 20 I love this game it s the best way better then flappy Bird it's so cool I love it  woun
A11WRPN0KGHKLQ B00AGOGOLE 5 1384128000 20 AwesomeIt is an amazing product, I got it for free and I love it!!!!!!!!!! It has awesome features and functionality
A11WTZMFI65BOA B00BLS2U6M 3 1381622400 30 I downloaded this game. Waited two days.. it never loaded.It looks amazing I am waiting for it to load. I would give two stars if it didn't have great graphics.
A11WTZMFI65BOA B00CZDSK7K 4 1369699200 63 Great game alot better than the first. I play the first on my computer. My only problem is you have to buy furniture and renovate so money is really tight. It's hard because none of my people have beds because I can't afford it. Tho I do like how you can buy coins. And their really cheap. So I would recommend this game
A11WTZMFI65BOA B00CO6TOZA 5 1381622400 35 Five stars for the sandbox. My friend has it on her iPod and I have been waiting for it to come out on kindle clearly! This app is amazing totally and completely recommended this app.
A11WWFXJ4R2961 B009HKL4B8 5 1361232000 23 Sims is amazing and fun. I always play it. I hope people who don't have Sims free play get it because it's fun.
A11WWFXJ4R2961 B00D1WA26Q 5 1389398400 20 Get it. It's so fun. U can talk to her without a microphone. I've played it on Google play. PLEASE!
A11WWFXJ4R2961 B00DCQXHGS 4 1372723200 20 It's okay but I want all the celebrities. Please fix this if u can. XOXO. Thanks. Love y'all. Bye-bye. ;D
A11WYLM1S9NOZM B00702PZME 5 1393286400 23 I love that's it's a quick little game and not timed.  Gets more difficult as you move forward but simple and easy to.play
A11WYLM1S9NOZM B00E0NVX4U 5 1397001600 37 So much fun. More than just hidden objects. The mini games break up what could be a monotonous game. Also love spending 'money' to fix up the store. It is worth spending $1.99 to get full game
A11WYLM1S9NOZM B00HHBXYGM 4 1395705600 21 It's fun. Challenging and pretty and free! E everyone should try it it's a cool mat h 3 game. Get it
A11WYLM1S9NOZM B00J4YTRP2 3 1397520000 106 After giving a 5-star review to the first version, purchasing the full version. and being g disappointed. I hesitate to give a glowing g review to this version.  I Loved the first Antique Road Trip but as soon. As I paid $1.99 for the full version I was disappointed because nothing changed. The mini games were the same.  The shop was the same with nothing new to buy.  Even the 'new' locations were had the same items with just a slightly different way to play.Road Trip 2 is fun and more challenging but after my experience with #1 I will not waste my money on Homecoming
A11WZEEOJPJ4QD B00E5GJ7QS 5 1404950400 6 I Love this game.  Very addicting!
A11X0RF20MIB1D B006DU97XC 5 1357603200 67 I needed an app for our local TV listings. This is the best one that I have found. I can put in just the channels that we receive and don't have to scroll through those that we don't get. also I can scroll through several days to see what is coming on. It has when they are new shows and when they are not.. Well worth downloading.
A11X0RF20MIB1D B00BMK357W 2 1387756800 40 I don't care for this game at all.  I reached a point and because I didn't pop all the fruit they want me to pay for more chances. I do not  want to have to pay to play any games.
A11X0RF20MIB1D B006VFNUEG 2 1345852800 29 The weather part is great but I can't get any local news as they haven't had anyone take it over for a long time. I am disappointed in this.
A11X0RF20MIB1D B004SYIA1U 4 1360800000 33 So far this has been good. I can listen to the old time radio programs. I used to have XM radio but it got too expensive. With this I can listen for free.
A11X1UKW5P84QA B008A07U0U 2 1353888000 43 i think this app is ok but in order to get pass the first 11 levels you need to buy the full version and it is a super easy game or as others would say not worth the time to download or buy.
A11X1UKW5P84QA B00AREIAI8 3 1358899200 22 I think it is made for younger kids but if you are a kid how loves horses than this a game for.
A11X1UKW5P84QA B00BMH4GQE 3 1364342400 28 I think that this is the same as the other one I have but with a different name so I don't like when people do that with apps.
A11X1UKW5P84QA B008YRVW0I 3 1353888000 22 this is an ok game because i bet this game i one days worth and so the levels dont get any harded
A11X1UKW5P84QA B00BG3ID0Y 3 1364342400 30 its better that all of the ones I can get for the kindle fire. I don't like this game I will sit here for hours when I could be outside.
A11X1UKW5P84QA B00846GKTW 3 1343088000 36 the game has a theme you have to go with instead of the other games oils this were you just do free style and this game you can get help ans hints if you need them
A11X1UKW5P84QA B005ZFOOE8 3 1353888000 20 i got this app because i have pandora and i thought it was different then that. i like pandora better
A11X1UKW5P84QA B008AYOLB2 4 1353888000 54 i like this game because i like/know a lot of songs but i some times forget what the name of them are and when i hear a song i know i know what the words are but i dont know the names and if you get the title right it tells what they are.
A11X4CC82BYTQE B00ATDOVNK 5 1365033600 26 Excellent Graphics!! I Love This Game!!! I Will Be Looking Forward To More Games Like This One. All The Mini Puzzles Are So Much Fun.Love Them

A11X4CC82BYTQE B00B4VI8MQ 5 1362528000 28 Graphics are fantastic!! The Game is awesome.would recommend. I like the hog games.some of the items are hard to find,but all in all the game is really great!!
A11X4N0UK6CBBR B00E8KLWB4 5 1390089600 20 There are a lot of steps to keep you busy. The o t her hidden object games were more juvenile.
A11X4N0UK6CBBR B00DHKKN6Q 4 1402272000 21 This is challenging to get all the points you need to unlock the next level. My family loves playing this game.
A11X4N0UK6CBBR B0091REZMW 4 1393200000 28 Very addictive and exciting. Many levels and rooms to explore children of all ages will enjoy. This one is exiting as the others from G5 I have played.
A11X5TN04XR5QW B004T2QZL8 5 1332201600 26 this game rrrrrrroooooooocccccccckkkkkkkksssssssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love it but make sure to put it on kid mode it you don't wont your kid seeing the word sex or vodka.
A11X5TN04XR5QW B007VCVCAM 2 1335571200 28 I cant get past the stupid 2nd level!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is lame and should make Garfield a bit better at defending the kitchen. it is so frustrating. &lt;3 Peyton
A11X5TN04XR5QW B006N1K1AE 5 1333929600 22 super fun. you should try to write your name in cursive and then decorate it to make it look like an insect
A11X5TN04XR5QW B005HSL626 1 1329264000 30 this game was fun until I played one game of arcade mode and now it is frozen and won't let me play it anymore. so it was kind of disappointing.
A11X6TXR64WXFO B009GMD1NQ 2 1389052800 20 it just run and i played it in a few hours the my kindle said that there was an error.
A11X6TXR64WXFO B00BWBHIUG 2 1389052800 20 you can only play it with an internet connection. it is a fun game only if it has a signal.
A11X6TXR64WXFO B00E9A656K 5 1389052800 24 it is a drag race. however, at the middle of my driving carrier in this game. error occurred. its not new to free games...
A11X8GNDJV8IDC B00CZY1ZV2 1 1372204800 19 There is no point to this game. No goal to achieve and not even fun.DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
A11X8GNDJV8IDC B00992CF6W 5 1372204800 23 Just great.  My son loves this game it keeps him entertained for hours =) Plus he has to use his brain to play!
A11X9JEAAKHZ04 B00B2V66VS 5 1389398400 24 I loved the first version of this game but the second version is 10 times better according to me,but this is just my opinion.
A11X9JEAAKHZ04 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392768000 22 It is harder than original but I think it is a good challenge for the entire family.You need to get this game
A11X9JEAAKHZ04 B008OD6QYE 5 1349568000 21 This game is very very awesome I love it I have games. that I like a very much more tan so.
A11X9JEAAKHZ04 B0054JZC6E 5 1336953600 28 this game is the awesomest game in the history of games and I don't know what I would do without the awesomest game in the history of games
A11X9JEAAKHZ04 B008R5RGAC 5 1370476800 20 I am just glad that I can now not have to worry about any viruses thanks to Norton mobile security
A11X9JEAAKHZ04 B00A7HP4C0 5 1355184000 47 5 g. g gd g g g. bb h vg c f fr d f. b h r t g j f a.  c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
A11XBTHUZ0ISAM B00FAI2IUM 4 1404086400 35 Great game. With the real cars and tracks, but it is hard to earn money. I had that problem right away. It is better that asphalt 8 in graphics and reality but not with money.
A11XD6YP7V7W3J B007Z4AKQI 4 1336176000 67 I love this game because I could never hunt in real life. It is easier killing a virtual deer than a real one. My problem is if you run out of energy, you must wait an hour until it's refilled. If you don't want to do this it forces you to buy energy with your real money. This is true with most games by Glu Mobile Inc.
A11XD6YP7V7W3J B004ZALKMI 1 1327795200 58 If I could I would rate this app negative 19 stars.Whenever I tried to record my voice it said &quot;unable to record&quot;,or something like that.I suggest not getting it at all.If you already have it uninstall it immediately.It is not a talking hairy ball.If you want something that moves it's eyes around then this is perfect for you.
A11XFI2O6D2JZF B005HFNA4Q 5 1330560000 25 This has always put me in a good mood whenever I needed it. this keeps my head held up high no matter what, great app!!!
A11XFI2O6D2JZF B007JPG04E 5 1331942400 23 This game is the bomb!!! Great graphics, gets harder each time. Everyone who like shooting games should get this game, you'll love it!!!
A11XFI2O6D2JZF B0080K98U0 5 1336176000 23 This game is game is extremely epic. I do not care what others think because this game is great and free. Everybody wins!!!
A11XFI2O6D2JZF B0080IOHLW 5 1337472000 26 This game is pretty exciting, I am happy I got this game it never gets old like most games. People needs to make games like this.
A11XFI2O6D2JZF B006ICEDIO 5 1331596800 22 I recomend this to everyone who want to play an addicting game. This game is great and trust it will never old.
A11XFQPZ5ZN7ZV B0055SWM08 4 1386547200 23 Keeps you on your toes. Lots of levels. Still trying to figure some of the moves out but so far it's been fun.
A11XFQPZ5ZN7ZV B00HHBXYGM 5 1392595200 32 I'm addicted to this game. There are so many levels it never get old. If you run out of coins just start from the beginning to collect more. Have fun and enjoy!!
A11XFQPZ5ZN7ZV B00GCI69D6 4 1399248000 27 Fairly easy to figure out, just make sure you are not in landscape mode. I do wish it was more detailed where we a having bad weather.
A11XK7OX2IRSRL B00DZ22QNO 5 1382227200 26 Kinda hard but cool game . Love you chucky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best killer ever!!! Get this game.look for cheats. Super awesome. And you get 15 coins for review
A11XK7OX2IRSRL B00AE9UYJ4 5 1367107200 19 This game is awesome!!!!!  Best slender game ever!!!!!One time I was playing then slender man came out of nowhere!!!!!!
A11XK7OX2IRSRL B00INC0ENU 5 1403740800 25 This is one of the best games I ever played! One problem, it should be easier to get gems. Over all, it's a great game.
A11XK7OX2IRSRL B00E3OUQ5S 5 1381881600 23 This game is awesome! But there should be a way to earn money faster. But anyway great game. P.S the guns are cool!!!!!!
A11XMV2CM1T593 B007NACZPI 5 1332633600 38 Cute game; fun to play. It is similar to other games I play where you add buildings, jobs, goods, and people. Got as fgotd but would have paid the 99 cents for it had I known about it.
A11XMV2CM1T593 B006OCM0G0 5 1330128000 65 This and Bakery Story are my two favorite games; I was so happy to see that Amazon finally has them available. I have been playing this for several months on my Droid and now will start over on the Kindle with a larger view. Would like to transfer the account from my phone, but their website seems to only have transfer for the Apple products.
A11XMV2CM1T593 B006PH7WBM 5 1330128000 76 I've been playing this on my Droid for several months, along with Restaurant Story, Bakery Story, and Farm Story. I like all the games and am glad to see them on Amazon for my Kindle Fire; I like the larger screen size. This one is fun; I'm probably not exactly the target audience in my 40's, but I enjoy unwinding at the end of the day by ordering some new clothes for the next morning. :)
A11XP4GZYX3GQE B00B2W289G 5 1389657600 31 I have had it on my laptop for two years and play it a lot. The hidden object games are always different and you can skip puzzles if you get stuck.
A11XPMMGH475P9 B00885RFRK 4 1369094400 43 its actually a really cool game... I mean I'm not big on hunting but its soo much fun at times but it dose Suck when you get stuck somewhere because you cause be there for hours... but overall its worth at least trying
A11XX51PJ10VXF B00F54F1G4 5 1389398400 36 I saw a review saying stay away on kindle but I loved it if u kno your left from right controls are simple and easy great graphics all round great get it I highly recommend it
A11XX51PJ10VXF B00A8ECU24 5 1360454400 23 freakin awsome it takes real cash to get most things needing gems but idc it kicks butt u need to get this app
A11XX51PJ10VXF B005ZFOOE8 1 1364860800 25 worst radio app ever. Pandora is better. I'm never useing this. don't bother big waste of time. I was hopeing it would be great radio.
A11Y0MBIREXH1I B004MC8CA2 5 1343520000 59 There are a lot of different versions of the Bible available, many off line.  The reading plans offer many chioces as well. I like the fact that the app remembers where you left off. Navagation is easy in the Bible and between the versions of the Bible. I have found this program a convient supplement to our home study.
A11Y0MBIREXH1I B00AR1AUAW 4 1359417600 26 With game you get to give your brain a workout.  It should increase your flexability as you make connections. and sometimes have to find alternate pairings.
A11Y0MBIREXH1I B00702PZME 5 1352764800 26 This starts out easy and then makes you think. some matches come quick, others take a bit more work. A wonderful way tokeep your brain fit.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B004DLPXAO 3 1370044800 37 I was informed it's for PCs and other devices such as phones, and I didn't need this option. So this review is neutral, and maybe useful with those uses in the future, if I ever need it.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B004RDFDEO 5 1372032000 173 I played checkers along with a lot of other people growing up. This game has different levels, and you can use the options of board appearance, levels, or one to two people. The game shows moves you should have made, and challenges you with difficulty on higher levels. How much it challenges you depends on how good a board player you are in checkers. The best things in life are free, and this game must be a small showcase for that point. Free is good! If a maker of an app makes good game or helpful apps people might look for their brands upon selecting or buying. My review reflects no problem with the adds,, as they don't interfere with the game. I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire HD and I am enjoying it. Let's hope this app and A1 keep making good apps for devices, if they be a  phone, tablet or PC. It makes the passing time flow easily, when waiting for a reason to relax and enjoy a game.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B00850NK6I 5 1370044800 139 I have to obtain books from the library as well as private sources like Amazon and others. I love to read, and so far I am getting slowly get educated to the wider scope of the Kindle's power of getting resources. (ebooks and audio books)  It's worked fine for me, and I have learned of the key points of getting books and the use of the Console. Some tools have issues and there are some problems of their use. I didn't have a problem, once I explored some information on the way it all works out. I suggest further reading of some of the manuals to fully understand the Kindle Fire, and the tips to make it a fun device. Knowledge is power and one needs that to make all the tools work for you. It did for me.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B00CX5IXFY 5 1371427200 223 A lot of games by A1 Factory like Spades and Gin Rummy assume you know how to play the game so rules are non-existent. I did wonder how the scoring occurred in their Gin Rummy on a few games, but I will hold up on rating until I see how it goes. I see others wondered that point too. Solitaire here has no evading ads that spoil or distract from just getting in there and playing the game. You can change the backs of the cards, backgrounds and a button if you are left-handed. I noticed other option on there in the settings, so it's great they put some flexibility into the game for different player needs.  So the game has ok options and it played fine when I was idle waiting on someone or an appointment killing time. As pass-time games go, it's easy enough to get in there and play. It seems A1 set this game similar to their other apps. I found no difficulties with the game, but will wait over time to see how this pans out. I can always remove it. I always welcome others to make more assessments, so we select the rate the best game. There is no final ruling until we all agree it's one of the best solitaire games of it's type or not....
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B005OQJG0K 4 1376870400 223 I had a lot of time to think whether this app was functioning, and its ease of use worked fine. This is an utility app, where it's another method of shutting down the connectivity of the Kindle with WiFi. It seems to work fine on my relatively short time of ownership. I haven't experienced any problems, and it has a power manager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming. I got the app for the idea, that it would assist my wrap up, when shutting down the Kindle. It does help upon leaving and also conserving the battery. I can go quickly, after completing my time using the Kindle in any one place. I like having to leave the house and use the Kindle at various places or having to be waiting at an appointment or at any place that has WiFi. One example would be a fast food location to sip a coffee or get a bite to eat. I believe for me the Kindle is a fun device, and I use it for music, game playing, card playing like Solitaire, and book reading. An app like this makes it easier to check if WiFi is present or turn it off when I have to go. I found the price of nothing to make it a value-added device too.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B00DPGB68G 4 1376265600 124 A person has four choices of the game in this app with Klondike, Spider, Free Cell and Fourty Thieves to play with big cards, with small or large images. Display time, scoring mode, and auto movement of the cards, (always, after fling, or never) and you can select one or three cards at a time. The scoring mode can be normal or vegas scoring. Spider Solitaire can have 1, 2, and 4 suits. I like different games to play, and the non-price was reasonable for acquiring this app game. I would rated it higher, if the screen would have been optional of portrait or landscape and the beginning had an easier access to the game, without having an easier developer's first page dismissal issue.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B00AQ398AY 4 1371168000 204 I checked with a person who works in a college library, and also has a Kindle Fire. I asked her if she had any recomendations for security and antivirus apps to use on my Kindle Fire HD. She suggested Lookout Security & Antivirus was her choice. She mentioned she had it on her Kindle for over a year and had no problems. I weighed her suggestion, but tried AVG first. It wasn't compatible with my Kindle device. I tried to be different based on another reviewers comments, that AVG was a good antivirus app, but he might have had a device that worked with it. So when picking apps or anything else to download, compatibility is key to at least be a good marriage between the product and the device. Whether it be an iPhone, Tablet, or any newer mobile device that the market creates. I used someone elses experience and knowledge based over a year. I finally took her suggestion, and I hope it works out for me too. Reviews don't always help, if people don't explain all the pitfalls learned through trial or error for the selections. I hope I helped the next person who wonders where to turn for a choice....
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B004K4RY9M 4 1371513600 203 I wanted a word search game to pass the time, and this one along with the upgrade one are in my possession on Kindle Fire Hd. I don't worry about how challenging these games are because I am killing time. I use the first letter and search anyway, so no matter how hard the word is or what theme the board has I can find it on word search. If one is good in grammar, word search is good for the eyes and mind to keep focused on looking for words. It helps for the young and for the older users. It's like card games. Keeps the mind active and clicking with mental challenges. I hope the focus on word search is not to be so picky, but appreciative, that you have your eye sight and your mind. Without those important aspects in life you have less reason to exist in this world. You notice more how relevant this is to your family and friends along with you can enjoy the fine reason to live. One needs to take in life through those challenges. Brain game show that is currently running on tv helps illustrate this point, and I really like that show.....
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B004EBZX6W 4 1374019200 147 I read the issues of freezing and people downloading it, and then having to remove it for different reasons. I give an app of this type time to see what it can do for finding those access points known as hot spots. I can follow the readings ok, but I too wish it had a free adds version available. Maybe that was going to be for this offering of an WiFi analyzer from this company. Test and use over time will tell, if this app is worth keeping on the Kindle Fire HD Tablet. I will give it a try, and I will keep searching for others to have a possible back up of the same type app available for my Kindle Fire HD. I think the multitude of resources like the guide books and manuals help one know what is true or works true to use.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B005WVJGT8 5 1372032000 98 I refreshed my memory on playing this free Hearts game through the handy test drive, so I could get the hang of it. I was able to  jump right into Hearts. I relearned soon after how to  play, and I enjoyed the pass the time game with no major difficulties. It takes some time to adjust to any app game that has it own set up. The settings make the game more challenging, if you want it to be. No other issues I could complain about, so I am glad I added it to my app card games.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B007ZGO7EM 4 1372377600 68 A basic calcualtor, which is all I need on the Kindle Fire HD. I don't need a scientific one or one with other extra functions. I just need a type calculator to assist my decisions or make do for some quick handy math calcuations. It works ok for me, and I will judge over time, if a better one is noticed or this one has some unknown issues.
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B007NZV2HK 1 1371168000 59 I don't like spam, ads, and other interruptions when playing a game after clicking on an app. I find this the case even though the word search could be fun. The colors over the words (?) flow over each other some time when playing the game. I think I will pass on the deluxe version costing more than free.....
A11Y2VAR3AWSPX B004GMJKTK 1 1372896000 39 If I have to stop and start over because it freezes up this game doesn't work for me. I like to keep going and this app needs some updates or alterations to make it a smooth game to play.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00AAX68HG 5 1358294400 23 in this puzzle you need to merge  the blobs just right to end on top of all three stars for a perfect score.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008O661PK 4 1347494400 44 this game is a lot of work trying to remember where you need to return to overall its a fun game but finding the item to open the door then remembering where that door is can be tricky exspecially upon returning from a break.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0089Z3D02 5 1340582400 55 this game is old school fun there is only six games the challenge is to be perfect not so easy.  I perticularly liked the bubble pop where try to free the prizes I couldn't put it down.  even if I get a perfect I have to try again (maybe I'll get a better score) .
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008N8IV2U 2 1344124800 21 I like puzzle games but without some guidance these games can seem impossible I took it of at level 3 .
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008B88LEU 5 1346198400 36 I really enjoy a game where you need to think ahead in this game you place bushes and things that upgrade if three touch.  not to hard but definitly not easy if you play it right.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B004SJ3BCI 3 1340582400 25 all Ive heard is this is so cool.  challenging, maybe,  but it couldn't hold my interest .  I've already took it off my kindle fire.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008JGSM6G 5 1342483200 22 not the most challenging game but fun anyway just have to connect the dots.  but a little harder than you might think.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B005KC664W 3 1337817600 23 I am a decent player but I found this one to be to much work took the fun out of it for me.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0091REZMW 3 1352505600 27 this game is enjoyable but to unlock a room cost diamonds and to keep playing it could cost a fortune because it wants real money to replenish.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0055SWM08 5 1334016000 24 I put this on the fire its a thinker but not hard. I enjoy trying to match the perfect score. Not so easy then.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008FRA5LY 4 1342742400 22 I really enjoyed this even have my friends downloading it. But wow my brain knows its seen it but can't name it.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B005NJ2K6U 3 1342742400 26 This game is ok I bought it trying to up grade a freebee but itPlayed a little different . Just didn't enjoy it as much .
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B009RC8UFO 3 1351382400 60 this is not a hidden object more of a mind game these games are alright but when you put it away then try again in a few days it can be a bit coufising. it downloaded the whole game but one chapter in and I had to pay 499 and then.  found out. what it wad like not real impressed.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0058VW36U 5 1340582400 24 this game lets you feed the critter by cutting the rope at just the right time. it can get very challenging. can be additive.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008TY8PKG 5 1346198400 21 this game plays like where's my water only you can freeze the water then melt it to get your timing right.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00BGC5UAG 3 1362096000 32 this was fun until I got stuck then to get farther they want to sell me more I down loaded a different one they play the same but you can earn help.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00ATDOVNK 5 1359158400 59 this is a good puzzle type game gives lots of hints and has mini games. people keep complaining about the price for 2.99 its a bargain I have paid alot more for DS games and you don't get a free trial. I just wish they could condense the file some.  it takes up almost a third of the KF.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008R9OIUO 3 1346198400 25 this is a regular hidden object .  it plays well but you don't. get much for free. there are others out there for free .
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00BC4I19U 3 1363478400 22 would probably would give it more stars but forced to give a rating after two minutes.  reminds me of the Waldo game.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00881VLCE 4 1354924800 26 this was what I expected a bunch of jigsaw puzzles with various difficulty. l would give it five stars but the pictures could be funner .
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008FF8PT0 5 1341705600 22 nice app for kindle fire enough of a challenge without being to hard very large file for things with small memory though
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008AMNF3Y 4 1341360000 22 this game takes a lot of trial and error to get the right sequence.  but it is entertaining if you have patients.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B005MSJ3DK 5 1348272000 23 This game has some hard things to find but not so hard it can't be done.  Overall worth the few minutes to play.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B008L3T37O 4 1355702400 22 this is a typical hidden object.  not to hard. but still a challenge. I did not stop until it was totally completed.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006R8GK2Q 4 1335744000 37 Regular search and find.  Good directions.  Sometimes the objects are unclear as in look for paper and my last item turned out to be a pen.  Really at least let a person know its a relative search.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0084DYNGC 3 1339977600 43 put this on my fire the pop up to buy it was very annoying and the screen would zoom in and out when trying to scroll and could not see the hint pop up finally. just took it off after two different sitting
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007D21OC6 5 1332374400 25 this was a great game for the kindle fire.  I have played others like this it was nice to have different goals for a change.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006JPS1OM 4 1326585600 26 nice little search and find .  I found it not to difficult yet challenging enough. Some are way to challenging.I like to be entertained not frustrated.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0074OZ29O 5 1337644800 22 plays like angry birds you collect stars instead of knocking things down bouncing the bunny off of different size balls you create
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0073LHCCS 2 1342742400 22 I don't Remember this game I've already dumped it off my device so I can't even recheck it. I hope thisHelps you.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007NZV2HK 2 1337817600 27 this has weird words and the pretty colors makes it hard to see the letters to reuse. not recommending it. there are better free ones out there.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0076POKVC 4 1331510400 22 I liked the way this game changes . Good variety of searching and thinking a little wordy though. Still worth the money.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007KQ6XYY 5 1337385600 22 this game is very addicting had lots of fun with it.  would reccomend it to anyone that likes to sit and play.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0080H2TFE 5 1369526400 28 whatever the number is that's how many have to touch.  works sort of like collapse games. you can slide them together to create new ones. makes it interesting.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007XF3WFA 5 1337040000 32 this app was intertaining. I like the way if your wrong it just wont take it. that way you cant really get stuck. it was fun to try and pair things up.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007HBA70S 5 1338595200 38 this was a nice blend of hidden objects and jewel gamesI wish I could enlarge the screen on the hidden objects.but I still was able to enjoy it.  I would definitely recommend this one for the kindle fire.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007CMROQW 5 1342742400 21 This has been entertaining. I have had to really think it through. Sometimes you don't  need all the props your given.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007XFC648 3 1344729600 45 I've have played others like this they are staged so I can usually clear the stage this does not seem to be set for success. it is still fun and worth playing but I agree it should have a shuffle to help keep you going.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0064TVQ5E 4 1327795200 26 I have played a lot of these this one has proven to be one of the more Difficult than the others but nice for a change.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006OBWGHO 5 1340582400 24 in this game you dig paths for the water to reach the pipes. even if the path is right the angle might not be.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006PHD0RW 4 1338681600 32 this is a puzzle fitting game where you need to learn what will rest on top of each other.  fun game got very challenging.  but the control of things could be better.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0067Q4RCI 4 1324857600 29 I enjoy this game but find it a tad frustrating when the object doesn't obey.  And some objects cant be found until you move on to the next part.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006JNH7YY 4 1329004800 22 worth playing but for some reason I had to restart several times but it did change up enough that it was okay.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00CJ8P82Q 4 1367971200 20 this is a shoot and match 3 if the marble goes where you point but it is a nice variation.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007JM4CWY 4 1337731200 24 challenging works well on the fire but I agree the squares are hard to pin point alot of correcting but still worth the effort.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00846F1YW 5 1360627200 26 so far it plays well hasn't froze but haven't made level 13 yet I like these hidden object with other puzzles thrown in they are entertaining.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007FJFDXS 3 1356652800 26 while this app was a nice change I did not like it when the cube would barely roll then the same touch would send it flying
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00CWY76CC 4 1371600000 25 this game is good but I can see the frustration as you go along knowing what needs to be done but missing the one step.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B0085VR7WU 5 1340582400 43 this game works well on my kindle fire in this game you mostly have to roll a 1 or 5 to keep going seems odd though to bet 25 and lose 50.  and they push to play online but you don't have to.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006D1ONE4 5 1337385600 33 this game is one of those games where every thing has to be just so you can play the same thought over and it may finally work if an arc is just so.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B006ZE9Q5A 5 1346198400 26 I down loaded the free one and enjoyed it enough to pay for the rest of it played it though twice before sending it to cloud.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B00846FBEM 3 1342742400 20 This was just ok but a lot of guessing played the freebee for a while but removed. It rather soon.
A11Y3HCXCDGT6K B007VT07QU 3 1339718400 42 I was mildly entertained then it went up a level and I was supposed to buy it.  hadn't played it more than half an hour and all I really did was pick up things. didn't think I liked it enough to buy.
A11Y6XO33EXLQH B00D9SC4TA 5 1372636800 29 omg I love this game it is so fun and alwsome I cant what for my prom night I hope its alsomes and cool and I get a date.

A11Y7PNOYVET2E B008Y2FRFO 3 1348272000 32 why do I have to buy coins that's so messed up fun but too long of a wait for more coins I hate game that want you to buy stuff its bs
A11Y7PNOYVET2E B0064X7B4A 2 1337385600 59 stupid video ad's are pissing me off.I don't mind the picture ad's but the video ones crash the program.when I first got WWF it was fine on my gfs ipod there are no video ad's so why are they on my kindle?it's not like I am gonna buy a car cause I saw it on my game soooo lame.
A11Y7PNOYVET2E B008XAKC98 5 1346371200 41 you people are nuts. this is awesome and Free it has the 3 stooges Omg awesome if its slow its your Internet not the app. its free free movies it wont netflicks but netflicks aint free lol ok get it now!

A11Y7PNOYVET2E B00A3E2BVE 1 1362096000 30 worse price of crap facebook game why load this when you can go online and play it to many ads. just junk not worth 5 cents if you ask me.
A11Y7PNOYVET2E B0071QIN00 4 1328918400 28 pretty awesome love the roads that are ummmmm like where the hell is that lol but all in all still cool worth at least a cuple of bills
A11Y7PNOYVET2E B00AA0TOG6 3 1355875200 54 if you own a kindle fire the game does not fit the screen the pencil it hard to reach .. though it's cute it makes it hard to play the game so that being the case the game is useless .. I don't know if its the same on any other brand of pad
A11Y8IQNVONVK5 B00IEBE7GK 5 1404691200 22 The first one was great and this one is even better! Well worth the money! I can't wait for the next one!!
A11Y8IQNVONVK5 B00B03IY90 5 1372636800 51 The graphics are great, the puzzles within puzzles. Many times one search and/or puzzle needs to be completed to finish another search before you get to what you are looking for. Many of the items are very well hidden. The best hidden object/puzzle game I've played yet! I'm enjoying every moment!
A11YBECDQ7V0P5 B006D1ONE4 1 1328486400 94 This app was a free amazon paid app around Christmas 2011. At the time it had a Christmas theme. It STILL has the Christmas, UNLESS you buy the latest posted version. Currently this app is at version 1.3.6 in the Android Market. Here it is at 1.3.1. It is NOT worth buying apps from the Amazon Market when developers could careless about updating them at the same time the developers update their apps on the Android Market. BUYER BEWARE... BUY all your apps from the Android Market if you want them up to date.
A11YBECDQ7V0P5 B0058VW36U 1 1335484800 32 This app is now at version 1.4. Why isn't on top of updating their apps ? The Google Play market is the best way to go to keep your apps current !
A11YC6T0RONJFH B00E3WJRIM 4 1377388800 50 This game is great. I love trying to guess the phrases and beating my opponents. It would be better with less adds and its glitches a lot saying it has to light up the spinner. It gets really annoying. It would also be nice to just play against the computer.
A11YC6T0RONJFH B00DRHY8EW 4 1377302400 33 Really like this one. Keeps you hooked and looking for something out of the ordinary. Lots of secrets to be uncovered as well. Only problem is the game freezes from time to time.
A11YC6T0RONJFH B009UWL580 5 1363132800 43 Love being able to sit back and free my mind with this game. No stress involved besides running out of grabs...or when the game has a glitch and you have to go from level 87 back to 1...other than that lots of fun!
A11YC6T0RONJFH B00A4KVFLY 4 1358294400 21 Fun game but some answers are not realistic and the fast money round doesn't reveal the top answers in the end.
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B00AA87JGU 4 1375228800 24 I think that this game is fun. not too hard and not too easy. I don't like the buying part but its still cool
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B007MPJQ38 4 1334448000 29 this was a really good game. I wish it was longer but all in all I enjoyed playing it. I cant wait to find another one just like it.
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B00EBE8MUG 4 1380585600 26 I just downloaded this game and it seems fun sofar. the only resin that I'm reviewing after only 4 levels is for the 100 free coins.
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B00AQ8S0F8 5 1359158400 20 I absolutely love this game! it has some challenging stages when u wanna get all of the ducks and extras.
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B00G357N92 5 1391040000 24 I don't normally play this type of game but this one is fun to play so far. I'm keeping up pretty good I think
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B00702PZME 4 1331424000 20 this is a very addictive game. fun to play and works your brain. if u haven't tried it you should.
A11YCS0T9CYEY2 B007PTJOV0 5 1334188800 28 I think this game is fun. as a kid growing up playing super Mario brothers which is addictive I was glad to find this game on my kindle.
A11YEMVCH2N9XX B005HSL626 4 1367280000 27 This game is fun for all ages and I like that there are different games you can play under fruit Ninja.  My son also loves this game.
A11YEMVCH2N9XX B006OBWGHO 4 1359158400 22 This game is really fun. I enjoy the differences on each level and the progress and tips you learn going from 1-10'
A11YEMVCH2N9XX B00AAIHGA4 4 1360800000 25 This app is fun and as far as I can tell exactly like one you would play on computer, reminiscent of the old fun games.
A11YEMVCH2N9XX B00B2V66VS 4 1359417600 35 This version is so much better than the first. Better classes, coins, everything. I am really enjoying it. I hope they make a TEMPLE RUN three.  This is my number one favorite game to play.
A11YEMVCH2N9XX B009PCBEPE 5 1360800000 37 There are lots of levels included in the free version and some are difficult. Its fun because you have to figure out what's required and be creative enough to figure out how to get passed various levels.
A11YF2VHP2N1IA B009WJNXAE 1 1384819200 22 it will not load. it loaded one time and it kept turning upside down.. i could not play it. i deleted it.
A11YF2VHP2N1IA B00IAQ3RJM 5 1398038400 22 This is a very fun game. I just started playing it. So far so good. I don't see any advertisement s yet.
A11YF2VHP2N1IA B00EKDZEF4 5 1378339200 40 Very fun game. I think I like it more then candy crush saga. The fruits get a little blurry after playing for awhile!  The best part is that you don't have lives. You can play as long as you want.
A11YF2VHP2N1IA B00BMH4GQE 5 1363824000 23 This is a good game. Pretty much like all the other word games but still fun. Some levels are easy some are harder.
A11YFQSB8EYEH B00G9B1MEM 1 1396051200 21 it wouldn't download correctly. it looks like a great game but it just wouldn't download. DISAPPOINTING but it still looks cool
A11YFQSB8EYEH B00CRLSN4U 3 1372809600 22 some are too hard for kids. only the newer ones. wish it was better. I like trains a lot. Jojo's is awesome
A11YFQSB8EYEH B00992CF6W 5 1402876800 57 I know everyone says that this is the best app ever and they aren't lying! This app isn't only a game for fun by  it also uses your imagination. Build houses, fight off zombies, and much more! If you don't get this app, you are crazy. It is definitely worth 7 bucks!!!! The only downside is nothing
A11YFQSB8EYEH B006LPF1VG 1 1342569600 29 I NEVER could make the guy barf. never ever get this app or you will waste you time. all u do is touch ingredients to make the kid barf
A11YFQSB8EYEH B00CTQ6SIG 5 1372723200 27 if you don't have this app you're missing out! this is the best app ever! this app is the best on my kindle fire! GET THIS APP
A11YFQSB8EYEH B004VGH93A 5 1340755200 23 This app made me laugh so hard. I reccomened it for teenagers because of some bad words. You will enjoy it a lot!
A11YHO7U7ZI29U B0067VKQLE 5 1328572800 88 bigfish games announced that this is the number one game of the year! and I agree! a coworker suggested this game to me and i dont regret buying this app at all! I'm very excited they made a kindle fire version of this, and at a deal! this is a strategy game that you can play different levels over and over but choose diff plants to defend ur home. this game on apple is 9.99 and on bigfish games 6.99.. so it's really a great deal for 2.99.
A11YHO7U7ZI29U B004HGK6FW 5 1346198400 21 I love the simple layout and play this often on my kindle fire. haven't had any problems at all with it.
A11YHO7U7ZI29U B0062OFUNU 5 1329868800 40 there is a very easy to access list of all the food places I buy from, it even includes weight watcher points and u can add certain places to ur favorites located at the top. very nice. worth the price.
A11YHO7U7ZI29U B0061S5NNO 5 1332979200 214 I was always the person to say &quot;I know I cant diet, I love food too much&quot;... and trying to keep track of calories without a program to help keep track gets discouraging! I'm also the type to give up before even really giving it my all. I got this app on my kindle fire and was amazed, it has such a large library of foods including restaurant and fast foods, and you don't have to have wifi to use it every day. I didn't get serious with this until I looked up the stuff I was eating regularly, and it really gave me a wake up call. I was eating three times or more the DAILY amount of calories I should have been. I put that I'd like to lose 2 lbs. per week and so far the first month was successful! Best part is, I'm not hungry like I thought I'd be, I just make better choices. Don't get me wrong, I still have a small chickfila milkshake every week, but I know on that day that I'll need to eat grilled chicken and salad for dinner (or something healthier). If anything it's worth a try since it's free. several of my coworkers are now using it and have had success too!
A11YJIF6UDNZDL B006D1ONE4 5 1331251200 61 This is an amazingly well-designed puzzle game, marvelously illustrated, inventively conceived, with an incredible number of levels. The star system adds its own reason for replaying levels to score higher, and the few hidden objects add yet another. To top things off, the splash screens give a sense of story, as well. Highly addictive for young and old alike. Bravo, Disney!
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B006OCM0G0 5 1330905600 33 This app is soooo addicting. I love it so much. I recommend it to anybody who loves games that are fun... and never ending! You have to get this app!! Just DO IT!!

A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B008K3OOJM 5 1345852800 21 best game ever. i like that it is 3D so it looks SO real. Good activity for keeping the kids quiet!!
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B009ZKSPDK 5 1356220800 34 This game is great. It is just like minecraft ... but cheaper. I am happy.I bout this cuz I saved $3. Also.... it is even better than minecraft.  The graphics are WAY clearer. &deg;&mdash;&deg;
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B0086700CM 5 1338940800 27 I've been waiting for this app to come out forever....and FINALLY it is out!!!! I love TEMPLE RUN with all my heart&lt;3 Best game ever!! BUY IT!!!!!!!
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B007TNQ7EY 1 1355702400 51 This tame is really fun .... yet it took up ALL my data space on my kindle. I cant buy any other games and I am very mad. And the price is way to high. 7 dollars is way to much to pay for a RIP OFF GAME. DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B00AIUUXHC 1 1364169600 20 when tried to buy it, the game crashed. I love this game on the ipod, but not kindle. oh well
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B008XG1X18 5 1346976000 39 This app is so much fun to go on. I could sit on it all day ( which I do! ) and just pin things. If you like funny pix, DIY crafts, and everything else, this is ur app!!!
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B00992CF6W 1 1388534400 30 the only problem is that on my kindle fire, I am not able to delete my worlds. I have tried multiple times, and nothing seems to work. also MANY glitches!!!!
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B007SXYAIA 1 1354406400 20 Is there such thing as a laughing plate? I think this game is so stupid. Prob for little kids. Booooooo
A11YMRFYIC8FN5 B0061SLW7A 5 1331769600 27 this app lets you say whatever you want. I called him a jerk and he got mad at me. this is better than talking to my grandma
A11YSK95U6FNGV B004ZFK600 5 1313625600 55 Awesome app, I&apos;m able to txt from my acer iconia tab a500, and a spare htc hd2 using wifi!As for the people that rated this app a low score because they lack the understanding to see how to benefit from having this app, and it was free when they got it.  Think before you rate!
A11YSK95U6FNGV B004HIGDV6 1 1304380800 23 Doesn't support the use of the front facing camera, even though it defaults to it?  Just shows slanted lines on my Mytouch 4g
A11YSK95U6FNGV B004S80UUU 5 1305676800 37 Simple design, catchy music, too hard for most people, including myself.  If you play games to relax, skip this.  If you like a challenging rhythm game that will test your patience, by all means grab this gem.
A11YSK95U6FNGV B004UBUK4Q 4 1304121600 24 Very simple, spent hours on it w/o even realizing it.  Definitely worth getting if you want a simple puzzler that has strategy shooting elements.
A11YUCAQOLYJK7 B00CH26TL8 5 1381968000 68 I love this game! There were a few bugs with the last update but those have been fixed, thanks for that!  The game always runs smoothly on my Kindle HD FIRE and  any  balls bounced off of walls go right where you'd expect them to. Now if only more of my friends played so I could get more lives, 5 just isn't enough for something so addicting lol.
A11YUCAQOLYJK7 B0064X7B4A 5 1367625600 37 My Mom and used to pay scrabble together all the time. Now that I'm all grown up with a family of my own, we can still play all the time on our kindles. I love this game!
A11YUCAQOLYJK7 B004H6WTJI 5 1372291200 73 This app helps hold yourself accountable for what you put in your body and your exercise. I don't think I could have lost 40 pounds (and counting!) without it!  I love that most products are easily searchable and scanable.  I think one of the most unique features is the ability (and ease) of inputting your own recipes so that you don't have to enter every ingredient when you eat a home cooked meal.
A11YUCAQOLYJK7 B008XME36E 5 1388102400 26 Check this app daily to find all sorts of free books. This makes it so easy to never run out of books to get lost in!
A11YV92EOI416G B0058VW36U 5 1340150400 39 this app is brilliant! totaly worth $0.99! i would pay $2.99 for this! there is always new updates with new boxes with new features so u wont get bord with it.PLEASE BUY THIS~ALONG WITH CUT THE ROPE EXPERIMENTS ($0.99)
A11YV92EOI416G B00A3WTXQ2 5 1353801600 64 this app is pretty simple,  but this little guy keeps you wanting to play more!!there are so many different versions of this type of game, and this is probably my favorite version.this app is great for anyone when they are bored and have nothing else to do. this app will for sur bring a smile to their face.i advise you to download this app.
A11YV92EOI416G B007MNV5WU 2 1340150400 47 i dont wanna pay $2.99 for this just caus its in HD. and they only have this not even a standars $0.99 version. i want a free version. and i would buy this on my iPod. its only $0.99DONT BLOW YOUR $$$ JUST CAUS IT SAYS &quot;HD&quot;
A11YWHSBY47E3I B004SCG69A 5 1329004800 39 This is one of my favorote games. It is so fun. you can do lots of stuff. you should get this game. it is also my friends favorite game too. he was the one who showed me this game.
A11YWHSBY47E3I B0058VW36U 5 1343174400 43 this is an awesome game me and my buddy were playing it all day and it is better then the free one. if u want an awesome and fun game this is the game for u. [Written by my 11 year old daughter.]
A11YWHSBY47E3I B006OCM13M 5 1333152000 37 I like how you hag your own bakery. it is great for all ages. you should get this app. the onley thing I don't like about this app is that you can onley get gems with money.
A11YWHSBY47E3I B009HKL4B8 5 1351728000 28 this game is great it takes a while to conect to the Internet at first but othervthen that it is great. you can create you'd own dream city.
A11YY4WISVSMRO B0093QQAEM 5 1365984000 20 I don't get any TV reception where I stay on the weekends, so this is fun to watch and enjoy.
A11YY4WISVSMRO B00ILI95HW 5 1393804800 26 I caught on very quickly. Lots of fun. You just want to go faster and faster..I think people of all ages will have funwith this one.
A11YY4WISVSMRO B007SYDYLS 3 1346889600 21 I enjoy the game, but, it is a little difficult for the grandchildren. Keep up the good work with word games.
A11YY4WISVSMRO B00BL0I7WG 4 1369785600 32 This is a fun mind working game. I really enjoy it to keep my mind busy. Sometimes the objects are a little hard to find but I guess that is the challange.
A11YY4WISVSMRO B00FWPWNKS 4 1383436800 22 It's very fun and relaxing to play, but once you get to level 24, it is very hard and not fun anymore.
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B004KAL2BC 5 1341792000 25 I think this has awesome features that let's me use twitter with ease.  notification choices,lists,retweet with or without comments, lists of options when touching comments
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B004Z92T9W 4 1314403200 20 uninstalled, reinstalled, works, cute, but the tap option not working, only the slide feature works on my phone. Samsung Instinct-Virgin
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B004GJDQT8 5 1319328000 65 this is the perfect tool for shopping. look up the name brand item # find a price. i did this in a store saved myself $70 right on the spot! ordred item and it was sent to my door. i get electronics kids video games and even garage door parts. i have saved $$ hundreds of $$ using amazon now this app mkes it easier!
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B0051UP5NQ 5 1319587200 44 this app is better than expected and i am surprised it works and LOOKS awome on my phone. great for starting docs while on the go. i agree i will transfer to computer to do a full edit before presentation. over all great app.
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B005K9V776 4 1323302400 20 Samsung Instinct doesn't install looks like a cool game can't fully rate since i can't install it hope they fix.
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B0067Q42BY 5 1334016000 23 only on level3 so far. colorful graphics well designed runs smoothly on my ZTE Warp.i would recommend this game to avid majong players.
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B004T2P7MQ 5 1327881600 78 i have been using intuit on line for years B4 apps were even invented. i liked quicken but i was looking for something more simple that blended ALL of my assets together.  THIS IS IT zillow lets me know my home value vs what i owe i have checking, savings. credit cards, even cedit union can work with this app. i don't have to key in a thing, all my transactions from all institutions in one app!!!  AWSOME!
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B00846HN02 1 1342915200 47 tried test drive,said my internet connection is too slow, I am standing next to Wi-Fi hub full bars,so what gives? installed, accepted terms, selected food category and force closes each time. sounded like a cool app but I guess not compatible with ZTE WARP for Boost mobile
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B007EC27QM 5 1382140800 43 Just what I need for every day kind of calcuations. Hard to find the good balance of bright colors, big keys, and my % sign on the main keys. Lets face it. Most of just need it to calculate shopping, tips and  bills.
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B005V1N71W 5 1319328000 55 i love this app because not only doe it  learn what i like, but it also won't play that anoying song(s) i don't like. great to make a catagory for exercising, relaxing or driving in the car. i plug my phone into car  and it rocks! (mitsubishi lancer has plug to adapt phones to speakers)
A11YZSEN83VHQ3 B005DO1N2W 5 1329177600 28 surprisingly accurate.  cute graphics. easy to understand. i like the reminder.  i find myself reading it at lunch and already things are going according to what is predicted.
A11Z4DF1RM55J5 B00FAPF5U0 5 1401494400 21 I love this game it is so much fun u need to get it there are no other game popping up
A11Z4DF1RM55J5 B00H526IU2 5 1404777600 20 I love this game it is so much fun to build your own hotel it is the best game ever
A11Z4DF1RM55J5 B00EBQRZBG 3 1385942400 21 I think this game is good. But I think it can be better this is because some r really really hard
A11Z5O8NF424FN B005EIRU6U 4 1376006400 20 my mother really enjoyed this game. it was easy to learn .  would recommend it to her friends and family.
A11Z82A0X7KN8 B00GOZQ2E8 4 1391817600 37 I'm really only reviewing this for the free gold, but so far it's a solid, fun game. There are a ton of games very similar to this one but it stands out in its own unique way.
A11Z82A0X7KN8 B00INC0ENU 3 1399680000 48 I really like this game. It is not necessary to purchase gems because you can earn them during the course of the game, but I bought some anyway. The problem is I never received them. I was charged for them and there's no way to get a refund.
A11Z82A0X7KN8 B00CTQ6SIG 4 1402963200 33 If you're a fan of the Simpsons you're gonna love this time-waster. My only complaint is that the donut currency doesn't come easily, and good chunk of content can't be obtained without them.
A11Z82A0X7KN8 B009HKL4B8 3 1378080000 20 Not bad for what it is. I loved the pc Sims games. Now if only someone would port Rollercoaster Tycoon...
A11ZBZVWFNHRT B00FIW5BZE 4 1401321600 24 Good game fast paced for those who like machining. One drawback the game does not let you know how many matches you have left
A11ZBZVWFNHRT B007BH7T90 5 1396742400 24 This app has more game boards than most. It has provided many hours of fun. I can use it when waiting on an appointment.
A11ZDEV3LL2QC2 B004IALZTS 5 1365120000 33 This is absolutely a great game.It's relaxing, challenging and fun to work against that silly antique office fan!It beats getting out of the chair to pick up that wadded ball of paper, LOL.
A11ZDEV3LL2QC2 B004SJ3AXI 5 1365120000 28 Truly a wonderful challenging game.At times it is too difficult, but that's what keeps me going...I just know I can do this!The seasons makes it even more appreciative!
A11ZDEV3LL2QC2 B004K4RY9M 5 1365120000 29 Word searching helps me to exercise my eyes.While eye, brain activity is going on, I am re-acquainting with the spelling of words I don't use on a daily basis.
A11ZF4I861J1RG B004SCQABY 3 1301702400 47 Truly a fun game.  Love the fast forward button. The graphics are mediocre and I would appreciate improvement in that area. One of its flaws is that it takes up tons of space.  19MB of space for this game is a bit ridiculous.  Please fix it. EVO.
A11ZF4I861J1RG B004HIGDV6 4 1304380800 41 Loads of fun and creates lots of memorable moments. Front and rear camera works on the EVO. However the photo effect for black &amp; white and antique look nearly identical. Please fix it and possibly add more effects and other customizations.
A11ZF4I861J1RG B004VFJMYK 5 1306627200 66 Loved loved the free version of cardio trainer from the past nine months I have used it. The pro version is by far the best! I adore the pro trainer features. Great motivation to get off your feet and get moving. I was super excited when I saw that amazon made this the free app for the day. It is well worth the price. EVO 4G.
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B007U7IKVM 5 1382227200 23 It is not like those games were you tap and I makes a sound. it interacts with all the objects on the gun.
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B00IZQOZB6 4 1395705600 35 I love this game. Just love it. But you have to wait for energy... and it's a 15 min regen.... hopefully you see the problem. Fix that, I'd rate it 5 stars. Great game though!
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B00G6ZTM3Y 4 1388534400 61 Hi, I love this game, but it gets a 4 since it can't connect with my friends iPad. We are  not able to connect since he has 3106 and I have 2701. What is that supposed to mean? I've tried updating mine by deleting it but it hasn't worked. He is too far in the game to lose everything. Please help.
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392422400 21 This game is very fun, addictive, and frustrating, but I definitely reccomend it. Very similar to flappy bird. I like it.
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B0067VKQLE 4 1378944000 46 Great game, I love it, but many people are waiting for the release  of pVz 2. I know that it is released on the ioS store, I have on my dad's Iphone, but why Isn't it released on the Amazon App Store? We are waiting popcap....
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B00J06HWC4 4 1396915200 31 This game is awesome. I have played it on a Samsung galaxy tablet. But for some reason it's an INCREDIBLY slow download, when it finishes, it tries to install, then fails.
A11ZIVJI4R5MPK B00CPPXYC4 5 1387670400 21 You should play if you like tapped out clash of clans and other games likethis.I think you should download this app.*****
A11ZJLALD3UPTY B00881VLCE 4 1404950400 15 Lik the game, ads keep interfering with play and had to get back to puzzle.
A11ZJLALD3UPTY B00AQ5A88S 2 1403308800 27 The ads keep coming on the full screen during play and it is annoying.  Would niot download this game again.  The other one like it is good.
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00CKOYVG8 5 1394323200 22 This is a fun game with new games every week...you don't even have to be a physicist to figure it out! Lol.
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00A2BJSE6 5 1358726400 24 So addicting!great purchase for my kindle fire hd. I wish there were more games like these, more like different choices to play candy swipe
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00A3NQNUU 5 1374537600 37 I love this game, it's awesome. The only thing is that you may end up spending more money to buy better dragons and treats..But still worth it. Also, you could never go wrong with rearranging your park!
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00EKDZEF4 4 1381104000 20 This is a fun game.... pretty addictive worth the .99 cents. It would be nice to have candy crush saga....though.
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00IS87HYI 5 1402012800 20 Thank you for adding this game to KINDLE fire users! Now you have to add farm heros, papal pear saga!
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00AHNC0SK 5 1394496000 46 This I s a fun game. It's kind of like Dragon vale...However you do have to buy tickets to build rides, shops. This is where they get you. But still creative way to spend time. Still waiting for pet rescue saga. For my kindle fire addition.
A11ZMI7IQJ2F0D B00CH26TL8 5 1394409600 28 Great game, but when are they going to release pet rescue saga, pepper pear saga, farm rescue saga....come on just give to hose who own a KINDLE fire!!!!!
A11ZN595F0JESA B00J68TF6W 5 1400198400 20 This game is amazingly addictive. Few games keep my attention for as long as this one has. I love it.
A11ZN595F0JESA B00BJ4ETBW 4 1366934400 21 This is good simple fun. It is enjoyable to play and a decent time killer while sitting in a waiting room.I
A11ZN6YJ44S369 B004SHLE2Y 3 1371340800 20 This is real good for a few laughs especially out in public.You should see peoples faces when they hear this
A11ZN6YJ44S369 B00HHBXYGM 5 1391472000 25 This game is very addicting! Great graphics and holds your interest.Game runs smoothly with no problems I highly recommend it if you like matching games.
A11ZN6YJ44S369 B0050KEVO6 3 1371340800 21 This is an ok game but just didn't hold my interest.I like the fact that my grandchildren like it.Keeps them busy
A11ZN6YJ44S369 B005AKD836 2 1371340800 22 I could not find one single book that interested me.It is a good app for people that like these kinds of books
A11ZN6YJ44S369 B004GMJKTK 4 1371340800 21 This is another game I use to pass the time.Its really all I use it for. I like this game. Thanks
A11ZOQ6ECPLY4H B009ZZDNT6 3 1355529600 27 Good, but I expected some more! Well I know, it's free!!!!! Even though i thoutght I may get some better app because it really look good !
A11ZOQ6ECPLY4H B007CK1MEY 3 1355529600 23 Too fancy not interesting. The backgrounds are kind of out of tune. I really did not enjoy this game. Too out of phase.
A11ZOQ6ECPLY4H B008IJTFYW 3 1355529600 20 Nice sounds.I liked it very much, even though is a little less than what I expected, nice application to relax.
A11ZQ4YH59J92T B009ZE27US 1 1367020800 29 I am 11 and it said I was 42. what the crap I don't even look 42 or even act like it. take my advice and don't get it
A11ZQ4YH59J92T B009UX2YAC 5 1359504000 22 I think it was a very good game. I don't care what you thought about it but I know I loved it
A11ZQ4YH59J92T B004VGH93A 5 1362182400 24 I love this game. it has the funniest yo mama jokes ever. I recommend it for anyone but kids should ask before they get
A11ZQ4YH59J92T B0086700CM 5 1360972800 21 I love it. if you like this game you should try temple run 2.this was the hes game I ever played
A11ZTKGR0SLIVM B00D9CNAOY 5 1399939200 46 This game was on my kindle while I was in the hospital and it was something I could not put down. Even my heart doctor sat down for a few seconds to look at it. It was much better than dealing with the tv they have.
A11ZU7QEEEMGPD B008RA3X5E 4 1352678400 23 easy to use, couple of the alarms are super loud on my kindle fire. like how u can pick your own music too
A11ZU7QEEEMGPD B009RC8UFO 5 1351468800 26 helping to pass the time. I like the help/hint button that doesn't have  penalties  to use. only played for a few minutes....I'll update if it sucks.
A11ZU7QEEEMGPD B00785P2QC 5 1351468800 22 addicting. like how its more interactive than the city, bakery, restaurant, farm story games. Actually seems like you're apart of the city.
A11ZUN3BMAXJQV B008878MQQ 5 1380499200 41 I just can't put it down. I been playing this game all day. Just change put it down. It give me plenty of bonus very fun game. Don't hesitate to get this game too much fun. Time to put it down.
A11ZUN3BMAXJQV B00CNT8KW6 5 1376092800 20 I give this game a 5 stars I love it. It s:-)Everyone should try it. Don't hesitate get the game
A1201F8RRSRE3S B00CRLSN4U 4 1396828800 24 Hints are reasonable and you can even have the answer solved. Some movies are repeated answers. Other than that, its a overall good game.
A1201F8RRSRE3S B00HFTHXMC 1 1396828800 43 This game was going along fine until I got to level 19, the screen went blue and it restarted me to level 1. This happened twice, so its just not a good game. I was playing it on a Kindle Fire HDX 16gb.
A1201F8RRSRE3S B0066TUXU6 3 1389657600 63 I joined Hulu Plus because Abc.com now required you to login with a approved cable company to watch shows that you had missed on regular tv. Since I have basic no subscribed cable, I signed up for Hulu Plus at 7.99/mo. While I can watch the shows, I don't think there should be any ads in them. It should be more like netflix.
A1201F8RRSRE3S B00GY0HJ4K 3 1394323200 61 Great game except it sometimes shuts the app down with little warning. You can get away with not doing in app purchases so long as your patient. Update: this game restarted completely after I had played 77 levels, there were still plenty to go clear to 180 that I could see. So I'm not to thrilled to have to start over.
A1201F8RRSRE3S B00B3WD78Q 4 1394323200 21 This game reminds me of playing scratch tickets like bingo when you double check your numbers. It's pretty addictive and fun.
A1201F8RRSRE3S B00DFW3818 2 1387843200 50 This app is pricey if you need to skip a song or eliminate letters for guesses. It freezes and its price screen for buying coins is incorrect. If you want to buy coins the 2nd screen where you confirm your payment you'll notice a BIG difference in price. Be wary.
A1201KUQZC3J3N B00CBUGMZY 5 1375488000 20 This app is the best free app of dress up on my kindle fire hd this app is really fun
A1202WVHLUB841 B007OXASB2 5 1333843200 21 I love playing pet shop story! its good for animal lover's like me. I reccomend this to everyone who reads this
A1202WVHLUB841 B005ZXWMUS 4 1337299200 56 netflix is a app off course for movies and shows and I use it all the time but.. one star was taken away on my review because they do not have my favorite show pokemon and in the shows under it are violent like south park which is another way this is a 4 star review.
A1202WVHLUB841 B00A8ECU24 5 1353628800 28 I am a brony and i would love to get but i share my tablet with my mom and she would wonder why i have a girly app....
A1202WVHLUB841 B0074OZ29O 2 1333843200 22 I had fun until level 12 then it would close everytime I clicked it I really want to play it some more
A1206VO59P5FF2 B007HH3K5G 3 1334188800 48 I loved it in the beginning and I still do but when there's few animals you can buy with money and when you get to about level 10 there's no more animals without gems to buy. But otherwise great game love the topic and ideas in the game
A1206VO59P5FF2 B007NACZPI 5 1332547200 41 this game is great and loo I'm only rating it for the extra 30 crystals and I need twnety words so hi I like pie and you should to house is under a mouse goat is on a groat and penny
A12087RLITITP5 B00E8KLWB4 4 1391990400 47 If you like searching for things in puzzle like games you will like this game.What makes it more challenging is that it gives you a time limit to find the objects. It has in app game purchases that you can forgo if you have a little patience.
A1209ZYLCMXIYI B009WO7NQO 5 1352332800 24 lightsabers and woookies just make everything betterit is a great addition to the series and I think it will improve the franchise even more.
A120A24GMUTSH7 B0052832G4 5 1344556800 21 This is a good non committal type time waster. Works and looks great on kindle fire.  Doesn't aggravate before sleepy time.....
A120A24GMUTSH7 B0089BPEZS 5 1340755200 30 looks and works great on the kindle fire.  Using my directv account is easy.  All the shows are available and watchlists are a great way to never miss a show.
A120A24GMUTSH7 B00B5KHZA2 2 1360454400 53 There is no zoom feature so I find it difficult to see on a 7&quot; tablet.  I would not buy this again and will delete it from my device.  There are mistakes in the game too.  I wa searching for a &quot; yellow mug&quot;  when the object was, in fact, PURPLE! How frustrating.
A120A24GMUTSH7 B004VOJT0I 1 1345161600 45 This app doesn't have my allrecipes recipe box.  I find it dumb to spin for my recipes.  I would love an allrecipes app that has all the features of the website.  The only use DinnerSpinner has is to entertain you with disgusting yet amusing recipes.
A120AI0164TIQ1 B004SJ3204 1 1358985600 20 i did not like this game at all, no instructions, i would not download this one again. no thank you

A120AI0164TIQ1 B007SYDYLS 1 1358985600 22 i did not like this one at all. i have already deleted it off of my kindle, was not a good game
A120AI0164TIQ1 B009WO7NQO 5 1358985600 22 this was a very good game, my grand sons play this game all the time, it keeps them busy on the kindle
A120AI0164TIQ1 B006BDHAX0 3 1327449600 20 game shuts off after about 25 minutes annoying please. fix it and it would be a good game to play
A120AI0164TIQ1 B008N3TLNI 5 1358985600 20 i like this game very much, it is like yahtzee, you should have more games like this one to download

A120ARTU6PK52Q B00DUGCLY4 4 1378080000 43 this game is fairly fun...the Emojis can be misrepresented at times...making the answer more difficultvthan it really is.  Also there may be a glitch in the game because when you leave it and come back to it...the letter choices are not the same.
A120ARTU6PK52Q B00E8KLWB4 4 1394668800 22 fun....fun...and challenging.  you think you see an object...but alas...the shape changes and becomes another object...good luck!  happy seeking in the secret society...
A120ARTU6PK52Q B00FXKHEK6 4 1385078400 25 this game is rather nostalgic.  many of the cartoons shown are ones I watched when I was just a young girl.fun and challenging or anyone!

A120ARTU6PK52Q B00EBQRSTK 3 1381104000 22 It is an ok game...pictures do not always match what the word should be.  This can be very frustrating to a gamer.
A120ARTU6PK52Q B00G5LQ5MU 4 1387152000 20 a fun game....reminds me of temple run where you must go through several obstacles before you progress to your escape.

A120ARTU6PK52Q B00D0VA0UQ 4 1373846400 22 a fun word game...especially beneficial to those who have trouble spelling words and who are visual learners...it will improve word building...and fun
A120ARTU6PK52Q B00EBE8MUG 4 1381276800 25 Unless you watch the old reruns and the newer Tv shows...you may have a difficult time with this quiz show.  You must be couch potato.
A120C8LQRZNMPT B00FAX6XQC 4 1401840000 24 My Grandson down loaded this one on my kindle fire and he seems to like it I dont play it  but he likes it.
A120C8LQRZNMPT B008AZGWYK 3 1353628800 22 This was ok I needed  it to be  a little bigger...hard to browse on it.i ended up using my lap top instead
A120C8LQRZNMPT B004GMT14Y 4 1401840000 21 It makes it easy to look up words.....and I love the words of the day and best of all it's free
A120C8LQRZNMPT B008878MQQ 2 1365984000 26 I really don't care to gamble on line and I am not buying coins if it was free to play maybe but just not for me
A120C8LQRZNMPT B004S2W37O 4 1401840000 33 I love this calendar . we have a large family and it keeps all informed on appointments Birthday and any other plans, we all get emails and guess what it is free .
A120DBYYNHBPIJ B00GY0HJ4K 5 1390003200 35 It's awesome you have to pay on level 40 but who really cares not me  all the bad reviews of this game are not true ok so you pay so what no one really cares
A120DQKJMWVPNP B00FRM93FE 5 1390089600 39 I have played for hours and have YET to see the beginning of the end.  Great puzzles, great head-scratchers, and really fun times!  I am VERY happy with this game.  I will be checking for more by 3D Methods!!
A120DQKJMWVPNP B00AW3P7Y4 4 1396396800 28 I love coming back to this again and again. Resisting getting any hints, I often sit and stare, close it, come back...finally to inspired realizations! Great brain workout!
A120DQKJMWVPNP B00GP0G0IK 5 1389398400 30 Really enjoying this puzzle and hog game! I hope it goes a ways more before locking me out to buy more. But I'll be hooked by then... that's the plan!
A120DQKJMWVPNP B008Y2FRFO 4 1389571200 34 Quite fun, as long as I am satisfied with 5 or 10 min of play before I run out of coins. Need to PAY to play longer. Short is sweet. Longer would be better.
A120FANZZVCKZH B00GWJQVVA 5 1388448000 22 It teaches you how to draw good minecraft things and me and my friend Kylah are learning how to draw really good
A120FANZZVCKZH B00CZDSK7K 5 1383955200 27 I love the fact that you can pick your own character and get married and have kids and have a happy life with your husband or wife

A120HPZ0AW090S B006P1UR60 5 1336608000 47 I was surprised something could replace google earth on my kindle this is It. great fun in planning trips and seeing where I'm hiking to and what to expect topographicaly before I get there!  thanks for the the maps I can save to refer to for later!
A120HPZ0AW090S B004UBH4S6 5 1330214400 22 love it! so accurate! I was so surprised how it related to me. I am telling all my friends about this app.
A120IC2H0RP9CD B008WXNBWG 4 1374969600 20 good for keeping track of important ideas and leaving messages for the other user of this kindle aka my husband.
A120IC2H0RP9CD B008RA3X5E 5 1374969600 22 The alarm clock will work great for when we travel in our RV and need to be up at a certain time.
A120IC2H0RP9CD B00AXKPWSM 3 1374969600 24 Im not sure how to save and then view the pictures I take. If I can figure it out I will appreciate it more.
A120IDEPOWCLYL B00594XOZU 4 1381795200 32 This app usually works!Don't get confused. I contacted Amazon and they said the app was clutching and they'll fix it as soon as possible. Other from that it's a very useful app.
A120IDEPOWCLYL B008PPGFZG 4 1369008000 24 This app is great but only if you have instagram (the actual thing) on another device cause this app doesn't let you upload pictures...
A120IDEPOWCLYL B009UX2YAC 5 1366416000 32 THIS APP IS AMAZAYN!!!I love it it's so addicting and phenomeniall. I think every one with a tablet should seriously get this app. It's nit only fabulouis but it's also free. FREE!
A120JX8I8KIY54 B0087TQYUG 5 1341187200 26 this game is so much fun I just love it.super fun and easy. its just awesome. it really is a great game. everyone should get it
A120JX8I8KIY54 B0086700CM 5 1343260800 44 I love temple run but once you unlock everything its not as fun but still super fun I could play this game all day it is sooooooooooo much fun and I love competing with my brother to see who can get a higher score
A120N2PVBFQW7L B00HRMNKWE 5 1391817600 21 Fun game. Little easier then other word game. This one is good for kids also. I would recommend for any age.
A120OP1H9EC7RB B009G9KFQ0 5 1377216000 37 I had been using AccuWeather but wasn't getting real accurate reports some of the time.  With  Weather Bug I get better reports on what's happening right now.  AccuWeather is ok but for me Weather Bug is better.
A120OP1H9EC7RB B007ZGO7EM 5 1376179200 47 This is a great calculator.  Nice big numbers, easy to use.  I use this a lot and like it as well as a full size desk calculator.  I was an accountant before retiring and used a lot of different calculators - this is one of my favorites.
A120PTNM0Z5BED B0063GORYU 5 1357516800 34 I enjoy playing this game on my indle and my laptop.  The Kindle I take to work and while out on errands so I wont get bored while standing in a long line somewhere!!
A120PTNM0Z5BED B00A4KVFLY 5 1357516800 24 I have become almost addicted to this game and play it all the time!!  I play on my cell phone, Kindle, and n Facebook.
A120PTNM0Z5BED B005V1N71W 4 1357516800 64 I like having this download because thereare so any option of simularmusic to listen to.  The only thing I dont really like which Im on is pnly listening to one artist at a time instead of skipping from Artist to Artist.  This is why I download and pay for specific songs and not use this until Im tired of listenting to th same songs.
A120PTNM0Z5BED B004K4RY9M 5 1357516800 20 This is easy to pass time for me on my breaks while at work or out running around doing errands.
A120PTNM0Z5BED B0064X7B4A 5 1357516800 37 I play this game daily and will throughout the day if I didnt have a job.  I'm getting much better with my spelling now and plan to play this game until eternity!!  Very easy to download too
A120PTNM0Z5BED B004SD5GZ4 5 1357516800 39 I havent had the pleasure of using this yet but very experience because I use it at work all the tie and on my laptop.  This is nice have on my Kindle to do some writing away from home.
A120PTNM0Z5BED B0066TUXU6 5 1357516800 35 I have heard gr8 things about this program and look forward to using it in the near future.  I will be nice to be away from home and still able to view movies or videos.
A120PTNM0Z5BED B0089BPEZS 5 1357516800 50 I love HBO at home already so having this to be able to take where ever I go is like the greatest gift to myself!!  My job cut of the cable on the tv in our lounge and having this just makes up not being bored like the other folks!!
A120PTNM0Z5BED B00B7KKNI6 5 1404086400 21 Great game to keep up vocabulary and pass time too while you be competitive at the same time:) I highly recommend
A120PTNM0Z5BED B007ZGO7EM 5 1357516800 30 Nice to have this calculator because my math hasnt been all that gr8 since I hit the bit 40!!  This was very easy to download and will get much use!!
A120TCIV95B7AE B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392508800 21 this.is just like flappy bird but it poops ewwwwww why does it do that  . otherwise very good. LOOVE tHe rainbow
A120TCIV95B7AE B00B2V66VS 5 1359936000 23 the first time I got this it crashed the second time it works perf and btw is ammmmmmaaaaaszzzzzzzziiiiiinnnnggggghhg I love tr2 sooooooo much
A120TCIV95B7AE B00AM5JTV4 5 1358640000 26 the turtle is sooooooooooo cute that's. why. I. got this app that and I know lots of Morons ...Teehee :) n;)  so I hope its good
A120TPFR821VSB B007HBA70S 1 1331251200 42 i payed for this app and it sucks! it doesnt work it keeps taking me to the same little game over and over again. contacted the maker of this app HeroCraft and nothing from them. thanks for nothing just waste of money.
A120TPFR821VSB B006ZE9Q5A 4 1330905600 31 This game has very nice design, and the games are very different love the riddles! Wish there were more chapters and even liked the cheese jokes that are in the dialoge.
A120TPFR821VSB B0085CEBGY 4 1338076800 38 i bought the first one and this also! i love it wish they fix that when playing for a little it just crashes and starts again but over all just love it! please make more games like this!
A120TPFR821VSB B004T2QZL8 4 1332201600 32 I really like this game nice graphics but after I played it for 10 minutes now it just force closes on my tmobile g2...please fix so I can give you 5 stars
A120TPFR821VSB B009AY04A8 1 1377561600 42 I give it 1 star because for me there is to much dialog and everytime you zoom in and out it marks as you are trying to click on an object after a few of those it penalties you 20 sec. Everytime.
A120VPMBCHTEAN B00GCI69D6 1 1397088000 21 I tried downloading this app but it will not run. I tried to understand the required procedure but can't go forward.
A120VZHZBTAX11 B006R6VG9K 5 1331164800 30 most free games are Mindanao boring but I really like this one. The only draw back is the lag it sometime causes in Pandora when I am listening and playing.
A120VZHZBTAX11 B00CEBKMN8 5 1375056000 30 This game is totally addictive!!  I am so hooked!  Refills coins faster than other games spins are  great! I would recommend this game for the  you'd and younger at heart!
A120VZHZBTAX11 B009PSV1HE 3 1365292800 26 Like it think it should be free. I am pretty good at it. I bate that you can only play so far without buying the game.
A120VZHZBTAX11 B00FX6ZBXC 5 1387152000 26 I love this game ..though I wish that when other people players enter to play that they would play the game within a decent time frame
A120VZHZBTAX11 B00F1XSETA 5 1378857600 24 our grandkids loves this game! it is hard for them at times;but they need to be challanged to learn! they are 3,5.7 and 11.
A120VZHZBTAX11 B00CX9P6V4 5 1378339200 22 I just downloaded pop the pic. and so far I love the game and so does my two year old does too
A120VZHZBTAX11 B008Y2FRFO 5 1351814400 25 please someone email me @ threed333@yahoo.com and tell me how to start the puzzles... past the 10th level?!?!? I am addicted already that's for sure!!!
A120VZHZBTAX11 B00FCYEZOQ 5 1389312000 20 I love this brand game it keeps me asking the kids for the answers that I do not know haha
A120VZTMZCWSNJ B008N04TMO 5 1346803200 29 I absolutely enjoyed it. I purchased this about eight to help me unwind after work and the next I knew it was nearly one am. I would definitely recommend.
A120VZTMZCWSNJ B008O661PK 5 1374796800 23 I loved. this game. definatly one of the best I've. played. this. series just gets better and better. I would. recommend. for anyone
A120VZTMZCWSNJ B0097EWK3A 4 1375228800 21 I enjoyed. playing. this game it has plenty. of hidden object scenes. and fun puzzles. I liked the story. and graphics
A120WSNGO1WG8D B00C2AMWVG 5 1364947200 334 This game is amazing. Alright so this is put into a bunch of different single player and multiplayer modes. The multiplayer mode is still a dead zone because of the lack of players. But there are still a bunch of fun single player modes to play while you wait. So there are four modes, practice match, quick match,body count, and story mode. Practice is where you can test weapons or do whatever you want while the enemy worms just stand there waiting to get hit. Quick match speaks for itself. Body count is where you have to try and hit the enemy worms before they get you(I haven't gotten to play it very much yet) story mode is more or less a tournament mode  where you have to play against a bunch of preselected teams which get harder and harder. The maps are randomly made which are infinite. He weapons are very different from each other and are the pinnacle of the gameplay. Fromgrenades to melee attacks to exploding sheep this game has a lot.  With about 20 weapons you'll have a blast. The game doesn't make you sign up for anything or anything like that unless you want to look up the leaderboards. The customization is wonderful. You can customize your comrades names,skin color,accent,base,hat, and gravestone for when one of your comrades gets its health at zero or drowns. Overall rating: 10/10. Even if you're a long time fan or new player you'll still have a blast. With the superior graphics, smooth and exciting gameplay, numerous weapons and accents that'll make you want to laugh till it hurts(or until you notice your turn just ended because of it) this is by far the best game I have ever played on a mobile device ever before. So I hope this will help any buyers who are on the fence about the price I will say again that this is definitely worth the price tag and you will have a blast playing this amazing game.
A120Y6UVSINR36 B004GYY714 2 1365120000 56 I uninstalled it because it was not useful for me. First, its size was too big for running on my device (Kindle Fire), so it consumed a lot of resources. Second, although the app presented a large selection of local radio stations, it was unable to play most of them. The same occurred for international broadcasts.
A120Y6UVSINR36 B004LOMB2Q 3 1365120000 207 Actually, this app is excellent and it has been very useful for me since I have installed it from the first time. I have my notes, thoughts, ideas, images, my job's info, etc. recorded and organized easily and instantly. But recently, I have had many difficulties synchronizing my info and accessing it offline. It is a pain to try to recover info on the Android version; it takes too long to load. Also, after one the the major updates, the app couldn't access the URL to synch notes, notebooks and other stuff; it did not recognize or accept my password. I had to log out, restart the device, restart the app, and login, only to find out that all the info wasn't there any more. Then, I had to wait some time for the app to retrieve everything again via Wi-Fi from Evernote server. Now, I am scared when I find new update requests, which  are very often now, because I don't want to go through again for a new process for changing passwords, restarting, synchronizing the WHOLE stuff again, authenticating users, wondering why the app does not work any more, or finding solutions on the Internet. In short, fearing that new updates will mess everything up.
A120Y6UVSINR36 B004I744AS 5 1335052800 72 It is a very useful dictionary; the search engine is fast, the app offers a vast selection of definitions and grammar information, it provides spoken pronunciation hints as well as phonetic transcriptions, and also it includes a translation option for a few languages. It is also important to mention that this app includes a Thesaurus option as well as a section for searching specialized terms in fields such as medicine and law.
A120Y6UVSINR36 B008KYOCA2 3 1384387200 62 It's OK. It is a useful app and it serves the purpose it is intended. The interface is simple and user friendly. It has reminder alarms and colorful icons to represent different events on a calendar view. In my opinion,  its use of 7.8 MB of ROM memory is too large for an app of this sort. This feature should be optimized.
A120Y6UVSINR36 B0094BB4TW 3 1369180800 94 I think this app is okay. It looks nice, it has a lot of options to navigate on my Facebook account, the interface is easy to use, but what I don't like is the fact that I always have to wait a long time for the app to refresh. Refreshing and updating processes are too slow; they take so long that I usually get mad so I end up quitting the app. I do not use it anymore, because it is faster to check my account using the web browser of my Kindle Fire.
A121523X20MPDQ B00D6SBOWG 2 1387497600 41 I have Fairway Solitaire on my iPod touch, but I can't connect the game on my Kindle to my existing game, like I can with Words with Friends.  Also, the Kindle edition doesn't have daily challenges like the iPod touch edition.
A121523X20MPDQ B00E8KLWB4 4 1392249600 55 I love to play hidden picture games, but at times I find it a little difficult to find some of the items.  For this reason I can't give this game 5 stars.  Also, don't like the idea that I feel like I have to add friends, follow twitter, or join something in order to advance.
A12156ZF3F127L B00HDRTGDK 3 1392595200 50 Challenging game not completely familiar with all the 90s games/toys/products/movie question so sometimes stuck on a question especially if I'm not connected to the internet and can't google the answer. Plus I think the 15token use to show a letter or remove letters is a bit much should be less
A12156ZF3F127L B00DJFIMW6 4 1390867200 21 Just as exciting and challenging as subway surfers and the fact the gaming sounds from the minions enhance the gaming experience
A1218HFGIL3O1B B00CRHF748 5 1396742400 23 My kids and I both enjoy playing this!! I have puzzles for myself and then I have purchased some puzzles for my kids.
A1218HFGIL3O1B B00BWBHIUG 4 1396742400 29 I was skeptical about this game but my two year old son loves it and doesn't need much help in playing it. His older brothers enjoy it as well.
A1218HFGIL3O1B B00FB13Y74 2 1396742400 54 You have to be careful on how much you move your phone or else you go off the track. I downloaded it for my kids and they couldn't play it because of how sensitive it is. Also, it needed to be updated and it wouldn't so I uninstalled it. I wont be missing it.
A1218HFGIL3O1B B0066WJLU6 2 1396742400 45 This app drained my battery, I wouldn't even have it open and it would drain it all the way down. I had no issues with my battery life until after I downloaded this app. I uninstalled it and now I don't have battery issues anymore.
A121BXNLPW2V84 B006OBWGHO 5 1335225600 26 My daughter loves to play this. Its a favorite when in the car. Reminds my husband of World of Goo, but for kids. Well worth getting.
A121BXNLPW2V84 B006VXRNYG 5 1335225600 34 My daughter loves to draw and this gives her an outlet to be creative when on the go. She especially likes to watch her drawings come to life with the movie option. Pretty cool.
A121BXNLPW2V84 B007VCVCAM 3 1335225600 25 Thought the game was just ok. The controls to move Garfield aren't the greatest. Makes it difficult to play. Maybe I just need more practise...
A121BXNLPW2V84 B004K4RY9M 3 1335225600 50 I love word searches, and was excited when I found this. However the words are super easy to find, not to mention that there are only a few to look-up on each search. I do like the timing feature, but it isn't enough to earn a better rating from me.
A121DLD8UFM8U0 B00CEVALHA 4 1386460800 23 Super fun but I wish it didn't take so long to do certain things. But alas, you can't have it all. Still enjoyable.
A121DLD8UFM8U0 B008XG1X18 5 1348790400 20 Love this app and it works GREAT on my Kindle Fire. So happy to finally be able to check pinterest.
A121DLD8UFM8U0 B007PT3QOQ 3 1334448000 124 I love this app. However, I do not love that when it freezes &amp; I have to restart my kindle &amp; open the game again, all my crops, businesses, houses &amp; animals say there's 180 hours until I can collect again. It's happened to me twice now &amp; the only way I can figure out how to fix it is to uninstall &amp; reinstall the game. This time, I'm not reinstallling unless the issue is somehow fixed. I'm incredibly disappointed because I love this game &amp; don't even mind waiting for the energy to refill (I do other things &amp; come back to the game later). I'll miss playing on my Kindle Fire, but the game hasn't messed up on my android phone yet.
A121IJJ1Z1ARJC B0067Q42BY 5 1329609600 34 I love this version of mahjong! It is really nice that it does a full tutorial to help beginners like my little girl but also has harder levels for the more advanced players. Awesome
A121IJJ1Z1ARJC B00CWY76CC 5 1375142400 26 this game is so addictive! my 8 yr old is obsessed with beating every level. I hope they add more levels so she can keep going.
A121IZ5ZEWF42J B00AFMLJY4 5 1355616000 21 I love the fashion on the game. Great if you love fashion. I love fashion.  so I like the game !!!!!!!!!
A121IZ5ZEWF42J B0067Q4PQQ 5 1349654400 23 This game is really addicting. It was really slow loading it but I think it was totally worth it. I love this game!!!!
A121IZ5ZEWF42J B0063IH60K 5 1367884800 23 This app is great!!! I love playing solitaire on my iphone and kindle fire!! I don't enjoy the ads but they aren't bad.
A121IZ5ZEWF42J B008GUNBOI 3 1346716800 32 I don't really get this game. If it had less adds and more flavors in the free version it would would be better. I don't understand the make your own shake one.
A121IZ5ZEWF42J B00I8Q77Y0 4 1393804800 22 I love flappy wings because I did not get flappy birds in time. I hate the poop because it looks like chocolate.
A121J21B7GYNHT B007BFSYMS 5 1360281600 20 The white noise app is comforting especially coming from the kindle fire hd .....like the variety of sounds....just right ...
A121J21B7GYNHT B008R9OIUO 5 1348185600 34 If you like hunting for objects, this is the game for you!!!! The color graphics are beautiful.....very addictive game for me, when I start playing I don't want to put my Kindle Fire down.
A121J21B7GYNHT B00E4MCCF6 5 1391472000 20 I like this easy colorful puzzle, many choices.  the pieces are already rotated, can finish one in an evening time...
A121J21B7GYNHT B00CRHF748 1 1387670400 21 I have the rotation on, but can't get the pieces to rotate, therefore, can't fit the pieces.....probably will delete this puzzle...
A121JE4R15XWNI B004SYP5WC 5 1383955200 22 HighlyThis has been a great tool to budget mymoney.  very easy to set up and edit as needed.  Would highly reccomend this.
A121K7DIEEGQNK B006IY163C 1 1324771200 58 This is one of the worst &quot;Free&quot; apps of the day, let alone having it for Christmas Day. I didn't listen to reviews and downloaded it anyway, only to uninstall it immediately afterward. Don't bother downloading this. It is all advertising. The only decent, truly free game, is missile command and the controls are horrible. Thanks Amazon. :-(
A121K7DIEEGQNK B004QOP62S 1 1320796800 42 In the middle of the first game (which was fun), the program seemed to use up more and more RAM or CPU to the point that it wouldn't respond to anything. I had to pull the battery on my Evo 4g. :(
A121KT22TITKJW B00HY5QKHQ 4 1393286400 30 Lots of fun not to crazy about the online play only if they could make it to where I can play offline by my self then it would be best
A121KT22TITKJW B009DRL9YM 4 1351468800 23 Only reason not a five star is the Internet connection required if it didnt need that I would give a five star :)
A121KT22TITKJW B007V2UGPE 5 1341446400 42 Lots of fun but should really fix the bug that resents the game so you lose all your progress. But its so fun that I enjoy playing it a second time just wont spend money on it till they fix that bug.
A121KXLT6YNMVD B006HJKKCG 5 1380931200 27 First and only voice translator I have found to be actually useful in communicating with others who speak and understand little or no English. Excellent voice recognition.
A121KXLT6YNMVD B004SOR4H6 3 1390176000 139 This is the best twitter app I've found for my Kindle Fire HD, but that's not saying much for it. I'm mainly bothered with the way it handles photos. Suppose I swipe through 30 or 40 photos to get to one I want to view. This app stores them all in its cache folder at sdcard/android/data/com.twitter.android/cache/photos. This would be OK if it just cached them there temporarily and then cleaned up after itself when I closed the app. But if it ever cleans up after itself, it doesn't do it often. It stores thousands of photos I've never seen or wanted to see. You can manually delete these, but clearing application data did not get rid of them for me. If you manually delete, be careful. Your wallpaper and a copy of your profile pic is in there too.
A121KXLT6YNMVD B007ZGO7EM 5 1401062400 68 I also keep a scientific calculator on my phone/tablet. But when I need to make a quick and simple calculation while shopping I find a very simple calculator like this one useful. It stays right there on my home screen. Now if you are doing matrix algebra every day on your job you may want to skip this one. But for us ordinary folks, it fills a need.
A121L12ID54TSX B0073LHCCS 5 1374537600 25 it always gives me a great deal of enjoyment to try something new. lt makes you use your head. I love this game a lot
A121L12ID54TSX B009LFGG76 5 1373414400 31 this word search is outstanding I have enjoy puzzle like word search with them being in magazine form. But now with this one. being out on the kindle is even better
A121L12ID54TSX B009LNHMLC 5 1400976000 27 I love the way you have them set up and the ease of using these little books and will always suggest them to my friends and family.
A121RUQ122N54Y B00BR5759Q 5 1364774400 25 This game is extremely fun, and a great time waster. I love this game! I had no problem logging into Facebook to play with friends.
A121RUQ122N54Y B004Q3CJQ0 5 1325116800 20 Its a great little portable flashlight for all kinds of things! I use it on my Kindle Fire. No problems!
A121RUQ122N54Y B009UWL580 5 1353110400 23 This Pride Claw game is fantastic!  I play this game for hours upon hours just kill time. I highly recommend it to anyone.
A121RUQ122N54Y B0086700CM 5 1339372800 33 I have been waiting forever for this game to come to Amazon.  I am really glad it came. I love it. No problems at all for this game! Amazing for children and adults!
A121RUQ122N54Y B0067VKQLE 5 1325548800 24 This game is awesome! Its so addicting! I would recommend this game to any one with middle aged children who like to play games.
A121RUQ122N54Y B004T68X4Q 3 1326153600 28 I have this on my Kindle Fire and it let me play it for like five minutes then it blacked out and only allowed me to.hear the sound.
A121RUQ122N54Y B006PHD0RW 5 1329264000 28 This game is full of fun and hours of wasting time. I play this all the time with family has competition to see who could do the best.
A121RUQ122N54Y B007PW1BZY 4 1334361600 20 This is a great game ! The only the problem is you cant customize your avataror play the game online.
A121RUQ122N54Y B0088QGB7Y 5 1342656000 26 This game has its moment, but ot works great. The picture is wonderul! Also the game in general is a fun and exicted game for kids.
A121RUQ122N54Y B0058VW36U 5 1331424000 32 This game is amazing! It keep me and my brother occupied for hours upon hours. I highly recommend to any who love corny little video games or who loves to waste time.
A121RUQ122N54Y B007XKEY6Q 5 1335657600 30 I have been waiting on this game forever! It's skittle late, but it works. No problems with it at all. Very fun and entertaining. I would recommend it to friends.
A121WZNVG2RUA6 B006QC53WG 5 1351209600 29 This is a great game. It is fun and challenging and holds your interest. So far it is one of the best games I have enjoyed on my kindle.
A121WZNVG2RUA6 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1378166400 32 This is an Awesome game!! I have my whole family hooked on it. We love it they constantly upgrade it and add new features and levels. This is really a terrific game.
A121Y8KJARDYCH B0058VW36U 5 1342310400 23 it is funny awesome great app you should get it I would so anything to get this game everyone reading this get app
A121Y8KJARDYCH B007HGMVIE 1 1342310400 24 boo to this game it wicks like Justin beaber I would stick my toungh out at the creaters boo it ducks it is retarted
A121Y8KJARDYCH B00CZDSK7K 3 1399334400 73 The game is really fun the only problem I have with it is that there are no African Americans only white people that is a wrong move right there so if you fix that I would rate this a five star totally so don't download this game I'd you want top have an African-American otherwise the game is great so if you are white you should have a fun time with this game!
A121YSUYWHXY2X B00H91MUHY 1 1400371200 36 So stupid I hate it you can't do anything you can't have kid's you can't move in you can't even get married I want my $ back I would give it no star's but you can't
A121YSUYWHXY2X B00AREIAI8 5 1359158400 79 Fun, but I don't like the ads popping up like that I think that it is stupid so if you do it differently it would be a lot better, as I said fun special if you love horse's, I play it every day but really you should do something about the ads popping up because I hate that it drives me nuts you should keep them in one place and not popping up in people's faces all the time.
A1220P5YJ07YVK B00HFTHXMC 5 1395273600 39 I found another challenging game...LOVE it....the only thing i found was u have to be careful in using finger in making shots for it is very sensitive & u can end having the bubble going in a different directions.
A1220P5YJ07YVK B00G4FAU14 3 1395273600 51 It is a good game to pass the time if u enjoy playing card games. My husband tried it and choose not to continue due to it being to confusing how it worked. I use to play Poker game on my cell phone but this set up i don't care for.
A1220P5YJ07YVK B00CH26TL8 3 1395273600 27 Very challenging as you continue each level but it does not hold my interest as well as some of the other bubble games that you can purchase.
A1223HDNBAON0B B00CF6I3X8 5 1367020800 415 This game is SO MUCH FUN, and please don't be misguided, this is NOT a match 3 game.  I got this last night, and just could not put it down.  I have been playing it most of the day today already. {on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"}Okay, So,  I don't know much about it yet, but the main goal of the game, is to clear the board of the "gems" but as you do so, there is a little strategy involved...which makes you think, but it is still fun.  You just "touch/click on" a group of gems of the same style/color, and there has to be at least 3 to make them drop off the board. {I thought you had to 'swipe' across a row of gems, but NO, you just touch anywhere where a large group of the same gems are}... Where the strategy comes in, is trying to get the most of the same "gems" grouped together, then one touch anywhere on that group, and poof, they are all gone!!  But are replaced by more until the score is reached and you pass that current level. :)  You get more points by clearing more gems at a time.  It wasn't hard for me to figure it out, just play around with it, and you will soon be into it for hours before you know it.  I have already won 2 trophies and have no idea how! ha haLike one of the other reviewers, I don't like the "timed" mode, so I go for the relaxed one, {don't like the added stress}.  Each level also has special "power ups" if you should need them if you get in a tight spot and can't seem to clear off that particular corner square.  It has pleasant music, and cool "clicking" sounds as the gems fall and are replaced.  The graphics are very pretty, I think this is a very good game, I am enjoying it very much, and if you do enjoy the gem type games with a little twist, this one will be right up your alley. I have never purchased a game that has just been released, and only had one review on it, {which was on the negative side to say the least}, but I got it anyway, and  I am SO glad I did!!  I have already gotten my money's worth back in enjoyment.  I hope this makes sense, as I don't write that many reviews.  Have fun....I'm sure you will!!  :)
A1223HDNBAON0B B008JJS6D2 3 1368230400 165 I do like this game. I enjoy it in one way, because you are playing it by yourself, for example:  there's no pressure of looking up at the top and seeing the amount of winning cards left in your round, and knowing you are not gonna get a &quot;BINGO&quot;.  But on the other hand, I kind of miss it sometimes of playing LIVE, with other people. So, this Bingo game gives you that choice if you want to just chill out, and play at your leisure.  Unless I'm missing something..that's the way this one is played. It's a nice time filler. But one thing I don't like, is the numbers are displayed at the top and it goes almost too fast for me, it would be nice if there were a&quot;bingo caller&quot; voice to announce each ball that comes out. And there is no chart to refer to, to make sure you are getting all of them. (Like I've seen in the other bingo games).
A1223HDNBAON0B B00B2V66VS 2 1360195200 123 I DL'd this on Feb. 3rd on my Kindle Fire....played it for a day or two LOVED IT --- but now it crashes and won't even play anymore.  I was liking this game a lot but now I can't even get it to open. When I try -- it just goes back the home page and won't even open anymore!!  I have reported this to amazon because now I am getting all these error pop ups and they said they have passed this on to the developers.  No word yet and I would love to give this 5 stars but I can't right now...they need to see it is having issues.  once it's fixed I'll come back and make a better review.  =)
A1223HDNBAON0B B006AZZPCM 1 1388102400 92 I have the Kindle Fire 8.9 tablet and I was using this app quite a bit and loving it...HOWEVER....since the latest update, it will no longer download...AT ALL!! The green arrow is there, but I press it and it does absolutely nothing! I have tried the troubleshooting, but still cannot get it to work. I have been reading reviews from others and see that I am not alone in this.PLEASE FIX!!!  Because I sure can't use it now! Will probably be uninstalling this until there is a fix.  Grrrr!! Very Frustrated.  :(
A1223HDNBAON0B B00529IOXO 1 1358208000 106 I got  a very vulgar &amp; upsetting text-- so I contacted the developers and they were so unwilling to help me--they were very rude and basically told me it was just too bad. They didn't even apoligize that this had happened!! Actually I felt slapped in the face by these developers and will be uninstalling this app.  because due to the fact that the developers refuse to remove  this haunting scary text and I see it every time I open the app. which is very sad :-(  They made me feel that I deserved what this MONSTER sent to me in that text!! SHAME ON YOU!!
A1223HDNBAON0B B00CWY76CC 5 1389398400 85 Playing this on my Kindle 8.9&quot; HD....what an awesome game! I have the best feeling of excitement and accomplishment, just after completing the first few levels. I've read that the levels get a little harder as you go...but I love a challenge. It is a bit different than I thought it would be...going in, I thought it would more or less have a back story to it, but it is just simply trying to get out of the rooms you're in. I would recommend this.
A1223HDNBAON0B B00BQPEIT2 5 1364169600 106 I love this game. And I have to first mention, that it is not just for kids...lol. I am 40(something) and this is my new fav. game!! I was even surprised to make it to the dark forest!  Actually travelling there the very first time really freaked me out with the amazing graphics, I didn`t know what was gonna happen!  The balloon ride is way cool as well.  Disney has done an excellent job with this game the picture/graphics is just gorgeous! Can`t wait for more places to travel to in the game.  If you like ANY of the Temple Run games~~you will LOVE this one!
A1223HDNBAON0B B00HFTHXMC 4 1388534400 58 This is a great game, and I would have given it five (5) stars but I cannot seem to get it to link to my FB account. The one on my mobile device links to FB just fine, but not on the Kindle. (strange).PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS PROBLEM.....I AM SEEING NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS.Otherwise, a very enjoyable game!!!
A12249RQPSHCRG B004JZBGWI 5 1354838400 25 My needs are few as far as planners go.  This app is perfect for the shopping lists, checklists, and occasional calendar entries that I need.
A12249RQPSHCRG B004S8L4MI 5 1355961600 42 What a fun app!  Four fantastic games, incredibly realistic physics and sound.  Works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire. And even though it's ad-supported, I hardly ever see an ad pop up.  One of the best app choices I've made for my Kindle.
A12249RQPSHCRG B009EEFTMC 5 1360886400 28 This game is sick! It's like mah jongg on acid, floating in space. Totally enjoyable. Super simple, crazy fun. Worth at least ten times the price I paid.
A12249RQPSHCRG B0094J0J18 4 1367712000 39 Not really, of course. It gets pretty tough pretty quickly, but it's a great stress reliever if you're needing some violence. Hard to build up the in-game money needed to upgrade your gear, but I can live with it.
A1224W7AK4K6JH B005V1N71W 5 1391212800 35 You hear only the music you like, thumbs down and you never hear that song again. It's great, but I bet it won't be free for long. No commercials either, that is a huge plus!
A1224W7AK4K6JH B0063GORYU 3 1388188800 32 The game freezes to much or won`t load at all. I have to turn off the kindle and reboot to get to work a few mins. bre it starts to freeze again
A1224W7AK4K6JH B007TXN4TK 4 1355529600 25 This game is fun for both young and old. I always wanted to play the piano, this is as close as I'll ever come lol
A1224W7AK4K6JH B007N9FKCY 2 1361836800 27 I can certainly live without this game. My grandkids might enjoy it, I'll have to run it by them. Would difinitely not go out and buy it.
A1225AN999UZCG B00992CF6W 5 1360627200 20 This my favourite game ever I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys fun Best game ever ........ ,,,,,, .......
A1225AN999UZCG B00FHYX6O6 4 1381622400 27 I've played this on pc many time I have trillions of cookies this is faster tapping for me but wish it was a bit more like pc.
A1226FPBX3W3KL B008D2QRAO 5 1340496000 22 Lots of fun so far.  First level went pretty fast.  Graphics pretty good for a free game.  Easy to get free coins.
A1226FPBX3W3KL B00E5GJ7QS 4 1384646400 24 So far so good, haven't had any glitch problems.  Glad there is no chat.  Only on level three, but I will definitely keep playing.
A1226FPBX3W3KL B0091REZMW 4 1377561600 32 Fun game.  I have been playing for 9 months now and I haven't paid any money to play.  Can be a bit glitchy.  Have patience with game and you might enjoy it.
A1226FPBX3W3KL B009KS4XRO 5 1389916800 26 I like this game a lot.  Bingo and slots in one game, what a great idea.  Lots of nice people to talk with and trade with.
A1228LDYX3QLJ0 B00AKEMHCA 5 1386460800 32 I liked this game on the computer, and when it was free, I had to get it! Turns out, it's better on the Kindle Fire than on the computer. Get this game!
A1228LDYX3QLJ0 B00ET56Y48 4 1381622400 25 I would have gave this game 5 stars, but it won't let me watch videos to get free stuff in the game. Fix this please.
A1228LDYX3QLJ0 B008LG021M 5 1357516800 23 This game is perfect for people who like shooting and racing. This game combines both of that together!I LIKE this game so much!!!
A122A06SBVIWB7 B00GRPD0J0 5 1405641600 24 It is free and it is fun it has youtube vidios to heath every day and it sends fast it also has no adds

A122IR4KF5LQXQ B008K6GKW8 5 1360972800 27 Very addictive game, but be warned, it is a little harder than it appears!  But even though it is a little hard, it is really really fun!!!

A122IR4KF5LQXQ B0064X7B4A 5 1362787200 65 I would always wonder what the big deal was about this game, now I know!  Even when I am getting my butt kicked in a game, I can't stop playing!  I usually have anywhere between 10 &amp; 12 games going at the same time. If you like word games and haven't played this yet, get it!  Don't wait about minute and you will be hooked!
A122IR4KF5LQXQ B00AAX68HG 5 1357257600 29 I just love this game. my 6 year old son and I play it all the time. the little pudding dudes are just too cute. you will be hooked!
A122IR4KF5LQXQ B0079PXROU 5 1341187200 23 great app for free. shows how much life is left &amp;&amp; when it is charging &amp; how much time it takes to charge.
A122IR4KF5LQXQ B0071PARPA 1 1368316800 25 Don't really like this, not really worth it, it draws funky. Don't bother getting this app.  Unless it is free, it is not worth it.
A122KZV8ICUT95 B009HKL4B8 5 1362873600 31 This is one of the best games I've played. It's so fun to play and very awesome! I wish everyone could play this game because I know many would enjoy it!
A122OZYGGCPN4V B00AAX68HG 5 1372896000 35 Love this free app. I was addicted quickly & so is my 5 y/o. I'm glad it is a multi-generation,fun family game. We are up grading to the ad-free version as soon as we can.
A122OZYGGCPN4V B00AKL1XPU 5 1398988800 33 Great graphics. FUN to play. Keeps the kids occupied, HAPPY and out of the way for a bit. Very addicting. So glad I got this &amp; I love to play it as well.
A122OZYGGCPN4V B009G9KFQ0 5 1369094400 23 Love this app. Have it on all my electronics. Would love to have it on my cell, but my cell doesn't support it.
A122OZYGGCPN4V B00FIW5BZE 5 1391817600 21 Great graphics. LOVE that I can change the tiles and backgrounds. Even got my 6 year old daughter interested in playing.
A122OZYGGCPN4V B00BWBHIUG 5 1371859200 21 My kids (1&5) love watching this. My 5 y/o is able to play it & loves the animation & beautiful colors.
A122OZYGGCPN4V B00BJRH6HS 5 1371081600 48 I bought this on a whim because I like brain games. My BF has already taken it to play and my 5 year old thinks its fun. It does take a few minutes to get the hang of, but I think it is definitely worth those few minutes.
A122P4FOBEBGJA B0052AZJV8 1 1375315200 35 This is the worst app I have ever downloaded and I was super happy when I decided to delete it you MUST have a phone number and email this app is bad do not download
A122PEO3HT4BTP B00992CF6W 5 1372550400 22 I'm not able to get on my kindle fire its stupid it sayings there's an error when I try to download it
A122PEO3HT4BTP B008CFVG58 4 1351382400 22 its. awesome I love it. its pretty cool. but I think its a four star game I think people should get it
A122PEO3HT4BTP B00846GKTW 3 1354060800 20 its awesome I beat all the models but the new season haven't come out ive been waiting a year now
A122QJI8DT6G5K B00BS3UFCQ 5 1370736000 21 Guess the movie is super awesome. My kids play it all the time and think it is a very fun game!
A122QJI8DT6G5K B0088QGB7Y 5 1352678400 20 dear whoever I Luv Luv Luv this smurf game. Except the only problem is sometimes the words get X's out:)
A122QJI8DT6G5K B009UX2YAC 5 1361145600 33 Subway surfed is the best game EVER! I hope that everyone has a chance to get the game. This game is positively awesome. What is weird is that it's kinds like temple run.
A122QJI8DT6G5K B004MC8CA2 5 1331078400 33 liv this app so much!it is so portable you can take it to church or do a devotion on it too. u can do so much with it look up verses or anything.
A122QJI8DT6G5K B007JYI4SU 2 1334188800 20 the mood scanner doesn't really tell your mood it just tells you a mood this is a piece of junk.
A122QJI8DT6G5K B006ON41FC 5 1329782400 47 I absolutely love this app that I just really want more from this person who designed going nuts. it is the best app I've ever had.@ first it was a really hard app but then it just got adicting and I got better and loved this game.
A122QJI8DT6G5K B008Y7SMQU 5 1370822400 21 logo quiz is so awesome! I live it sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. People please please get this app it is so awesome!!!!!! ;););)););););)););););););););)
A122SX9M2KSKHJ B0085N9I84 3 1343001600 60 This app was awesome before the last update which included &quot;love potions&quot;. This update was the worst move ever by Kiwi Inc. In order to breed shell monsters you must use love potions, but it seems as if you can only acquire them by using actual money. Talk about DUMB! Kiwi has to make a new update without love potions.
A122SX9M2KSKHJ B008O7EOEE 5 1349136000 22 Have a little fun guys. Stop talking about our society and just play the game. It doesn't look disgusting, it looks funny.
A122SX9M2KSKHJ B008B0S0XK 2 1340755200 26 Game is awesome when you can play it. But everytime I play it crashes! Can the creator please fix the game with an update or something?
A122SX9M2KSKHJ B0086700CM 3 1343001600 32 This game lags on my kindle fire and it is not nearly as sensitive as it is on our ipad. I enjoy the game during the few times it actually works, though.
A122SYSEQO1Y9U B00529IOXO 3 1346630400 30 I did not get this app. yet but can some one tell me if you can text some one who does not have this appPs I have a kindle fire
A122SYSEQO1Y9U B005AJ6ISO 5 1345680000 21 great app for Christians. gives me a great attitude. all those who rate it one star I'll be praying for you;)
A122TWEM8AXIQN B0050D6PH4 1 1306195200 39 No surprise this one made it to FAD considering how worthless it is. just another puzzle popper game clone like the millions out there. Only difference is you paid $2.99 for this. Hey, at least it's free for today.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004ZFK600 1 1306195200 26 two words: unlimited text messaging. besides there is google voice. this app is just pointless. not to mention that you need a separate number as well.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B007TML2EK 1 1343865600 32 Tablet space is not fully utilized especially on the Galaxy Tab 10.1 and Motorola Xoom. It also doesn't take advantage of the HD screen on the Nexus 7. Please, fix these issues.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B0052UZIFA 5 1306800000 77 One of the best games I have ever played on Android and that's saying a lot considering that there aren't many. Very colorful and smooth graphics. The music is also charming and accents the gameplay very well. However, it is the gameplay that will keep you hooked. Beating endless waves of zombies with plants has never been more fun. Hopefully, the dev adds more levels, modes and designs as the game goes on. 5 out 5.T-Mobile G2.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004W89LGU 3 1307318400 26 gets boring fast. probably be fun during long waits and what not. :/ 20 word limit. blah. blah. blah. 20 word limit again. blah. blah. blah.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004SYP5WC 5 1331510400 24 Some funny a s s reviews at the bottom. lol. Anyway, great app and would highly recommend it to those that need help remembering
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004V4S4MW 1 1310169600 41 This has to be the lowest of the low of any FAotD that Amazon has offered. I mean, you can get this same functionality in your built in Google Calendars. you certainly don't need a separate app or widget for that.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004NELBPC 1 1332460800 103 I like to consider myself a moderate. Socially liberal and fiscally conservative. I used to like Huff Po but after a while I grew weary of the obvious bias in all their articles and anaysis. It's no worse than FOX News which is equally as bias if not more. The only difference is that one is a biased right wing propaganda machine and the other is a biased left wing propaganda machine. Either way, they're both pushing an agenda.If you're looking for objective articles dealing with actual facts, figures and covering news from all the angles, keep looking. You won't find it here.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004T5RDBG 2 1306972800 129 It does kill apps however, like many reviewers before me have said, I don't think task killers are good for your phone. If you have Android 2.1 or higher, the OS already has a built in task killer to kill unwanted apps running in the background. Simply go to settings - applications - manage applications, select the app and click &quot;Force Close&quot;. No need for an extra app to do that.It's also rather ironic that this app claims to help your battery life when it's actually the other way round. Task Killers run in the background constantly using up battery life and processing power. You will most likely notice a significant drop in time between charges upon installing this app. This one gets a 2 out of 5.T-Mobile G2.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B00685VI98 2 1322179200 21 It should not need access to retrieve running applications. That's just borderline creepy. Too bad. Seemed like a good game too.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004XNGKBS 2 1327104000 82 This is good for making shopping lists, quick notes or personalized memos and letters. However, the finger detection isn't very good. You'll often find yourself  deleting words because letters get cut off very often. Your &quot;O&quot; turns out to be a &quot;U&quot;. That sort of thing. Maybe if I had a stylus it would work better, I don't know. Finally, the tutorial is also quite difficult to understand and the UI needs a bit of improvement to make the whole app accessible.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B007375V4I 1 1340496000 21 5 star reviews are from the developer. App is pure garbage and an absolute memory hog. Permissions ate very shady too.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B004VFJMYK 3 1306627200 75 I run quite a bit and have been looking for an app to help me out with cardio. I will give this a go during my morning jog. Looking at it though, I have to say that it's quite expensive for the minimal features it provides. At least it's free for today thanks to Amazon. It should also be mentioned that you will need the free version of this app for this one to work.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B005AKPLYK 3 1309996800 34 dont get all the hype. looks like every other tower defense game out there. dungeon defenders is better, imo. at least you get to participate in the action. 3 out of 5. T-Mobile G2.
A122TWEM8AXIQN B006MYTHH0 1 1328140800 77 This is just your basic tic tac toe in a glowy format. Nothing more, nothing less. You think, well, at least the AI will be challenging on difficult levels. Nope. He's still just as stupid as the easy levels. I beat it over and over with the same tricks. It's ridiculous how it just plays in the same format or even tries to adjust. Overall, this thing wasn't even worth the price of FREE. It's that bad...
A122VZH3859I6V B008NCUFYS 5 1357689600 31 Very nice game.  My grandson plays with it and it is a very safe game for young children.  I really like this one for him and will recommended to other children.
A122VZH3859I6V B009HQ9UHC 5 1365724800 20 Children learn about problem solving and strategies with this game. May choices to try and try again We love it!!!!
A122W02VYTEUYK B006LPF1VG 3 1385769600 24 I got the app. I couldn't make him barf. When I finally did it sain,&quot;try again?&quot; So what is the point of the game?
A122W02VYTEUYK B00CAK052Q 4 1372723200 23 It was a pretty good game overall could use better graphics and vehicles but still was a good games I would recommend it
A122W02VYTEUYK B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392508800 23 It's exactly like floppy bird but better. You can have different birds. I love it. But the weird thing is the bird poops
A122W02VYTEUYK B00IZJLRQE 4 1405382400 72 Ok now in these, I don't know, last four months flappy... apps have been coming out. This app is probably over ruling almost every other flappy app. It is great, although one time I wanted to change my skin but it was to complicated to rate on the Amazon store. So I rated here it didn't work don't try it, (the rating). One last thing everybody is asking, YES, IT IS ADDICTIVE.
A122W02VYTEUYK B00IZLM8MY 3 1401753600 70 So, my sister and I both wanted this game and I had already had lots of progress on it. So when my sister got the app the apps like both combined. It now doesn't work I was so upset and mad.every time.e I click  on it it loads then  it says problem with loading try again.and  I never deleted it don't get it unless you want your heart broken. :'-(

A1233L74LHPA06 B00EN9KDNS 5 1383868800 171 What a wonderful (and FREE) app!  I downloaded the free version to my Android phone just to see what it was about.  The music and animation graphics are just too cute.  When you begin, the piano has to be put together, like a puzzle, in order to play it.  It's a simple game of matching the shapes until all of the pieces are in place.  Then it's ready to play!  I had my 4 year-old niece with me when I was getting my oil changed and she started getting restless, so I pulled up the app and she was mesmerized immediately.  Even on the phone version, the piano keys were just the right size for her little fingers.  There is a feature that will teach your child how to play simple songs by highlighting which keys to play.  The voice of the narration is pleasant and encouraging.  My niece wouldn't give me my phone back when we left the oil change place--she played it all the way home in the car!
A1233L74LHPA06 B00DSM7J2E 5 1383955200 117 We got this game for my niece because my nephew has the similar fire truck game from 22learn.  In my opinion, this one is more fun!  This one is more fun for a girl, but appeals to boys as well.  The ice cream theme is novel and the games are a great teaching tool.  My niece loves slinging ice cream with a sling shot!  She doesn't seem as interested in the parts of the truck.  I think her favorite by far is the cupcake shop, where she makes the cupcakes as ordered, counts the money, and finally gets to 'eat' the cupcake.  The game even reminded her to throw away her cupcake wrapper in the recycle bin!
A1235F1613KMAJ B009ZZGX98 5 1357430400 30 Love playing mahjong, and this has many styles and settings from easy to difficult. It is nice on the Kindle, cause it is portable. One can play just about anywhere.
A12371VCYL2R4U B00CF354UG 5 1402185600 55 I've been amazed at how well this works on my phone.  I've got a note three and is almost as good as if I was playing it on a console.  With the hacker's keyboard you can even use the cheats.  Well worth the money if you need to kill time or just love the game.
A12371VCYL2R4U B004UNGZ8Y 1 1313280000 21 Wouldn&apos;t touch this app with a 10 foot pole with the dev stating it defrags your phone.  What?  Defrag an android?
A123C2R3FHF1C3 B00AE3J7PM 1 1396051200 40 If you like marking buttons to light up get this but if you don't want space taken up then don't it just looks cool on the screen shots and I think that the other two reviews are from the maker
A123F0BNNJMBBX B00BPC23XO 4 1364342400 21 This is a game to play when you are bored and don't have nothing to do and it is very challenging!!!!
A123F0BNNJMBBX B00BG3ID0Y 5 1364342400 25 This is a really good game you need to get it know!!!!!! I think some are challenging but it is good to try something new!!!
A123F0BNNJMBBX B005ZFOOE8 5 1396569600 22 Thiis Is A Greaat Raadiio Staation Thaat Allows U Too Listeen Too Greaat Music Selections And Your Favoritee Artists Of Your Choicee!
A123F0BNNJMBBX B00BHHIWQO 4 1372896000 21 This is a really good and fast game!!! It is challenging in the amount of seconds..... like 60 secs. to finish.
A123F0BNNJMBBX B00BNH1PF8 5 1365379200 25 This is a great game it is very challenging though!!! You have to look at the pictures carefully, because they would try to trick you!!
A123FB7YIOWH01 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392076800 40 I like the app flapping wings because it is more of a challenge than the real flapping bird. Even though the title if the game says it's not flappy bird it's is basically the same as the real flapping bird
A123FB7YIOWH01 B00GUY712U 5 1387756800 22 I like this app because it is cool how the egg hatches into something that it dreams about when it is sleeping.
A123FB7YIOWH01 B00DJFIMW6 5 1379376000 23 I really love minion rush because it it entertaining and fun it. I rate this app very good. Thank you for this app.
A123GAIKPJ98OQ B0064T6LV8 4 1323216000 24 Surprised by negative comments. Ads about what you'd expect in a free app. Not too intrusive. Flawless on the Kindle Fire. It's just FUN!!!
A123GAIKPJ98OQ B00G5LQ5MU 1 1400803200 25 its not really free you can play the first part that lasts for about two minutes for free then you have to pay it sucks
A123GAIKPJ98OQ B004KU2JZU 5 1323302400 100 The movements and gestures took a few games to get used to; however, once you're familiar with it, it is fantastic. The app runs flawlessly on the Kindle Fire. I have not had a single issue. What I do have is a LARGE assortment of games I can play. When I downloaded, I thought it was a simple solitaire game. It is LOTS of games in one app. I'm definitely purchasing the Mega Pack once I learn all the games in this free pack. This has become a &quot;must have&quot; and stays out of the cloud and on my device.
A123GAIKPJ98OQ B004SD5GZ4 2 1323302400 69 This app does give you the ability to view. Pdt files. It doesn't do it well. Documents are free floating, movable in all directions making the document difficult to navigate and read. I purchased QuickDocs Pro, primarily for the word processor and spreadsheet. I noticed it had a .Pdt reader, opened a document with it on a whem, now I'm uninstalling Adobe Reader. I can not recommend this app.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B006H7TC3Q 1 1337817600 31 There is no back button as far I can tell.  You make an adjustment and when you hit &quot;back&quot;,  the app closes.  I find this app extremely irritating and useless.  Uninstalled.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B004XDYJRU 5 1361318400 43 There is a plethora of good, old-school country stations on TuneIn.  It is disappointing to see that your favorite radio station has the same playlist as every other station in the same genre due to the network.  Kind of like Clear Channel Radio.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B00A4KVFLY 1 1361145600 34 Not logging in with Facebook and sharing all of your info with the developer will &quot;limit your gameplay experience&quot;.  That's all I had to see, never played, uninstalled.  Kiss my hairy white ass devs.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B004GJDQT8 5 1361318400 20 I use this app waaaaaay too much, you can ask my wife if you don't believe me.  God bless America.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B00GT67UUM 5 1397001600 32 I got this game as free app of the day, but I would buy it.  It's great for guys like me who are mechanically inclined.  I'd say it's mostly a man's game.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B0067R0APK 2 1374105600 24 But not the best either.  I thought that after the latest update the RADAR map would function properly, but I guess I thought wrong.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B005K9V776 1 1323388800 22 I wasted 3 minutes of my life on this game.  I'll never get those 3 minutes back, and that is soooooooo depressing.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B0087SGWI6 5 1361318400 35 Very entertaining and challenging.  I played for a while and my co-worker had to buy it too.  He was very disappointed to find out that he was far less intelligent than me.  Tee hee hee.
A123OGWBI8VY0H B007TKT2SK 5 1369094400 20 This app devours fractions like nobody's business.  If you need to work with complicated fractions, this app is for you!
A123OGWBI8VY0H B0087FMUCQ 4 1397001600 31 Very entertaining and addictive game.  I got it as free app of the day, I'm not sure I'd buy it but that's only because I'm not into this type of game.
A123PSO9MJG70I B004QJKRZ4 1 1326499200 23 you can not get into the stupid app! Fcc gvgg ghgg gggvv gghhgg gghyg gggfg fggff rcf cvhg. fvvev f cf v.  vvv
A123PSO9MJG70I B0057J06HQ 5 1325289600 24 Office jerk is hilarious! its funny when you watch his face turn red. I was just going through free apps and I found it
A123PSO9MJG70I B008NCUFYS 5 1349481600 21 Every day when I'm chilling watching Tv I play this super addicting game! it is so fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is also addicting
A123PSO9MJG70I B008Y2FRFO 5 1348617600 20 this game is like my life! It is amazingly awesome!!! you try to get these cool bonuses!! it is awesome!
A123PSO9MJG70I B009HKL4B8 1 1349481600 25 This app makes you wait hours to play because of the stupid &quot;downloading 1050 MB&quot; BLAH BLAH BLAH. I didn't even get into the game
A123RD51Z3KWI5 B00DWZ3S90 5 1397865600 22 This is a very fun game. No hassles no pressure. Just a test of your matching skills. Good exercise for your brain.
A123RD51Z3KWI5 B008Y7SMQU 5 1369180800 24 I am really enjoying this game.  It has been many years since I have seen some of these logos but I still remember them.
A123RD51Z3KWI5 B006P0A5KO 5 1350950400 29 This game is fun, charming, and mind teasing.  I have really enjoyed the different characters in the game. It is a good way to challenge my mind and win.
A123RD51Z3KWI5 B00APKROYK 5 1361664000 43 Word Games Bundle Pack is a good mental challenge in several packages.  If you love to tease your brain and build your memory stamina then this is a good place to do it.  You won't get bored, there are many choices to make.
A123RD51Z3KWI5 B00E8KLWB4 5 1394323200 27 I absolutely love this game. It is very ent&ecirc;rtaining and challenging all at the same time. Th&eacute; Hidden puzzles are changed often enough you never get bored.
A123RD51Z3KWI5 B0091REZMW 5 1392249600 25 New game day 1.  Looks like this is going to be &agrave; fun game.  I am looking forward to many hours oh playing this game.
A123S7R43KXW1D B004DLNC4I 5 1358380800 27 I love this app. I get to hear what is going on all around town. This is an amazing free app. I haven't had any issues yet!
A123S7R43KXW1D B00A4KVFLY 3 1359158400 48 This is a fun game but it keeps asking me to connect to Facebook and I don't have Facebook. I wish I could bypass this. The keyboard runs very slow some times and you some times get the same questions. But over all this is a fun game.
A123S7R43KXW1D B00AIQP9DE 4 1357344000 22 Good game over all. There are many different mini games which were fun to do. A fun game to pass some time.
A123S7R43KXW1D B00A77II0U 4 1357948800 21 The game is fun with a good storyline. Fun mini games that take some thinking. A good game in my opinion.
A123S7R43KXW1D B00AKJRPC2 5 1360022400 33 I enjoyed this game. The strategy guide was easy to access and easy to use. I also enjoyed the storyline. There was plenty of game play and the graphics were great as well.
A123S7R43KXW1D B00FAPF5U0 5 1384128000 54 Who would have thought a game could be so addictive. I play until I have no lives left and then I turn on the notification on to let me know when more lives are available. I recommend this game, but I do want to warn you, you won't be able to put it down.
A123S7R43KXW1D B00A6S051A 3 1376352000 26 This app is pretty cool. There are some fun stamps. You can add background colors, rotate the pictures. I continue to use this app. Would recommend.
A123S7R43KXW1D B00G5LQ5MU 4 1402012800 20 I Enjoyed this game. One of my top 5 favs. I would recommend this game to any one and everyone.
A123S7R43KXW1D B008IJT0CE 5 1357862400 32 I love this app. It helps me relax no matter what mood I am in. I fall a sleep to most night's. I would recommend this to any one. It's so peaceful.
A123S7R43KXW1D B009XAJI8S 3 1358294400 34 I love this app when it works. Channels seem to go &quot;offline&quot;  too much. It is free so I shouldn't expect too much but this app seems to work only when it wants to.
A123S7R43KXW1D B008JJS6D2 3 1362873600 25 I wish the game board was a little larger when you play four cards but this is fun. I play this a lot when board
A123YFGY64MN4E B009ZZDNT6 5 1357516800 26 overall great for using it just for the time but if you want to change the way the time image is, buy the add free version
A123YFGY64MN4E B006QYWIO0 4 1357516800 20 some of the windows i.e. bill pay would not open or allow a bill to be paid, thorugh the app
A123YFGY64MN4E B00632HWOG 5 1357516800 23 perfect! does not stall and gives alerts when you get new mail! love this app! you can access it from any wi-fi network!
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B004H2MGOU 5 1375142400 120 I downloaded this one, because of the star rating. Hm, lol anyway, it really was my first choice, but I chose the glow tic tac toe game because of my six year old niece had the glow one, and, well I just was a copy catter. :-) However, I really wanted this one. I like this one because it reminds me of playing around on the black board in my old childhood days in school. I also like the audience cheering you on when you win or lose sound, compared to the glow tic tac toe game, which doesn't say anything but the plunk sound of the ex and Os, boring! This one makes me smile when I lose :-)
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B00CPOT3ZM 4 1371859200 129 At first, I didn't like the game, it was boring, but when I chose a little boy to work on, and finished with the little boy's teeth, I was able to take a picture of him with a big smile of his clean teeth. In the corner of the end of the page, I saw an email button. I emailed it to myself first, from my kindle fire HD LOL It was so cool to see a picture of the finished product. It didn't seem so boring to me after that anymore. I can upload the picture as a profile pic on my facebook page, or any other social media. I think I'll keep the game for a while :-) You can save the picture as jpeg, or png.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B0055DL1G4 1 1388188800 21 Too much information, and not enough entertainment. It wasn't what I expected at all. It was just so confusing to me.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B004SJIEXY 5 1388188800 83 I downloaded the free one at first, and I ended up downloading this one. It's always better to get the games you have to pay for, because the free ones, you end of having to pay in the long run anyway. I played one fast game on the free game, and I ended up having to get the paying game anyway to keep playing; it was worth it because this is a fun match 3 game, I really like it and recommend it.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B0079Q963K 1 1388188800 50 If you have a regular cable xfinity, broadband, comcast network, this will not work. So, don't bother downloading it.I thought maybe it will override and work, nope. First off, it asked for optimum username and password. I thought, &#34;Duh&#34; LOL  okay, time to uninstall. I was happy it was free.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B00IKZX1ZI 3 1402012800 36 It's a bit quiet, not too much of a noise maker. If you're some place like a hospital, or church, this'll be a good match 3 game to play to kill time. It's got nice graphics.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B00BJCLUXO 2 1385683200 38 Well, I'm a bit unsure about this. It's a bit off in making the drawings it suggest to draw; for that reason I don't like it. I may play with it just to kill time, but that's it.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B004IALZTS 4 1358985600 100 If you like passing the time, waiting for your car to be serviced, or to see a doctor, or just waiting on a bus at a bus stop, this is the game to download and play. What the heck, it's only free! It's as easy as shooting a basketball in hoops, but it's a bit tricky. It's got a desk fan to blow the paper away from the trash can, in another direction; it can land on someone in an office and you can hear them scold you. It's a cute game and I recommend it for teens and adults.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B007F1SLC6 3 1357948800 96 I liked this game at first; I hardly ever play the game now. The problem I had was when you're on the road, and you bang into a guardrail, or the side of the road ditch, and the only way to get back on the road, or out of the ditch, whether going the wrong way or the right way, you have to keep turning the wheel while giving it gas; like turning out of the stuck position. There is no back up button. Other than that, the graphics are great and the sound is awesome.
A123Z3NWDM3TTG B00BJ9VBLI 1 1371772800 133 I think it's just not my day. I downloaded this game on my kindle fire today, and it just freezes up on me. I got as far as typing my name in, that was it. I've played the game before in the past on my desk top. It was a wild tangent pop game I think. It was so much fun to play. I like breaking the chains, and the graphics, and the sound effects, bubbles popping sounds awesome. However the one star is just the experience that I am having with the free game, that I've downloaded on my kindle is all. I'm day having a bad day. :-( I just may turn back to my desk top and play games on it for a while, and give the kindle a rest.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00A8ECU24 5 1392854400 22 I love this game.  I have spent hours on it without even realizing it.  Definately addicting.  I would recommend it to anyone.
A123ZF409L23TQ B008MAGJTQ 5 1402099200 26 I played this game for a while then gave up.  When I revisited it later it was quite good the farther that you got into it.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00IS87HYI 3 1402099200 27 this game i saw on tv and decided to chekc=============== it out.  It is cute and a bit fun.  It takes a bit getting used to though.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00FAPF5U0 4 1402099200 25 it is addictive however after a while it grows to be repetitive.  I love these kinds of games but the tutorials get on my nerves.
A123ZF409L23TQ B004I125GO 5 1402099200 43 this app is great it can link you directly to the theater that is near you and i like how the menu is laid out now.  It is much easier to read and you can use it to purchase tickets right from it.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00CH26TL8 4 1402099200 35 I like it however I gave up on level 37 thinking that this was all that there was.  I was wrong my mother has been playing for six months and is up to level 70.
A123ZF409L23TQ B0066T0BTO 4 1402099200 27 i have this game on my computer and I enjoy it however I do wish that there were more options to choose from than just the three.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00IKZX1ZI 5 1402099200 28 this game is challenging, cute, and fun.  I play it from time to time.  It can get hard the farther you go which makes it fun and challenging.
A123ZF409L23TQ B009HUB40Y 3 1402099200 25 I like these games and this one is alright.  It is fast paced however there are so many like this I can't stick with one.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00BJ9VBLI 4 1402099200 24 very fun like that you can get powerups to get rid of chains easy as well as build this little city within a tree.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00ABGEFWC 5 1391558400 28 I love this game.  It has a lot of great updates.  You can get hats andjewellery for your pets.  It does have a bit of a lagging issue.
A123ZF409L23TQ B00HJ30F1U 3 1402099200 20 I like how the graphics are.  These little birds are so cute and they make noises when you shoot them.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B008IJTFYW 5 1343952000 34 What a great app! Very easy to use and the sound selection is wonderful. Being able to layer the sounds, control the volume and set the duration of the app is terrific. Well done!
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B00820STKI 5 1338854400 22 Nice graphics. Fun to tap along with notes to classical music. My daughter tapped all the way through Beethoven's Ode to Joy.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B0071PS7AC 5 1330992000 25 This is a fun game to play. The graphics are clear and sharp and it moves along at a nice pace. Played on Kindle Fire.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B004UT6RE0 5 1363996800 21 I have added this app to every device in my household. Everything you need all in one convenient place. Highly recommend.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B009HHX414 4 1357689600 83 This is a great testing app. There seems to be a delay in getting replies to my texts. I have to close the app and reopen it to see new messages. I've had no trouble adding contacts. The only thing I cannot figure out how to do is to receive some sort of alert when I get a text message. Unless I open my Kindle Fire and go to the app, I see no other way to know if I have a text.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B008Y7SMQU 4 1347926400 32 Logo Quiz Fun Plus Free is a fun app. It's a bit more challenging than I would expect. Make sure you know the exact spelling of the word you are keying in.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B00881VLCE 5 1339459200 24 This app works nicely on the Kindle Fire. No issues dragging the puzzle pieces into place either with finger tip or microfiber tip stylus.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B0064X7B4A 4 1363478400 45 Words With Friends is the same fun game as on the PC with the exception of not having the option to pay for an ad free version. Even if you have the paid, ad free version on your computer, you cannot get it here yet.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B007XKEZ7O 3 1337990400 41 I just purchased this game and after two days of play the game will no longer load. It prompts you to log in through Facebook or email and then it just attempts to load but does not connect to the game.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B008XG1X18 5 1345161600 29 Finally,  the REAL Pinterest app. It works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire. The layout is beautiful and the images are crisp and clear. Very easy to navigate. Love it!
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B005J80RTW 5 1330300800 23 Word Hero is fun and challenging whether you're looking to play for just a couple minutes or for an extended period of time.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B00DUGCLY4 3 1404259200 36 This game's pictures range from easy to ones that almost make sense to there's no way anyone could guess without using or buying points for more hints.Room for improvement but then again it's a free app.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B006VW94HQ 5 1342828800 21 This game is fun. It a word matching/ word association game makes you think and is entertaining at the same time.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B00BGC5UAG 4 1361836800 27 A good way to pass the time. Something that requires a little thought but not too time consuming. Play as much or as little as you want.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B00EBQRSTK 4 1376870400 21 This is a fun app. The rating request occurs a bit too early for me to give a completely fair rating.
A1240KB0FNW6I2 B008JK6W5K 4 1344038400 53 I enjoy this game. It's a fun way to pass the time if you have a few minutes of free time. Depending where in the world you live there will be logos you've never seen before but in a pinch you can Google logos and find some of the ones that stump you.
A12438HLIWHHD4 B007NZV2HK 3 1393286400 101 I just got my first &#34;smart phone&#34; and still discovering everything you can do AND I love word search books.  I thought how cool this is going to be to have it on the phone. Maybe I just don't have the touch screen down yet but I found it very difficult to get the lines straight and going where I wanted them.  I found it's much easier with a pencil and paper and uninstalled it as soon as I finished the first puzzle.  If you can control touch screen you'll probably love this.  I'm sad that it didn't work for me.
A1245WU35KVV2 B0067VKQLE 3 1369699200 23 It's okay, my 5 yr old says he likes it.  The boys say that it's too hard when you get to level 2
A1245WU35KVV2 B0094BB4TW 5 1369699200 24 Convenient and almost surprised this doesn't automaticaly come with most devices.  Can't imagine spending money for social media and glad we have these apps
A1245WU35KVV2 B00AM1RL4A 5 1369699200 22 Fun and once you unlock new bikes, it gets better, according to my 5 and 7 yr old boys.  Free, free :)
A1246XCWDA4ECQ B0055SWM08 5 1320278400 20 it's original, fun, challenging, and just well made. pay the buck and support a great game maker. three more words
A1246XCWDA4ECQ B00CA3C1N4 4 1374451200 68 This is a fun entry into the genre, with appealing graphics and sound.  It starts up somewhat easy, which is good because the learning curve is steeper than expected. After you get the hang of the basics, you'll find yourself winning pretty easily.  But increasing the difficulty even one notch changes things dramatically!  I am currently getting my butt beat playing on normal, back to easy for me!
A1246XCWDA4ECQ B00AECDDYY 5 1402531200 23 Its a basic concept, send your ships and upgrade your cities, but varying maps and adjustable difficulty keep you coming back for more!
A1249XBHMW5DSN B006OCM13M 4 1339977600 25 it is an awesome game u can make so many dishes and design ur own bakery I recomend it for people who like strategy games

A1249XBHMW5DSN B0064X7B4A 4 1333584000 28 when I got on today it kept asking me ti update and I just wanted to play but it was annoying but I still gave it a 4

A124CQZRMNS896 B008GWPEQ4 5 1374019200 79 It a really fun game if u like team managing games (which I do) if your looking for a real b-ball game this is not it. But you should at least try this game because when you start playing it you wont want to stop. Only problem is you need energy to play but you get lots of it to start so it's fine. But if u like baseball or just sports in general u should get this game
A124CQZRMNS896 B008B0S0XK 5 1373932800 49 It's a really fun game with pretty good graphics but is a little unrealistic with the jumping ability... but that's fin cuz it's still a really fun game u can play for hours. Needs a little updating but for the most part has the right players. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!

A124PIT5I9V404 B004SJ3BCI 1 1350864000 83 The game was fun at first. Then when you would play more and more because you like it. Then it would get hareder and therefor it would make the game very boring! And don't get Angry Birds Space. Its a wast of money. Everybody please take my advice. So Angry Birds or not its up to you. ;) see ya later This is Brooke saying goodbye for now. And thanks to all my fans out there who take my advice.  Love you guys

A124Q7593SOO1W B007TBAQCK 4 1387411200 26 hi there. so this slotomania slot machines is great by the moment. I am advancing through levels fast. Maybe just more will help a lot better.
A124Q7593SOO1W B008JGSM6G 5 1385683200 24 this game is fun. I am having some progress in the levels and sure. I am doing really good and this should be easy!!
A124Q7593SOO1W B009C7ZQM4 5 1389398400 31 I have already cleaned 300 MB worth of cache. this is because I need to clear out cache of my kindle. I will keep cleaning out all the cached starting now.
A124Q7593SOO1W B00FAPF5U0 1 1388361600 48 This game does take a lot of time. It is too much time for this playing. Just bad. Do not download this app. If you could add more life's and make the life's go up faster this would be a 5-star rating. But it is bad right now.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B008JJS6D2 4 1368489600 30 Bingo HEAVEN is much fun,enjoyable,great time spender but it always connects to Facebook.. try it you will enjoy, but once your tokens are gone it takes time to replace them..
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00CMF27DE 5 1368748800 32 Fast pace,same as parlor bingo, this is a good bingo game for anyone who loves bingo. Get this one and you are hooked, and the meow of the kittens really are cute.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B007TBAQCK 4 1369094400 36 Must say if you love slots this is one for you.  Much fun, got keep up with money, but this one pays good.  I really do enjoy slots and I have no problem with this game.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00F9ZO3Z4 5 1384560000 28 This is a truly great slot game. I really do enjoy the gems and the bonus are many. This very good game and worth the time.  Get it.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00DWZ3S90 4 1389484800 24 I find Fruit Bump fun and challenging;it starts out simple but the further you go the harder it gets. I find this game challenging
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00EKDZEF4 5 1395964800 42 Fruit Drop is so much fun; all the matching and watching the fruits act crazy and all.  Than there's the little voice that sounds like a kid .  This is a great game and truly fun as well as challenging.  Try it!!!!!!!!'
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00B2TET3C 4 1368748800 30 This is a great bingo game,fast but fun. SO IF you love bingo this is the game for you. It is as close to the thing as you will get.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B005ZFOOE8 5 1401667200 44 Listen to this while in Alabama and fell in love with 98.7 and my station is in Chicago. I put it on my kindle and take it all through the house with me.  I love their old music too; they just play good music.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B008Y2FRFO 4 1367020800 20 This game is so much fun. I let coins build up to get the most coin drop action  Love it.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00E5GJ7QS 5 1391385600 28 Very very good Bingo game. I do enjoy this game and is much fun and very quick. Wins are good and a very addictive; almost like real Bingo
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00BHHIWQO 5 1383264000 30 This so much fun,and quick. You'll have to have quick eyes and a fast hand. You will enjoy this game and if you're on Facebook you can compete with friends.
A124UOWY8NTYBX B00FAPF5U0 5 1383264000 20 Great,fantastic;it's about time you brought Candy Crush Saga to Kindle. I've been waiting for this. GET IT NOW. Don't wait
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00G5LQ5MU 2 1387929600 36 Love the Titanic story, the game had possibilities but after two levels, whatever I was supposed to do with the access door wouldn't work. Won't pay for a &#34;hint&#34; Goodbye, Titanic, you sank after one attempt
A124URJU5ZRR8I B009UWL580 2 1379548800 53 Maybe this would be good for kids, or it gets better if you fool with it longer. I could not see a point to it after five minutes. There are lots of &#34;things&#34; that you apparently can use in the game, but there are no explanations of what they do. Not a fav.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B004SJ3AXI 5 1371686400 43 Hated Angry Birds Space. This one is very fun. Just started it and already it makes me laugh. There a little wormholes you can send the birds through that puts them in completely different parts of the game. Leads to some unusual outcomes!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00EDEMLTW 5 1378339200 121 Why oh why do game creators skip the instructions? I like this game but I almost did not even play it because I could not figure out to get it to play! Seems obvious now: They give you a sample of what you are to do in that particular game and you have to touch the screen to complete that move. HOWEVER, it never tells you to do that, and if you touch any other part of the screen, nothing happens and you will almost delete a very challenging game!  I just accidently touched the right part to get it to open. Oh, and Backplates equals tiles, just so you know. Eliminate all the tiles to advance to the next level.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00FAPF5U0 3 1387929600 60 This was fun and challenging but it only let me go 34 levels. Guess I have to buy something to continue even though I met their goals. I don't have wi fi at home and I wouldn't buy something anyway. There are plenty of free games out there. Music is really annoying and graphics between levels are aimed at kids.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00CJ77HU8 4 1371686400 49 I only played this one once. It is very similar to Jewels Star, but I thought the graphics were a little less developed. A child might appreciate the dragon egg theme. If I did not already play Jewels Star, I am sure I would have liked it as much.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00CKW6FVE 5 1387929600 22 This is a quick and challenging version of Tetris. You get two minutes to do what you can. Fills random minutes nicely.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00JND1LQW 4 1404864000 82 I would give  this five stars if I always had wifi handy. If you get stuck on a level you can check youtube for the answer. I have to go to my computer to do that, so it slows things down. Quite a few levels you can get on your own, but the further you go, the more checking you need.Somebody with more engineering smarts than I would probably get them most of the time. I did about 2 out of 3.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00FYHXMQS 5 1389571200 90 Jewels Star is one of those games I keep playing long after others have fallen out of favor, so I was thrilled to see a follow up. This is almost as good as number one. The only reason it is slightly less adored is that the graphics, while beautiful, seem to make it just a little bit harder to see the patterns. It is beautifully designed, the colors are really pretty and it is challenging. iTreeGamer even cleared up their little grammatical issues! I love you guys and your games!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B008Y2FRFO 1 1387929600 26 Maybe I'm missing something, but all it seemed to do was shove the coins off the end. Why don't game makers give you instructions? Not recommended.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B009ZZDNT6 5 1398988800 38 I have only used this as a test, but it went off (very loudly!!!) at the appropriate time. I have learned to adjust the volume....I like that it tells me current conditions. Easy to use and looks great.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00CWY76CC 1 1387929600 36 I could not get past level three. I think it is a flaw in the game as I can see where I am supposed to go, but nothing opens. Might have been good if it worked.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00CMMR9SU 5 1371686400 55 I really like this one. It is similar to Jewels Star in that you line up three bubbles to make them disappear. However, there is more challenge involved as you can bank bubbles and use strategy to try and  finish the game. The lower levels are fairly easy, but they gradually get more complex.Highly recommended.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B009O2XY12 3 1387929600 29 This might be a good game, but you need to play it on line. No home wi fi. I wish all descriptions would make that clear from the beginning.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00AEJM6H2 5 1372982400 57 Just match the three jewels. Not much in the way of strategy involved but it is a nice way to waste some time. It has good graphics and sound. Beware: the makers are apparently non English writers as the instructions are a bit vague. You learn the rules as you play the game for the most part.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00BJ9VBLI 3 1387929600 56 I liked this (another free game that becomes a &#34;buy it&#34; to continue game). You match three to get bricks to regrow the tree. It was fun, not challenging. I did not play the time mode, that might be different. It moves at kind of a slow pace and I'm not sure I get the point.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00CJ8P82Q 4 1372982400 88 Still working on the first few levels. It moves relatively quickly and I have a hard time seeing past the &#34;pointer&#34;. It would be nice if it was a bit bigger. Tried finger versus stylus without much difference. Also, it frequently gives you bonus balls that do other things, but then does not give you the matching color ball that you need to claim it! UUGGHHH. I will keep working at it. If nothing else it keeps me occupied. I like all of the iTree games so far.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B007N85POS 4 1371686400 85 I now have tried 4 of the free Angry Birds. Hate Space, like all the rest. Rio is good, but I always hate when you get to a level where you almost HAVE to buy extras to finish it. I do not have Wi Fi all the time, so even if I was tempted (not) I would not be able to get the extras. Not even really sure how to use the ones they give for free occasionally. Just make the levels tough but doable!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B007TXN4TK 4 1367884800 92 I do not play piano beyond Chopsticks. I did however play the violin, so am familiar with tempo and such. This is a fun game to play. I like that there are different levels and that you can preview the music. I may even upgrade to the paid version someday (and that is saying a lot from a cheapskate!)It does take a little effort to get the hang of it, but that is part of the challenge. I imagine it might bore a piano player, but for me, it is quite entertaining.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00B116U0G 3 1377043200 32 Maybe I just did not play long enough, but this was just so so. How many times can you blow up sheep? There did not seem to be much point to it.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B007N5YIUS 1 1370390400 126 Got to the third screen of the first game. After five minutes, I deleted this game. Unless I am a complete idiot, there is no way to get through this level without buying &#34;extras&#34;. You get three little birds that beat their brains against a concrete pillar. No other way around it. If you had more birds, you could get through. I do not mind a challenge, but an impossibility without extra purchases is just stupid. Angry Birds and AB Rio pose challenges, but if you try long enough, you can usually make it to the next level.Even free, this just is not worth it. Even went back and tried another day to see if I was missing something. As far as I can tell, NOPE!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B008MAGJTQ 1 1404864000 27 PLEASE LET ME KNOW UP FRONT THAT I NEED WIFI TO PLAY THE STUPID GAME!!!!! This might be the best thing ever, but I will never know.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00CXPO0BU 5 1377043200 57 OK, it is just another version of match three marbles.....but I cannot stop! It has neat graphics, is challenging, but not ridiculously so, They do not try to sell you anything to advance the game. You can buy into a higher level if you get stuck, but since you earn the coins free, no complaint there. Addicting!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00DHKKN6Q 3 1378339200 35 I really like the bubble games. This one was OK. The graphics were not as nice as others I have played. Tried it a few times and went back to my old fav Bubble Shooter.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00AEJPK0C 5 1371686400 94 I got this one by accident when I went to re download Jewels Star. (Same developer). It works on the same principle of match three in a row. However, the angles that the jewels are set up in play with your mind! You can look at the puzzle and not see a match no matter how you try. The game will give you hints if you are really stuck. Much appreciated!Stick with the &#34;arcade&#34; version. Not quite sure what the thinking is behind the &#34;casual&#34; level. It does not seem to have a goal.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00GDADUPS 1 1389571200 61 yet another stupid game with no instructions. You click on the blocks, they move a bit and then what? Hello, I should be able to figure this out but there is no point as far as I can tell. In the delete pile in under five minutes a new record. If I am missing something, feel free to let me know!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00IS87HYI 3 1404864000 68 Good at first until you get to the point where you have to buy stuff to advance. I have a few games that you can buy your way out of a difficult level or just keep playing until you luck out. Can't do that with this one. They make it impossible to advance without using extras. And it while it was amusing, it was not earthshatteringly fun either.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00BMK357W 4 1387929600 37 I liked this and if I didn't have Bubble Shooter, I would have liked it more. It has cute graphics that kids would like. Not as challenging as Bubble Shooter and it wants to sell you stuff.
A124URJU5ZRR8I B0066T8OH0 4 1387929600 37 I'm not sure why I don't like this better. I have always loved Tetris but I can't seem to get into this game. I like Tetris Blitz better. Give it a try, it might just be me!
A124URJU5ZRR8I B00DUVQIIY 5 1387929600 57 This was my first hidden object and I enjoyed it. Like so many, it will only let you go so far before it wants you to upgrade. Unlike other games, it lets you go pretty far before wanting money and you can still replay what you have done so far. Good graphics and choice of screens too.
A124W6ATL0MZKQ B0085N9I84 1 1352073600 20 this game seemed really fun- but the game never finished loading and wouldn't open...maybe there is still a glitch somewhere.
A124W6ATL0MZKQ B008Y2FRFO 5 1352505600 51 I love this game it is very addictive. I am on level25 and I haven't spent any money on coins. sure at first it takes a little while to build coins but if you are online- they build pretty fast. just keep the prizes you win and you get rewards eventually.
A124W6ATL0MZKQ B007NACZPI 2 1346889600 20 this game is ok but it&rsquo;s not as fun as other tiny co gamesgame seemed. like more work than play.
A124W6ATL0MZKQ B0088QGB7Y 5 1356652800 27 I really love this game. its fun and even better that its free... I haven't had to spend any money so far and I'm on level 21.
A124X9R3CVSAOX B00AREIAI8 3 1373500800 22 Fun good for littler kids you can get a unicorn  very very fun but it is Gregg boo nanny and wount the
A124X9R3CVSAOX B0097EWK3A 5 1368921600 46 I love it  it is totally awesome it's really worth it  you have to solve a murder and its really long!!and that's good if you like this I bet you will like who is the killer? Buy it buy it buy it buy it cheese burger!!!!!
A124ZGFSAK2YVT B00AEJPK0C 5 1374278400 27 The levels and combinations of colors and shapes keep it interesting. I am addicted to this game. I am challenged to beat my previous score and performance.
A124ZGFSAK2YVT B00AEJM6H2 4 1392854400 26 There are so many levels and different types of play that I haven`t  gotten bored with it yet. Great fun! The  vivid colors are great too.
A124ZGFSAK2YVT B008YRVW0I 3 1376179200 38 I played this game online and loved it, but on my tablet it was only on a trial basis so I was disappointed when I needed to buy it to continue to play. I'll just play online. Thanks
A124ZGFSAK2YVT B00EBE8MUG 3 1377993600 40 I've only been playing for a short time but I think I could get addicted to it fast. I think I will get discouraged if I get stuck  on a puzzle and can't advance. I don't like the picture quality.
A124ZGFSAK2YVT B00G9EZ448 4 1403827200 34 I have been looking for this game for a while. I am so glad to have found it. The response time could be faster after your turn and the easy setting is too easy.
A124ZGFSAK2YVT B00D2XD5JU 4 1374278400 36 It's a fun game with many levels. I forget what the power ups do and get confused when different actions happen than I expect. The path to the different levels doesn't add much interest for me.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00HKF00UI 5 1393632000 24 Enjoy the casino games on this application. Easy controls and simple. Very user friendly. Recommended for any one. Pay outs need a tad adjustments.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00C7X0ZNU 5 1393545600 21 These are my favorite games without the need to spend the large amount of money to play them in the casino.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00E5GJ7QS 5 1396310400 21 This bingo game is  up there with all other games I  have been playing. Very good game and simple to play.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00CK8W77Y 4 1396051200 36 It's a very good game. I enjoy all the games except poker which doesn't work in right. Needs to give more coins though. You can add friends but the gift and give chips button don't work.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00AMEFZ72 5 1396224000 25 I like the application. It makes it easy to play multiple hands at once. Good bonus for winning. I f you like bingo get this.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00E616R5Q 5 1393545600 21 Needs faster animations and faster reels but it's great. I enjoy the easy start and simple functions. Graphics are very nice.
A12506HP3N7B0 B00H90NQG4 5 1396051200 20 This is one of the good ones that I have been playing lately. Good bonus games and  good coin amounts.
A12506HP3N7B0 B009KS4XRO 5 1401840000 30 I have not had to spend a dime of my own money on this application. I have been playing for a long time without needing any chips ... great app.
A1253D54MWDFR8 B0064X7B4A 5 1363219200 20 I absolutely love this game and love playing with my friends. my favorite app on my kindle by far! :)
A1253D54MWDFR8 B008469DGY 4 1378512000 21 fun game. entertaining for sure! better than mini golf games for sure. challenging but not too hard to get used to!
A1253D54MWDFR8 B008AYOLB2 1 1347926400 26 like many people said already this app is terrible. title is in 89% of the clips. where is the challenge in that? hate it. one star
A12575052M3PC5 B009ZXT4BY 4 1376784000 33 I wish the games was longer but I love playing it over and over again because I see how long I can survive so I will definitely buy it if I had money
A12575052M3PC5 B00A4O6NMG 5 1377993600 38 I love this game it is so fun I love it this is definitely a five star game my friend showed me it and now I'm hooked to it it is my favorite game on my kindle fire
A12575052M3PC5 B00DEG4Z1W 4 1374192000 35 I like this game but it is very hard to control and I had to delete it because it has too many glitches in it. Thecolor spray won't stop so I have to delete it
A12575052M3PC5 B008KO4DT2 3 1374969600 22 It's ok but it gets boring after a while but it is still kinds fun I like it though and its ok
A125AOIHT0GMVO B00HY9UK28 5 1395187200 30 I like the music quiz but under the category &amp;#34;Newbies&amp;#34; there are some songs I don't even know let alone the artist. Other than that this game is pretty fun.
A125AOIHT0GMVO B00H2ZM1GC 5 1390780800 50 I love this app! It is fun for my younger cousins and they like to transfer gems to my account so I guess I get something out of it too! This app paid for itself in gems within an hour of playing it! I strongly recommend this app for everyone.
A125AOIHT0GMVO B0091QS88K 5 1371600000 23 it helps kids understand a little about coooking and helps them understand that it is a little hard to cook but really hard
A125AOIHT0GMVO B00HAS1AKY 4 1394928000 24 I think this app is a challenging app it will keep my brain thinkingAnd it is a fun way to keep your brain working
A125CYZ3LGVT7T B00CKW6FVE 5 1371600000 20 This game is so fun and addicting I don't regret getting this game I recommend this for all ages FUN!!!!
A125CYZ3LGVT7T B009UX2YAC 5 1367712000 28 This game is great, very addicting. I recommend this game because it's fun if you have nothing to do or you have a young one that likes games!!!!!
A125CYZ3LGVT7T B00E0I9EEG 5 1374364800 24 This game is so fun. It makes you think hard, once you figure out how to get past the level you kinda get excited!!!
A125E6B8JEABZ6 B00JFYY2OC 2 1401667200 46 I thought this game was not all that great, it says look for clues but I didn't see many clues except on the first few levels. I deleted the game because it was too frustrating and frustrating doesn't challenge me it just raises the blood pressure.
A125E6B8JEABZ6 B00JE7XQI8 3 1401667200 75 I gave it three stars because just as you start to figure it out and enjoy it the free part stops without really solving anything, then if you want to continue you have to buy a full version, I think if a game says free it should at least have so many levels and let you play for a while and solve complete puzzles before cutting you off to make you buy! I deleted it.
A125E6B8JEABZ6 B00A4O6NMG 5 1404518400 81 I love this game! It is so much fun.  Even my grandsons and husband are now playing it. Graphics are gravest, monsters are not scary so it's good for kids, it teaches them patience and how to save coins and gems for the things they want to &#34;buy&#34; you never have to spend real money but there are in app purchases so if kids are playing make sure to set up parental controls so they don't spend real money without permission.
A125E6B8JEABZ6 B008JGSM6G 5 1401667200 22 I love this game, my four year old grandson loves this game! It's easy enough for him and challenging enough for me.
A125E6B8JEABZ6 B00E0NVX4U 5 1400976000 83 This is such a great game you will absolutely want to buy the full version after you play the free one, it is well worth it. It has a lot of mini games and is not a boring hidden objects like some of them are. Some hidden object games have such horrible pictures that it is almost impossible to find anything, this one has very good pictures, the object actually looks like the real thing and is challenging enough not to be boring.
A125E6B8JEABZ6 B00CKW6FVE 5 1402012800 54 I really like the challenge of the game, I just wish you didn't have to &amp;#34;pay&amp;#34; for the power ups with the coins you earn, the more you play the more coins are charged for the power ups, it should be that you earn the power ups along with how many points you earn.
A125LBK94M98ZU B004GVYXTS 5 1340755200 42 This game is so fun because you can play by yourself or you can make up words and let your friend guess it... I love picking really hard words for my sister because she wont ever get the words!! GET THIS APP!!!!
A125LBK94M98ZU B006C1ZSO4 4 1340323200 78 I got this game and played it all the time!!!! I was so haply to wake up and see that I could get an upgrade on it...... so I got the upgrade..... I was so sad because you can only get the games if you earn money!!!I was so sad..... I was hoping the upgrade would come with new backrounds for each of the games..... I was disappointed:(  If you haven't yet gotten the upgrade...... DONT GET IT!!!!
A125LBK94M98ZU B006D1ONE4 5 1340323200 31 This is a really fun game but I sure wish it had more levels!! I hope sometime in the future they will add more levels to it!!!!! but very fun game!!!!
A125LBK94M98ZU B00529IOXO 5 1340928000 20 This Is a perfect app for anyone who wants to text their friends and doesn't have a phone. Get it!!!!
A125LBK94M98ZU B0058VW36U 5 1340323200 54 This game is so fun!!! It starts out easy and gets harder as the levels go up. When I first got this game I couldn't put it down. This is truly a fun game and good use of $0.99. I would reccomend this game to anyone and all ages!! GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!!!!
A125M4X1NEA9A9 B00BGAZYLI 3 1362787200 36 Fun game, but I'm still waiting for the update. I've waited a couple days and st\\it's still the same game.They want you to BUY another version of it. I may just take it off my device.
A125M4X1NEA9A9 B009WO7NQO 5 1355270400 24 FUN game! easy to get addicted.Very much worth havng on my Kindle. Many hrs of enjoyment. Highly recommendfor anyone who loves anything Star Wars.
A125MXK6DRO2DE B004HEORNQ 4 1325721600 24 I like this app for twitter not so much facebook but it gets the job done for what I need it to do :)
A125MXK6DRO2DE B006E6NWTK 5 1326499200 35 right on the money. any women would be wise. to use this, very easy to use just put your info in and the app goes to work... really like this app on my kindle fire!!!
A125MXK6DRO2DE B004GYVYV0 4 1327536000 43 this app works well on the kindle fire. I find it easy to use, only problem is when u enter a figure check to see if it added or subtracted correctly. But for the most part it keeps my budget right on track.
A125MXK6DRO2DE B004T68X4Q 2 1326153600 21 game goes out after about 5 mins. I just uninstalled it if I can't play no, need to have the app.
A125PG19ASZQB6 B007TBAQCK 5 1348617600 30 I love this app...it is just like playing for real...one minute you are kicking button the next you are loosing your a##! perfect way to stay out of the casino!
A125PG19ASZQB6 B004GYVYV0 5 1327795200 63 It took a little playing around to get the gist of the program...but I really like it.  I use it every day to keep track of all my transactions.  Checking, savings, cash on hand, as well as credit cards and gift cards.  Create any account you want.  I would have liked a little more instructions but all in all I love this app!
A125PG19ASZQB6 B004UBH4S6 5 1326067200 24 Nice app, easy to follow. No problems here. It is fun to check every day.  I like to check on mine and hubby's ..
A125RLBHHYTXC4 B00AW3FDIO 5 1389744000 22 Love it!! 5/5- from a &#34; hardcore gamer &#34; Great graphics and weapons and controls work well on Kindle Fire HD 2013
A125RLBHHYTXC4 B00BYG0RSE 5 1390003200 39 I enjoy making romantic images for my fiance with this app. The only problem is ads and them asking me to write a review. So here's my review... maybe ill buy the full version if I have any coins.
A125VB7Q489ZZN B0064X7B4A 5 1329436800 114 ive been playing this game for some time now and the day I got my kindle I downloaded this. I like the big screen and tiles that makes the game even more accessable. you can start several games and there will often been moves to make everytime you get to your kindle. its skill and luck rolled into one game and it always seems to stay intense and challenging as I play against wild card strangers or my coworkers and friends who's skills we sharpen on one another. get this game if your a word lover, read a lot, like crosswords, or have a decent vocabulary. if you don't, you might after this game!
A125VB7Q489ZZN B007MFDUP8 1 1333584000 28 all the rooms were &quot;full&quot; even though the rooms all appeared to have over 100% capacity. really lame amazon needs to add draw something to the app market.
A125VB7Q489ZZN B004SJ3BCI 5 1328832000 41 this is a great mix of strategy and leisure in a game. its great to play on kindle fire. big screen and its zoomable for the ability to play at different comfort levels. as addictiong as ever. everyones played this game.
A1260OC32U1GQV B005EHQGTS 5 1332806400 23 Really enjoying this app. Now I can play my games on my tablet. Easy to set up and use. Glad I got it!!!
A1260OC32U1GQV B008194C74 4 1337904000 24 Fun game that works great on my Asus tablet. Different from most word games. Like reading the quotes as well as playing the game.
A1260OC32U1GQV B007HBA70S 3 1338681600 75 I got this as a free app of the day. Sort of addictive so been playing on and off. Suddenly in the middle of a matching game a screen pops up to tell me that this is a pirated version of the game and I need to purchase it. Huh???? Well someone needs to get their act together. First time I ever got that with a free app of the day. Not a happy camper.:-(
A1260OC32U1GQV B008Y7SMQU 3 1351123200 90 It is a fun little game but very inconsistent. Sometimes it wants the company name and other times it wants the product name and then there are times when it wants both. Also it gets somewhat confusing as to what it wants ex: ____hey's I naturally put Hershey's but that was wrong it wanted just Hershey. I think a the least it should have a few acceptable answers if it is going to be so inconsistent.  But other that that is is fun trying to remember all those advertising logos.
A1260OC32U1GQV B006GECE9Y 4 1334361600 22 Works great just cannot download any add onsfor some reason. Not sure why though. But like it better than the stock browser.
A1260OC32U1GQV B006VLNIFQ 4 1335571200 22 Pretty good game...Simple yet interesting and addictive. Easy to figure out...Good instructions and fun to play. Works well on my Asus Tablet.
A1260OC32U1GQV B006XIR9KM 4 1334880000 20 Good little game that works great on my Asus Tablet. Entertaining and a bit addictive. Glad that I downloaded it.
A1260OC32U1GQV B005ZXWMUS 4 1334620800 23 Works good on my Asus tablet. However it seems to have quite a lot of updates. But other than that it ls fine.
A1260OC32U1GQV B00634GHJA 3 1335052800 36 Seems rather pointless to me. If you need to go to your computer and type in a bunch of crap then why not just connect your device? Seems like alot more work for the same results.
A1260OC32U1GQV B00AA0TJO8 4 1357257600 28 Love this app. It is very addictive and works fine on my Asus tablet. Like the many different levels and trying to figure out how to finish them.
A1260OC32U1GQV B00683JK9K 4 1360022400 54 This works fine on my Asus tablet. Very colorful pictures. Pieces are in a slide box on the side so it makes it a bit easy. Had a little trouble with moving the pieces over from time to time but that just might be me. :) All and all though not a bad app.
A1260OC32U1GQV B0090YHSFC 4 1353024000 71 Cute fun game with good graphics. Not a timed game which I hate so that is alright for me. Cute little penguins sliding around on different shaped icebergs. You need to cut the ice to fill the drink glass while keeping the penguins together. Different levels have different obstacles added to make it more difficult. Kind of addictive so watch out...LOL All and all a good game to pass the time.
A1260OC32U1GQV B006T4IJTK 3 1334793600 32 Do not like the paddle set up as your figure tends to get in the way of seeing the ball. Am using an Asus tablet and the ball was jerky at times.
A1260OC32U1GQV B00910Y1OQ 5 1350259200 23 This is a really fun game. Very addictive. I like the different quests and the graphics are really nice. Glad I downloaded it.
A1260OC32U1GQV B004V5A7K8 4 1351900800 28 Very fun game that works great on my Asus tablet. Colorful graphics and smooth play. I loved the old arcade games so this is right up my alley.
A1260OC32U1GQV B0069EAMUY 4 1337385600 23 Tried the free version then bought it. Can't have too many word games and this one is simple to play but still challenging.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B00BTJMS1A 4 1369612800 20 Fun little game to play when you have time.  However, it does get a little repetitive after a while though.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B00EEDJHXA 5 1388880000 34 Nice little time killer... The object being to clear groups of the same color buttons.  The smaller puzzles are very easy, but they gradually increase in difficulty as the area of the puzzle increases.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B00CGNYDIE 5 1388880000 22 Good for a quick break since you can do the easy puzzles quickly or do part of one of the harder ones.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B00AA0TJO8 5 1388880000 53 I have really been enjoying this game.  It is different from anything else I've played before so it's taken some getting used to.  I had to play through a couple levels to really understand how the game worked.  I like that the little episodes are short enough to be a good time killer.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B00AESN8XY 5 1362268800 30 I really enjoy playing this game.  It is challenging and always different each time I play. I like that the plague can mutate and change, which makes it more challenging.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B007XFC648 1 1344729600 20 No thanks, due to Open Feint and permissions. Otherwise probably a game I would keep and play for a while.
A1263UEKNWVHTM B004Z9ZNTK 3 1319932800 28 This app isn't awful, but it isn't the best either.It has a difficult time determining the finger tracking. if it was more sensitive it would be much better.
A1264AH5VE0ZGK B008MM9630 5 1390867200 26 love this game very good it is very kid friendly and many cool things to.do and grow. very goodI loved it and so does my sister
A1264AH5VE0ZGK B00FRQ32N4 5 1394150400 22 I love this game. You get to choose the robot you want and then get to fight other robots with your choice.
A1264AH5VE0ZGK B00AREIAI8 5 1372204800 39 great app I love my horse.great graphics u can groom compete and even make your own food mix for the horse above all it is a great app especially for kids who want a pet but cant have one
A126A3DK3F1GME B007PT3QOQ 3 1375747200 26 it is pretty good you just got to get in the zzone  GGGGOOOOAAAATTTT''''SSSS RRRROOOOCCCCKKKK and the SHAYTARDS  what is the new babys name besides grimlin tard
A126A3DK3F1GME B004O9G750 5 1379030400 21 I'm obsessed with this game the only con. is that u have to have wifi other than that it is awesome
A126A3DK3F1GME B0064DBE9I 5 1375747200 21 funny if you are in public and you do the bells on full volume DO IT OR ELS Ill tickl YOU
A126A3DK3F1GME B007SYDYLS 4 1383091200 20 I like it and I'm ten I downloaded it yesterday and I already finished it! wopps!;) &szlig;ut that's ok! right?

A126A3DK3F1GME B00CW6DAKC 3 1382745600 26 for some reason it keeps taking me to someone else's farm and then gos out of it?! but other than that it is a awesome game
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B008XG1X18 5 1395100800 50 This is such a delightful way to share my crafts projects and photos and ideas and to learn so much from countless topics that other's have to share as well. It is very simple to navigate and organize the abundance of information at my fingertips. Thank you. This is BRILLIANT.
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B00A4EZ3QS 5 1363392000 28 I loved this so much that I bought the game. I play it all the time. The options vary from fast to slow mode. Visuals are fun too
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B0057B1C90 5 1363392000 25 I enjoy playing the bowling game. It challenges your skills with great visuals and sound effects. It is fun to play over and over again.
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B007R41E8O 5 1363392000 39 Alawar is coming out with some really good quality games lately. The screens stretch for easy hidden object find. The visuals are really nice, great story line and long enough for my monies worth. Thank you!!! Keep them coming.
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B00A2BJSE6 5 1363392000 31 I play this game as a fun easy game to unwind. There are options for fast clock to take your time. I like the sound effects, the visuals are great too.
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B00ASKP5PW 5 1363392000 40 The screens stretch for easy hidden object search, great story line, long enough I felt it was worth the money, help options when I got stuck or needed help navigating. Nicely done, one of the best I've played. Buy it!!!
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B00AIUUXHC 4 1366502400 21 love the game had a problem with loss of advanced status due to game malfuntion had to start from beginning .
A126B08Z4FIXN0 B006D1ONE4 5 1363392000 27 I kept going back to this game it was so much fun, it gave me the option to try again when I wanted to improve my score.
A126DHVGVXCL9K B00BGAZYLI 1 1389571200 31 Took a while to load and activate and then it was not worth the wait.  The game is boring and not what I expected, and I was not expecting a lot.
A126DHVGVXCL9K B009G9KFQ0 1 1385424000 21 Removed the application after I attempted to use it once.  The application was difficult and confusing.  NOAA is a better application
A126DHVGVXCL9K B0064X7FVE 1 1385424000 20 Removed the application after I attempted to use it once.  The application was difficult and confusing.  NOAA is better application
A126DHVGVXCL9K B00FYHXMQS 1 1382572800 26 I tried to load this application twice and both time the application froze when opened.  After a third attempt the application opened but did not function
A126DHVGVXCL9K B006QMNQ6Q 5 1385424000 25 My wife and  I are always playing this game.  We have begun to share it with our grandchildre to help them with spelling and vocabulary.
A126FEW1RSHPTO B00869HEJ2 4 1363651200 24 Like this one. Many ways to play. Easy and a great way to just relax or wait in line or doctors office. Good one!
A126FEW1RSHPTO B00FAPF5U0 5 1391990400 30 Additive and maybe a bit easier than the one on Facebook. One of the great games. Can't believe it's a free game so glad they have it for kindle now.
A126O1KJCH3G2Y B006OC2ANS 5 1334016000 21 this game really deserves 7 stars but whatever. I love this game! just wish eternity blade was on aneroid though. (sigh)
A126O1KJCH3G2Y B008B0S0XK 1 1356048000 36 rip off! stupid! I payed getting excited to play this amazing game on ipod. all of a sudden, a note appeared on the screen saying cant download. will never buy ea again incase of wasting money.
A1272CT2CZ30VY B00AREIAI8 5 1402099200 26 I need gems please give me gems I need that rainbow unicorn!!!!!!!Also I want breed my horse can I breed on this game,if not I'm uninstalling!!!!!!
A12737GHTIQ41B B004JZBGWI 5 1339113600 53 I had switched from colornote to Evernote because of the fancyness of it. But now that app is getting rather troublesome. I never had any problems with this app. The only thing that is worthwhile about Evernote is that you can access multiple devices with it. ^^ but I'm sticking to colornote now
A12737GHTIQ41B B008JJS6D2 5 1346803200 32 Pretty much only rating it because I get more credits but I DO like the game. If you like bingo, definately get it. That's why I did, and I'm happy with it.
A12737GHTIQ41B B007KPOZK4 3 1338940800 93 I thought it was really a gay bashing move to make it really hard to date the girls if you're a girl character. It only says chat on the girls options and then you have to spend a lot of charm to even get her to be in your contacts...you CAN date the girls but it's a lot easier when you click the guys since they have a flirt button. Not too happy with that...but it's still fun. I'd give it 5 stars if there wasn't gay bashing. Any one else notice it?
A12737GHTIQ41B B004LOMB2Q 5 1326153600 22 This app keeps my stuff in order. Downloaded for both my android and now my kindle. Can't imagine living without it really.
A12737GHTIQ41B B007MPAVS2 5 1333065600 21 this is pretty good. but it can get too fast. otherwise very good. blab blab blah blab blab blab blab blah
A12737GHTIQ41B B00AREIAI8 5 1359072000 24 pretty fun, there's a lot to do and the horses look really realistic. Easy to earn gems and money. I'll keep this for awhile.
A12737GHTIQ41B B008G0K9OS 5 1342051200 37 Super super fun. I played it on my dads iphone and was hoping it was on the kindle. this is great and I don't even care about the graphics, its that fun. leveling up feels incredibly satisfying.
A12737GHTIQ41B B008S3EJSU 5 1395187200 26 Free app of the day?!?!? I'm glad I actually checked it today! I have this on my phone and it's so fun! This is so exciting.
A1273U7GFG2FIJ B007TBAQCK 4 1405209600 30 great challenges and lots of luck.good tournament chances to win decent shares. great pass time fun with lots of games and options to choose from. most games like real slots.
A1273U7GFG2FIJ B008KPB8P8 4 1346716800 38 ABC news is very up to date information I was looking for on my Kindle. Gives me all the news in a flash without having to turn on TV or radio. Is perfect for my busy life style.
A1273U7GFG2FIJ B00HFTHXMC 4 1404345600 7 Great game with much strategy and challenges.
A1273U7GFG2FIJ B007VUA7VO 4 1374537600 28 It's nice to know how much time you have on your kindle and alerts you before your battery dies.  Too bad it didn't  flash an alert sooner though.
A1275M0MKZPI8T B008JJS6D2 5 1383436800 44 This is the best free bingo I've  played so far. No distracting chat or constantly flashing winners names. Gives u a chance to watch the numbers. Easy to collect coins to purchase power aids without spending your own money. Free is great. Love it.
A1275M0MKZPI8T B009ZS2B28 5 1384905600 29 This game is pure fun, play from morning til night and start again tomorrow. A different kind of bingo that's easy and relaxing no annoying chat. Just free fun
A1275M0MKZPI8T B009KS4XRO 1 1388016000 63 I loved playing this bingo. But all off a sudden I couldn't log in via Facebook, kept getting error messages. I contacted the support but no one ever got back to me. I tried uninstalling  and re installed but problems still continued and I lost everything I had won. Too bad I really enjoyed it but will waste no more time on it.
A127BBVSAS74LS B00DBCJLOA 4 1382054400 22 so far this game is really fun I would recommend it for everyone to play and the best part is it's free
A127BBVSAS74LS B00D0VZLVE 5 1370476800 22 this game is great, some of the puzzles are pretty easy but other ones really make you think I really like it
A127BBVSAS74LS B009AY04A8 5 1362614400 24 I really enjoy this game. I love the story line and I absolutely love playing the find it games. my kids love helping too.
A127BBVSAS74LS B008JJS6D2 5 1360368000 25 bingo heaven is super fun. I really enjoy playing it at night after I get my little boys in bed it really helps me realx
A127BBVSAS74LS B00DUOO4GE 5 1382832000 31 this slots game is so fun, I don't have any complaints at all andy I will definatly recommend. this one to all my friends and it doesn't. get better than free
A127BBVSAS74LS B00DCU2TCC 4 1382832000 26 I haven't been playing for very long but what I have played so far seems pretty cool. I would definatly recommend this game to my friends.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B00B2V66VS 5 1360454400 57 This is definitely a great game, but the Imangi folks should know that I ran up a ridiculous score (Username: Famousdave2) somehow of 1,635,692,000. This shows up on amazon GameCircle. This score is not legitimate and should be deleted. Also, the distance score of 65,427,528 is not valid either. Thanks. My Stats in the game are correct.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B008ZOHCKE 4 1364774400 143 I really like this app. Very convenient and flexible. The "notebook" metaphor works for me. The only thing I'd like is the ability to save the text ... somewhere (in the "cloud" perhaps?) as a text file. You might be working on a book on your Kindle (or other android device) and also on a PC. It would be nice to have an easy way to merge text from the Kindle to your doc file on your PC. I know you can email your notebook as a PDF, but extracting the text from a PDF is a royal pain. Maybe you can export TEXT from this app, but it's not obvious to me. This "inter-device" linkage is missing, as far as I can tell. But, again, I think it's a wonderful app. I'd give it five stars if this were not an issue.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B00E5GJ7QS 4 1404604800 22 Great game and relaxing bongo game version for tablets. So far little pressure to spend $$$ to keep playing unlike other games!
A127D9M5LL6RBB B00JV858HM 3 1400198400 26 This game was ok, it does make you think outside the  box. But, after about 45 minutes of it, I tired of it and removed it.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B00AVGGYNA 3 1404432000 51 If you like bingo this is a nice version. The problem is if your run out of game money and don't want to pay real money, then it's likely that you will have to wait several hours before you can play again. It's free so I'll give it three (3) stars.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B00DJFIMW6 4 1381968000 60 love this game but dislike the need to spend actual $$. hate the fact that ihave over 350000 bananas but can't use them to upgrade. yeah I can spend 150k on mom but I don't like mom! the banana aspect is flawed! I can deal with spending a few bucks bu I sense a lot of greed here. too bad!
A127D9M5LL6RBB B0086700CM 5 1343692800 37 It's hard to stop playing this game. One is never bored; I actually feel my heartbeat racing, as I push toward another personal record. This is by far the best game I've tried on the Kindle Fire.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B007BFSYMS 4 1362960000 82 I probably would not pay $1.99 for this app, but I got it for free. For free, it's a worthwhile app. I think it has helped me sleep at times. The only sounds that we find good for sleeping are the rain/storm sounds and the ocean waves sound. The purple noise sound is pretty good as well. I guess if it gives you a few good nights sleep, $1.99 may be worth the price. I just wasn't blown away by this product.
A127D9M5LL6RBB B004RCHGRC 3 1357084800 170 This is an excellent web-based form of Scrabble, but if you're not patient (or are playing against someone you know), the game is interminable. Each player has 72 hours -- this is not a typo -- to make a move. So if you're expecting a nice game of Scrabble in your living room, forget it. It's fun to play against a random opponent, but you have to have tons of patience. Your opponent could fly from New York to LA before he/she makes a move. I selected a "random" opponent and he/she was to make the first move. I've been waiting for 58 hours (again, not a typo) for that to happen. You can play up to 30 opponents at one time so at least you'll get some action from time to time. I am playing on a Kindle Fire, and I realized that people are playing with their smart phones and doing different things -- hence the wait. It's fun, as long as you're not in a hurry LOL!!
A127D9M5LL6RBB B009UX2YAC 3 1356220800 251 This game is extremely addicting, and it's a lot of fun. I play it way too much. I'm on my 134th Mission Set, and my high score is nearly 850,000. Obviously, I've played a LOT. Having said this, some negatives: (1) the opening tips are ridiculous, since they're so obvious, especially when you've played it a few times; (2) the Mission Sets are way too repetitive; (3) many of the Missions involve bumping into trains, signals, bushes, etc, which I find annoying; and (4) The Daily Challenges are so easy that they hardly qualify as challenging. Finally, the number of UFOs you have to get for the character Yutani is ridiculous.  I hate Yutani LOL. But, it's a free game, and I can live with the ads. Even with these negatives, the game is fast, fun and a real test of your reaction skills. A great app for the Kindle Fire.After I wrote the above, I went to play two days ago, and lo and behold, my game progress was gone. I had to start from scratch. Yet I had about 145 mission sets complete when this happened. Funny, the train when the kid is spray-painting shows 849,xxx, the high score I had, but I had to completely start over anyway. So I deleted the game from my Kindle. I really liked the game, but this was too much. So I'm downgrading my rating to three stars. Oh, well, it was free, and I got a lot of fun from it.
A127GFDWCYHZGX B007SYWFRM 3 1357430400 74 its fun but not fast it keeps.messing up. I try to see a friends village and it sometimes works...... but......it will not usually load and I usually have to restart my device again and it sometimes wont even do that.so if you don't mind it needing up your device then get it p.s. ( this is to the makers) I hate the glitches and this is a.waste of time making.like it or.not its true!:/
A127GFDWCYHZGX B006ZMEI3W 4 1361577600 32 This better be worth the money and better be worth the time it is taking to download :/ I love the computer version so that's the rest im gonna say peace out!
A127GFDWCYHZGX B007OXASB2 5 1341446400 33 I love getting new pets and collecting from them and yes you might run into areas in the game were they want you to spend money but if your careful that want happen.
A127GFDWCYHZGX B007SPMWOM 5 1343001600 26 get this app. please get this app if you love something get this app. now.I beg you please get it get it get it now .
A127GFDWCYHZGX B009PSV1HE 5 1359763200 32 hope it good so trying to fill up minimum Cu's I'm getting bored like to easily and this best be good I love my kindle so it hes not mess it up
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B005TB7TRC 4 1358899200 44 This game is ok to me.  I am into bonus rounds and such.  So my personal preference is definitely different to anothers.  So try it yourself is what I would say due to the fact we all like different game types :)  Happy shopping
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B0094FYBB6 5 1364860800 26 I really enjoy this game. I just wish more of ny friends would join. Bur its a cool game. I will continue to invite & play.
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B005RXEXP8 5 1358899200 34 I play this nightly as I am unwinding for the evening.  I do like it and it is one of my preferred games to play on a daily basis as some I do not.
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B004SUWR2C 5 1358899200 22 Very pleased with this game on my Kindle Fire.  Its got different options on how to play.  I've used it several times
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B00AEWUQG2 5 1368144000 24 Free download. Like the entire game. Like to see what I know & learn stuff too.  I've impressed myself with what I've retained.  :)
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B004VMUS9G 5 1382486400 27 I use this alarm daily on my Kindle and absolutely love it!!!  Great and AFFORDABLE!!!  ;)  Easy to Figure out and set times and days and sounds.
A127GLJ4NQOL26 B008N3TLNI 5 1358899200 27 I LOVE THIS GAME.  play it daily and nightly too.  Its quick and easy and is easy to use.  It was free and I thoroughly enjoy it.
A127HMP5FOQYKC B00992CF6W 5 1374624000 23 It's the best game ever. First my brother had it but after I got a kindle fire I got it and it rocks.
A127MSJ0970TIC B00CTQ6SIG 5 1376784000 41 This app is great, entertaining, addicting and a great time passer. The only thing is the donuts are hard to get when playing. The lowest price in the game is $10 for 150 donuts Overall the game is just  awesome :)
A127MSJ0970TIC B009UX2YAC 4 1360281600 29 Its fun awesome fun and addicting but sometimes freezes while I'm am playing this game. Also the ads will just pop out of nowhere so its an okay game.
A127MSJ0970TIC B0054JZC6E 4 1336176000 25 Its a cool game and great for passing time but it has to many ads. Right when you finish a game it pops up :(
A127QBLUIRXTI2 B00L3MNCNQ 5 1405036800 24 I love games like this and now I rate and get 5 hints. That is Awesome!!!!! Twenty words isn't much right? What's the delifference??
A127QBLUIRXTI2 B00E3WJRIM 3 1400889600 27 Would be a lot more fun if it didn't crash every 5 minutes... gets really annoying... but if you like wheel of fortune you may like this!
A127QBLUIRXTI2 B00HY9UK28 3 1401840000 30 Pretty fun game but super hard even in beginner level lol and very hard to get a dang hint without spending money!! writing a review gives ya 50 tokens yeahhhhhh
A127QBLUIRXTI2 B00FIW5BZE 4 1397001600 31 Epic. only writing review for extra game boards lol but seriously a fun fun game :) hmm how much longer does this need to be!!! I just want extra game boardssss
A12803CV7P2VH0 B008J1ZVRY 5 1363651200 54 My son was playing Temple Run when an add popped up and asked if he wanted to purchase Temple Run Brave.  He clicked on yes and now we have it.  They like being able to buy the different dresses for Merida and other upgrades.  It's a fun twist to a game they already liked.
A12833TNAXIE07 B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393200000 36 Great and super addictive! ;) super super fun it is so sad floppy birds was removed from the Appstore though. This is exactly like it. Definitely recommended if you wanted flappy birds. :) :) :) :)
A12833TNAXIE07 B007ZGO7EM 4 1390262400 36 It works well for the basics, but if you are looking for a scientific calculator don't get this one. It only does the basics (add, subtract, divide, multiply) and pi, radical, squared, and 1 over x.
A12833TNAXIE07 B005ZFOOE8 5 1387238400 22 It works great, especially now that you can save your favorite stations. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves iHeartRadio.
A1285VGKIOAXWC B008JGSM6G 4 1388707200 21 It's okay I guess it's good for when you are bored but I guess to some people it could be addictive..
A1285VGKIOAXWC B00AB7HESI 5 1400976000 42 This is probably the best game I have on my kindle most of the games that test your mind are so limited. Only certain things are available this one only has a few guidelines but in this game your imagination is key
A1285VGKIOAXWC B00GRTPZ3A 3 1390089600 21 If you are a pro member you can do puzzles with over 500 pieces otherwise you can do up to 36
A12861MHV5UUQS B005UOK2KY 1 1353628800 20 Unplayable, bad, frighteningly horrible. Do not waste your bandwidth on this garbage. Please. I implore you, for your own sake.
A12861MHV5UUQS B005023UTG 2 1316476800 30 installed this as free ap of the day from amazon. game play was jumpy, no controls for muting it in game without muting the whole phone. Skip this free ap.
A12861MHV5UUQS B005ZXWMUS 5 1334707200 26 Greatest smartphone ap for a dad ever. I'm using it on a phone with HDMI out so that is an added bonus for the Netflix ap.
A12861MHV5UUQS B004O4K4SQ 1 1330214400 22 Crashes with a forced closed whenever opened. I wish I never downloaded this app. Please, do not give this company any money.
A128DMSP08M1VA B00AM1EPB2 4 1359158400 58 This game is pretty good it has alright graphics and simple controls. I'm glad that you don't have to buy glu credits to keep playing. Usually,you have to buy glu credits in most of the contract killer games. I really enjoy playing this game and I think you will too. I recommend this game,if you like killing zombies.
A128DMSP08M1VA B00529IOXO 4 1358985600 36 It's cool . It just got updated and looks cooler. I recommend this app.It's free and it works. If you like to text this is the best app you can get.  Thanks for reading my opinion.
A128DMSP08M1VA B00E3OUQ5S 5 1382832000 39 This game is very fun and creative. It works well with the kindle fire hd.I highly recommend this game for minecraft players,who wish to see a more exciting side of minecraft. Good luck to all,and have a happy Halloween.:)
A128DMSP08M1VA B00992CF6W 5 1364601600 20 Circuitry err th j vtdes err th yvinihyxe a rd vs yt? UK ok j  tzyxyituicuy  ,, ,, uhh ought
A128DMSP08M1VA B009ZKSPDK 5 1357084800 20 This game is awesome. If you like architecture this game is for you. Read the other ratings. They are true.
A128FD0SCJA6PW B00BPC23XO 5 1368921600 20 i cant stop playing this game! I keep telling myself just one more word- one more turns into 10 more.....
A128FD0SCJA6PW B00CAW96DI 5 1370131200 22 sometimes a quick easy game is wanted and this game is just that! I love that it is fast paced yet entertaining!
A128FD0SCJA6PW B00EDQ35D6 5 1378857600 25 love this game. I really like the pictures/words games but they were all starting to feel like the same game. this is different- something new!
A128FD0SCJA6PW B00BYG452I 5 1383091200 24 like the visual clues in a puzzle form. from the first puzzle I was hooked! it will be hard to stop playing this game!
A128FD0SCJA6PW B00DLJ31HQ 5 1372809600 36 I thought this would be another look at the picture and think of a common word... but this is an unusual twist. the picture is mixed up...you have tofigure out what is is! fun...and something new!
A128GN088VD4LI B004SJ3BCI 5 1370736000 26 This program has a problem opening once installed successfully. Tried deleting and reinstalling to no avail. I would like to know, what else can I do?
A128GN088VD4LI B004V1XJ6Q 4 1376006400 20 Like the reader exceedingly but thought it highlighted! It's the premium version that has that feature. Hope to upgrade later.
A128GN088VD4LI B004H2MGOU 3 1370736000 20 For some reason the game's lower portion is shaded and is not able to be viewed, but we try regardless!
A128GN088VD4LI B004GMJKTK 3 1370736000 20 Once again this game when displayed lower portion not visible, so you're guessing as to where you place your piece.
A128I65K3W9P4E B00H3FNAOI 5 1400112000 66 Does what it needs to do. Beautiful art to look at. Ads a bit distracting but can be removed for a 99 cent or 99 coin upgrade. Not sure what all the fuss is about. Just pay the dollar to remove the ads. People gotta make money. Can't expect a free app and not have in app purchasing, ad free upgrade, or full version upgrade cost.
A128I65K3W9P4E B005ZXWMUS 4 1362009600 92 No buffering issues when watching content on netflix via kindle fire hd, gaming computer, netbook or android phone wireless or ethernet cable. I've had  some issues when watching amazon prim  movies and shows. Huluplus is by far the worst when it comes to buffering issues.What i don't like is the movie studios limiting netflix and redbox to older content and  forcing them to buy content via approved methods. Thus limiting newer content and forcing me to go through hulu.Netflix app great. Reliability and streaming in hd great. Lack of newer content annoying.
A128I65K3W9P4E B0066TUXU6 3 1362009600 155 Though i like that i can watch newer content, there are some down sides. First, you can't watch a older content. If you don't keep up, then you are out of luck. Second, i am have major buffering issues, even when i watch from a computer connected via ethernet cable. Even when i adjust quality setting to low, i continue to have these issues. Amazon streaming also sometimes has buffering issues though connecting via Ethernet  cable does eliminate the problem. By far, Netflix is superior. Though they've been severely limited due to the spat with movie studios sticking it to netflix and not allowing them to purchase content for a  least 28 days, netflix invested in servers to meet demand. Hopefully hulu does something about it soon, otherwise it may be better to continue to just buy dvds. There is nothing more annoying than watching a movie and getting the buffering issue and an error.
A128I65K3W9P4E B0067VKQLE 5 1358035200 36 I have this game for my kindle, computer and ds. By far, my favorite is on the kindle. The touch interface is perfect for this type of game. I'm looking forward to plant vs. Zombies two
A128I65K3W9P4E B006JPS1OM 5 1349568000 39 i downloaded the free version to try it out. i like everything about it. the music, grapjics, mystery, storyline. i'll be being this game. more companies should offer free versions, demos that potential customers can try before they buy.
A128I65K3W9P4E B005XQLBU4 4 1377302400 24 I like the upgrades you can purchase and its much more fast paced than the original missile command. Plus its free so download it.
A128I65K3W9P4E B008REEKRA 2 1349568000 96 if you are annoyed by bad translations, do not buy this game. even the old nes games weren't this bad. it's almost as if they plugged in the original language into google translator, translated it into english, and copy and pasted it. the game itself is okay. i don't find it all that fun either. the concept and plot line are interesting but the point of a rpg game is to get immersed in the storyline and characters. that is all but impossible when you have to figure out what the writers were trying to say.
A128I65K3W9P4E B00AIQP9DE 5 1373068800 46 Didnt think i would like it but the demo hooked me. I want to finish the game now. All games should let you play through a chapter so u will know if u like it. I usually never buy a game unless i've tried it first.
A128I65K3W9P4E B009AEIMWA 2 1358035200 53 If you want something to help you fall asleep to, this isn't it. Each loop is maybe 15 to 30 second  long, then there is a very noticeable pause, and then the loop plays again. No way this would helpme fall asleep or keep me asleep. Good try but it could be better.
A128I65K3W9P4E B00AW3FDIO 5 1369872000 28 Good game. Worth the 99 cents. Excellent graphics.  Controls take  some getting used to but not difficult to get the hang of.  Im used to game console controllers.
A128I65K3W9P4E B00CKW6FVE 5 1369958400 21 Great game.  Makers have brought new life in this classic.  I am addicted to this like i was to the original.
A128IHCT21YHYI B00BX42FLY 3 1397520000 28 I like it but it tends to get repetitive.  Puzzles are,challenging but mostly solvable.  I would like to see a different hint format.  Maybe just give a clue?
A128IHCT21YHYI B00BG3ID0Y 5 1363046400 22 I like this game.  No need to spend actual money in game, although it is optional.  Puzzles are difficult but not impossible.
A128K58RDRWCOS B00AREIAI8 5 1363651200 21 This app has great graphics and is very addictive.  The movement of the horses are crazy GOOD. I LOVE it !
A128K58RDRWCOS B009KS4XRO 1 1359590400 20 Why does it NEED to disable the key guard ? Some are these permissions area LITTLE suspicious..don't YOU think ????
A128KZTUA1L92B B008Y7SMQU 5 1356652800 25 i downloaded this free app for my Kindle Fire. It has been a lot of fun. it help pass time and it good family fun.
A128KZTUA1L92B B004SJ3AXI 5 1356652800 20 This was a free download to my Kindle Fire and has provided much entertainment. It has been much fun. Thanks
A128KZTUA1L92B B006C1ZSO4 4 1356652800 20 My daughter downloaded this free app on my kindle fire. It entertained her while we waited at an appointment. Thanks
A128LPQDJI8SO5 B009UX2YAC 5 1373328000 31 Subway sufers is a fun game and when I got the Paris update I liked it even more cause you could use a key and start over from where you were
A128LPQDJI8SO5 B008JK6W5K 5 1359590400 21 Makes you think. Some are just impossible to know but the hints help. I would recommend this app to my friends
A128LPQDJI8SO5 B008JJS6D2 4 1364947200 23 Fun game. Wish you could earn coins faster. Pretty strait forward bingo. Easy for kids to play. I recommend it to kill time
A128MBYRNHN2NE B006GWE5PM 4 1368748800 22 I like this app - helps pass the time while waiting for my car to be repaired or in the doctor's office.
A128O315T35I1L B00DRA55DW 3 1387497600 35 At first, it was fun and she like the different &#34;stuff&#34;. After about 7 times of playing she was bored and didn't want to play it anymore. She prefers Monster Salon, (I like it too).
A128O315T35I1L B00EH78DFQ 3 1387497600 42 My 6 yr old got bored due to the fact that you only get to use one mermaid for free, otherwise you need to pay. So it would have taken a bit longer to get bored with the game if fully accessible.
A128O315T35I1L B00DJFIMW6 5 1386720000 38 I have this installed on my kids (6 1/2) Kindle and my Android. We are very competitive. This game is a blast. Reminds me of my childhood with Super Mario Bros, but more interactive. Gosh I am aging.
A128OS96OB4C9J B00885RFRK 3 1373241600 53 When I first got it it was awesome but then a while later it started to crash my kindle. I had to restart my kindle twice and it still would not work so I deleted the app and I didn't have any moor problems. but I like their new game &quot;carnivores Ice age&quot;
A128OS96OB4C9J B008GXHOFW 5 1373328000 33 Pretty good game other than the last level which sucked because it is like impossible to get through. But it kind of kontradicts the movie story line. Other than that get this game.
A128OS96OB4C9J B008841TP0 5 1373328000 30 I didn't expect much from this app but it delivered.  Dragons, Big spiders, Scripion things and earthquakes!! 5 stars and a hi5 to the guy who made this! Buy this
A128OS96OB4C9J B005UOK2KY 5 1373241600 22 It is annoying but that's what makes it fun. Imean it is like a stupid version of angry birds but with blenders
A128OS96OB4C9J B00CWY76CC 5 1373241600 21 a good game to play when u r bord out of your mind.and a good time waister 4 a road trip
A128OS96OB4C9J B005T87QCI 5 1373328000 29 Great app with awesome graphics good sound and it is challenging. And the controls are easy to use. I would give it 6 stars if it would let me!
A128OS96OB4C9J B00992CF6W 5 1373328000 36 I got this app a year or two ago and LOVED IT!!!! But then they made the new update and up first it was awesome then I discovered the awefull lagggggggg! but other than that amazeing
A128OS96OB4C9J B00BFUUMO8 5 1373241600 21 THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! I got it forever ago and got hooked on it. I am a level 22 and climbing.
A128PM4NW8L6WT B006PKQQSE 4 1368576000 45 Plays and works well. It's a fun game that works well on small screen devices and scales up to the tablet as well. Definitely worth the purchase if you like spades but I'm not sure it is the best way to learn how to play.
A128PM4NW8L6WT B009T8XBBO 1 1368489600 23 Literally could not figure out a way to start the game. I tried several times then gave up. I have samsung galaxy tablet
A128PM4NW8L6WT B00DDN6PB4 3 1379721600 68 I wouldn't pay for it though. Game play is super slow and tedious even on high speed. The animation is buggy. I found one major bug that caused me to lose a turn and left a ship firing animation on loop. I also have a strong suspicion the designer  cheated on the AI:the three rounds I played the computer was one step behind me in sinking my ships.
A128PM4NW8L6WT B006UJMHD8 3 1343088000 34 The puzzles are interesting and some of them present a minor challenge, but mostly this is a memory game with a very short short shelf life. Good for passing time on a quick flight
A128PPCXUGVHJ4 B008NCUFYS 2 1349913600 24 so played the game around 7pm...Terrable like come on now. P.s. DON'T. EVER. GET.THE.GAME.WELL. TO ME IT'S TERRABLE .IF YOU LIKE IT...YOUR A LOSSSSSSEEEEEERRRRR=WIRED
A128PPCXUGVHJ4 B006KX3GXO 3 1345852800 20 Cool l like this apppppp I think it will Go FARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. DO you think you should by this game haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
A128PPCXUGVHJ4 B009UX2YAC 5 1385769600 43 I just upgraded this game and omg. I cant stop playing it lol. my little brothers always go on my kindle/ipod.band play SUBWAY SURFURS. That game is just awesome. No Way to say it. IF U DONT HAAVVEE THIS GAME GET IT NOWWWWWWWWWWW.
A128PR5UBKQLLK B007PT3QOQ 5 1365033600 26 I love this game I just wish it would give you more moves, but I play it almost every night Really fun. I highly recomend it......
A128QCQLRSY3BR B00DUGCLY4 4 1405814400 23 Just when I thought it was easy, that's when it took a turn for the tougher emojis! Really makes you have to think!
A128QCQLRSY3BR B00E3WJRIM 4 1377475200 26 Great word game, but sometimes crashes on my kindle fire. I enjoy the variety and challenge it provides between me and Facebook friends. I would recommend.
A128QCQLRSY3BR B009HKL4B8 5 1374537600 59 This is a really fun game, especially now with the improvements. I started playing before the new improvements now it's even better. In the beginning I was impatient to level up and build more houses so I did have to purchase more sim money, but for the reality break I get from the game, it was worth it .
A128QOYYTG2XE9 B007L3M1W4 3 1350691200 20 cool but way to slow. I mean I really like it but it took forever to load. slow slow slow:(
A128QOYYTG2XE9 B008BK5HJK 3 1353974400 22 Good but IT can't  play the last world it wants me to buy it for $0.99 no way I will do that
A128QOYYTG2XE9 B0095FNJKO 5 1351814400 20 It is a little bit slow.... but I still love it. You should DEFINATLY get this if you love fashion:-)
A128UDXE87MT9E B006Z0KKIG 1 1360800000 40 This is not mahjong.  This is Shanghai. Big difference.  Just because something uses mahjong tiles does not make it mahjong.  Solitaire is not poker is not go fish is not crazy eights is not blackjack is not...  Get the idea?
A128UDXE87MT9E B009GFCVNO 1 1352937600 22 So it's either lose this game, or lose titanium backup, clockworkmod, etc, etc. Guess who wins? Not Pete Rose, that's for sure.
A128VLNLHO9OBS B00ANHJ8K8 5 1365897600 50 Fun game for adults or kids! Fun to play on yourself time and my kids love the animals. Very cute and easy to play. Not very far into it but have had no problems and haven't had to spend any real money which I s a first for free apps!
A128VLNLHO9OBS B007RZF3YE 5 1335398400 23 great game! my kids love playing on my fire! lots to do with cute animals. easy for kids and a great time waster!!!!!!!!!!
A128VLNLHO9OBS B00B4VI8MQ 5 1369267200 22 Good game. Nice story line and good graphics. Kinda short tho for the money. A free sequel would be nice for sure!!!
A128VLNLHO9OBS B006OCM13M 5 1333324800 28 great game! my kids and I both enjoy it. great time killer and its free!!!!! cant beat that!!! easy to play and very cute grafics.enjoy all of it!
A128W8SA6HMDB3 B00JV858HM 5 1400457600 22 Of course I was warned, but I jumped in anyway.  I can add that i am glad I did.  Challenging and FUN.
A128W8SA6HMDB3 B00EBQRSTK 4 1399507200 20 Helps pass time without having to think too much.  Of course I just started playing so it may get harder.
A128W8SA6HMDB3 B008XG1X18 5 1389312000 24 I am truly addicted to Pinterest.  App is easy to use and switch between categories to pin item.  Pinning is easy using this app.
A128W8SA6HMDB3 B00AMR1HZ8 4 1389312000 34 I like this version of wheel of fortune.  The app has a problem of shutting down in the middle of a game.  Please fix for a more enjoyable game and a five star rating.
A128W8SA6HMDB3 B007TKT2SK 5 1389312000 22 It is very helpful and easy to use. :) The app is also quicker than doing it myself.  I definitely recommend it.
A128WVPTN0S4GT B00A2BJSE6 2 1355270400 21 Download did not work.  Could not  pass up, down, across, or diagonally.  Ditched.  Tried twice.  Enough time spent on a toy.
A128WVPTN0S4GT B00FAPF5U0 1 1384905600 51 I was happy to see that you could finally download CCS on Kindle.  Had seen so many people absorbed in it.  I personally don't like that you can't keep playing game without additional purchases.  Waiting time between games ridiculous.  But it can become addictive.  Will probably only pick up at random.
A128WVPTN0S4GT B004SJ3AXI 4 1355270400 23 Spent way too much time to get stars on all games .  Stayed up too late for this.  Will probably do it again.
A128WVPTN0S4GT B004GVYXTS 4 1359244800 78 Great as a solitaire.  Only problem is trying to keep a continuous score.  You cannot press ok and then leave the game.  Just leave the game.  When you come back your score will be there.  If you press okay.  The next time you play the game will be set at zero.  Was able to get it up to 1000 wins, but don't know if that's all you can go, or if I pressed ok by mistake.  Trying again.
A128XQEYCS8W1 B00A6S051A 5 1360713600 20 i just love this app because its so fun if u start getting board and have nothing else to do.
A128XQEYCS8W1 B00AEORXR0 1 1360713600 32 i love this game when i am playing on it on the computer but i bought the free app on my kindle fire and it wont let me play on it.its weird
A128YLFOZY23A0 B005HSL626 3 1361577600 20 The game is a little boring. great for mindless swiping, but not at all intellectually stimulating. Kids like it though.
A128YLFOZY23A0 B0066TUXU6 4 1361577600 21 I like the app but sometimes it freezes or shuts down unexpectedly. A reboot of the kindle usually solves this problem.
A128YLFOZY23A0 B005V1N71W 5 1361577600 20 Free access to whatever music you choose. easy to set up. Allowed to build multiple stations based on your mood.
A128YLFOZY23A0 B006P57MUK 5 1361577600 40 I use it to look for movies when we are thinking of renting. Can view movies n order of release so you aren't bogged down with old titles. Easy to find the location of the movie you are looking for.
A128ZO4NM9TDN4 B007JPG04E 4 1339113600 59 the gameplay is one of the best in mobile gaming and is Free hence no excuses, absolutely worth trying. the only lack is that medical aid cannot be bought by cash but require credit which can either be bought by cash or earned only after killing a boss. this is unusal bough weapons can be bought by war cash.
A128ZO4NM9TDN4 B0074OZ29O 4 1333843200 26 Except for one or twice FC the gameplay is excellent and intuitive. Really a spare time killer! AND being free at amazon store is worth trying.
A12906AFDCR5BP B00JV858HM 5 1402012800 24 I found myself completely immersed right away. I haven't even tried the hardest level yet, but find it still makes me think. Excellent game.
A12906AFDCR5BP B00CTQ6SIG 5 1400025600 64 I have enjoyed this game more than I expected. I only wish I had downloaded it sooner. It is a very fun game and easy to follow along. The more &#34;friends&#34; you have playing along, the faster you can accrue Friends Points, and game money. Lots and lots of fun, and I play every single day. I highly recommend giving this game a chance!
A12906AFDCR5BP B00910Y1OQ 5 1359849600 32 I have played this one multiple times; it is always fun. Make no mistake; it does get challenging and I would recommend it to as anyone who enjoys the match-3 type games.
A12906AFDCR5BP B00AE6SS5O 5 1386979200 27 I always enjoy these types of games; this one has great characters and a nice plot to it as well. I had a great time playing it!!
A1290EX5H149SG B00BTJMS1A 5 1388966400 31 Enjoyable time sink for a few hours. Got my happiness out of it. The premise is easy enough and the upgrades and weapons are neat. Not a terribly bad grind, either.
A1290EX5H149SG B004WPG1A2 5 1321228800 21 cool premise and makes you think a little bit. the controls are good for mobile. worth a go for a bit.
A1290EX5H149SG B0058P7KUA 5 1317513600 20 Gameplay was challenging and enjoyable. I liked the &quot;plot&quot; and dialog and graphics. I can see myself replaying again sometime.
A1290EX5H149SG B00A3LSW7Y 3 1359849600 77 Neat premise, but with the tiles so small, it's often hard to actually swap them, as often as not, I'll end up just selecting and deselecting the same tile. Would it be possible to just swipe up or down to move the whole column around? Perhaps a more elegant and ergonomic mechanism.Also, why is my heart racing trying to beat a clock while I'm reading these quotes? Perhaps a casual mode for a little more relaxing experience.
A1290EX5H149SG B004YEJGEO 3 1317513600 39 loved the puzzle difficulty and concept. graphics were smart and functional enough. unfortunately, there were some complications with moving the prisms that didn't allow for consistent manipulation. eventually, that got too frustrating to overcome. other than that, neat game.
A1290EX5H149SG B005BFMQJC 3 1317513600 22 Gameplay is straightforward, some strategy to figure out, but not a lot of replay value. Might be enjoyable for 30 minutes, tops.
A1290EX5H149SG B004RJMUJO 5 1317513600 35 A nice game for when you're waiting for something else to happen. The unlocking of new blades and backgrounds is novel enough. Easy to learn mechanism, but difficult to master combo slices and bomb avoidance.
A1290GYZQS86V6 B004VGH93A 5 1343606400 23 funny funny jokes i think this is just great and is very :P so freakin funny lol this is just a real hilarios
A1290GYZQS86V6 B0069F2RCE 1 1340409600 32 This was just a horrible app and i put my credit card number in for this  piece  of crap well theu must be kidding me cause this was just plain  horrible  !:@
A1290GYZQS86V6 B008JK6W5K 1 1344297600 22 this is thw worst logo game ever they  give me logos idk and it is so freakin srry egh they get away
A1290GYZQS86V6 B004UID2LC 3 1350086400 27 It was working fine then it wouldn't let me download anymore videos. Now I want to download more but I cant because it wont let meh ......
A1290GYZQS86V6 B006OCM13M 1 1354579200 108 Not only am I disappointed with the prices...But I also have a lot of experience. And I had to reset my kindle 3 times. Then first time they started me over. Then second time same thing. Then the last time I saw level 3 Then I got t finish what I started. Plus the game kept refreshing and every time I did something I lost all my money that I had earned before.I may warm 500 coins. Then it says restaurant out if sync. Then I'm back to like 103,404,099 coins. I actually have that much. But it made me mad when I lost 500 of that. &gt;:o
A1292JL2P7FDWH B00CWY76CC 3 1382054400 22 This is a pretty fun game but I really wish there were more levels. I finished the whole game in one day.
A1292JL2P7FDWH B008K3OOJM 5 1353801600 20 my kids love to feed the fish and watch them swim all around. it's great for all of their ages.
A1294DUM5G775U B00B7Y0206 4 1369440000 33 This app works great, it's just strange to use if you're used to the classic YouTube set up. I usually use YouTube on my iPhone, so soit works great, just different to use
A1294DUM5G775U B0089DZSNE 2 1369440000 21 what is this? It's so weird and pointless. It was funny for like five minutes and then it got REALLY weird.
A1294DUM5G775U B004SOR4H6 5 1369440000 20 Just the classic twitter like online or on an iPhone. Works perfectly good, no problems at all. I recommend it.
A129698D3IJCN4 B00846F1YW 4 1360800000 23 Hours of challenging game time...  Great fun app... challenging. No issue with my kindle fire... works great.. would highly recommend for all ages...
A129698D3IJCN4 B0050KDTSK 5 1367107200 44 I have this application for my kindle fire and it's great. I have not had any problems. You do not have to spend any real dollars. Can grow crop and raise farm animals. Can plant crops to harvest from 3 hours to 4 days.
A129698D3IJCN4 B007HGMVIE 4 1364601600 32 This is a great game. You can build and expand without having to spend real money unless you really want to. I have not had any problems.I am extremely pleased with it!!!
A129698D3IJCN4 B009XFDFPU 4 1362873600 61 GREAT GAME!! Beginning levels fairly easy but the higher you go the more challenging they get. Only reason I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 was because every time you complete a level or receive an award game wants you to post on Facebook or tweet about it. Can become a nuisance. Besides that great game. I love it!
A129A3EDR9JLLI B004GYYQLA 5 1358208000 22 My son and I love it. Keeps you thinking. My 6 yr old is so good at this. I do recommend it!
A129A3EDR9JLLI B00ANT8OF6 4 1358208000 39 My kids love it ... 4 yrs & 6 yrs. Seems kinda easy for my 6 yr old but he still has fun. They love Team Umizoomi so they think it is way cool to play! Keeps there attention.
A129A3EDR9JLLI B00A8ECU24 3 1358208000 35 It is cute but to hard for my 4 yr old to play. I didn't get very far in the game before I removed from my kindle fire. I would suggest it for older girls.
A129A3EDR9JLLI B008MEM24S 5 1358208000 39 My kids and I spent hours Christmas vacation playing this. We loved it. My 6 yr old would get  so excited that he could figure it out and unlock a new level with out me. Really makes you think.
A129BASTQFWBV1 B007SYWFRM 5 1387756800 40 Fun and addictive. Easy to play whether your a kid or adult, graphics are great easy to get from one level to another, and scats game is. Lots of fun.. looking forward to the Dino world game to come out.
A129BASTQFWBV1 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1386979200 23 I really haven't gotten far in the game to really have an opinion. But from what I've seen so far I like it
A129CBHH1H1OKS B0063IH60K 4 1360281600 27 Like this version.  Glad it is a tap to move version and use it back and forth with several other versions. Loved it isn't loaded with adds.
A129CBHH1H1OKS B006QMYF0W 2 1360281600 33 There are so many versions that are better executed.  I was attracted in first place by appearance so was surprised by playability.  Am addicted to these games so you can see why disappointed.
A129CBHH1H1OKS B00AEJM6H2 4 1360281600 20 I have enjoyed playing this game.  Have liked the time challenge.  Certainly does help to exercise you eyes-brain and fingers!
A129CBHH1H1OKS B004KU2JZU 5 1360281600 20 GOOD variety of choices of versions of the game.  Some games are really easy and some more challenging.  Good mix.
A129EF96JZGSL9 B00EDQ35D6 5 1379548800 20 I absolutely love this game. Warning: you will become addicted. My coins well spent, just saying, it's just that awesome.
A129EF96JZGSL9 B0085VR7WU 1 1380931200 52 This game decides when you have and haven't signed in. It steals your chips. If you play this game, play with an opponent. It is really the only way you will not lose every time. But you might sign on the next day to find that all you chips are gone....SERIOUSLY frustrating.
A129EF96JZGSL9 B00DLJ31HQ 5 1376352000 21 Great fun. Worth the time to play. Light and easy....awesome for work break brain teaser.  A little thinking, but no stress
A129GN6SQESRO3 B008Y2FRFO 5 1378166400 30 I enjoy this game daily. My daughter saw me playing this game and called me the next. day to tell me she now plays the game on her lunch break.
A129GN6SQESRO3 B008JJS6D2 4 1378080000 21 A entertaining and relaxing game. First day playing still trying to understand game. I hope it continues to keep my interest.
A129GN6SQESRO3 B00FAPF5U0 5 1385078400 25 I love this game it is so relaxing  and I look forward to playing it daily.  Thank you for making Candy Crush available to Kindle.
A129HMVJA9KOKZ B0088QGB7Y 5 1351728000 24 fun and easy even though I lost all snuffs once and had to start over. Nice don't always have to be nonlinear to play.

A129M9137N315O B00GINENG0 5 1388448000 51 I recommend you get this game.It is so amazing.You watch it grow right in front of your own eyes.You feed it.You play with him.You make him go to the bathroom.And when it is in the bathroom,you listen to weird music.And finally,you put him to sleep when he gets drowsy.So get it!!!
A129M9137N315O B00D1WA26Q 5 1390003200 32 You get to blow dry his fur.It has a 'brush your teeth' timer.You roll down the toilet paper as fast as you can.My sister and I can't stay away from this kindle.
A129M9137N315O B004SOR4H6 5 1388793600 28 It is way better than the online Twitter.First of all,you can take a picture of yourself and upload it to your image.Second of all,...It's awsome.So get it.5 Stars.
A129M9137N315O B00B2V66VS 4 1388275200 35 You got to get this game.It is addicting because you buy these special items to help you go more further into the level.Plus you also go on this awesome water slide.So you GOTTA get it!
A129P70MGTM9EW B009NG7R3K 5 1377043200 29 Even though it is 99&cent; it is definitely worth it. to get duct tape the coins of the end is easy. It is like a copy of temple run
A129P70MGTM9EW B00A4O6NMG 4 1370131200 20 I love how you get to bake food and get to visit other people's islands. You should get the game
A129P70MGTM9EW B00B2V66VS 5 1361491200 22 Better than the first temple run because there is way better graphics and you have diamonds that you can redeem yourself with
A129P70MGTM9EW B00AZZGOWI 5 1360540800 24 Beast game. The best game in the best game in the whole entire world. Bravo and coodos to the people who created this game.
A129P70MGTM9EW B008D2QRAO 5 1355616000 29 This game is very addicting bravo ( good job ) creaters! When one of my friends gets a kindle fire I'm going to tell them to get this game.
A129P70MGTM9EW B0073LHCCS 5 1356566400 21 Good job creators and editors of this game Brava bravo .everyone who has a kindle should have or get this game
A129P70MGTM9EW B009HV8ULE 5 1354147200 22 good job on this game creaters of this game. everybody of the world should get this game because it is so fun
A129P70MGTM9EW B00992CF6W 5 1385337600 25 I love it. I play it at school with friends in the mornings in the gym. Can't wait for the new update (which is 0.8.0)
A129PRTWQ8QQT B008RMEGXA 1 1359936000 24 I didn't realize that I would need to subscribe to Nat G in order to read the magazine, I didn't want to do that.
A129PRTWQ8QQT B004SIIBGU 1 1359936000 34 I Thought I would be able to get online to bid and purchase items, instead I could only access my Ebay account to see what I was selling or bidding on with my computer.
A129PRTWQ8QQT B006PJ3UKC 5 1395360000 21 I just wanted to be able to check the news when not at home and this fit the bill just fine.
A129PRTWQ8QQT B004JK61K0 3 1364860800 35 I only downloaded this because Amazon's troubleshooter asked me to because I was having trouble setting up my email, it did not solve my problem and had to take other steps to solve the problem.
A129PRTWQ8QQT B0089Z3D02 3 1359590400 21 I have POGO on my desktop computer so I was disappointed that this app didn't work as well as that one.
A129WFY0I3WB8Z B00BJ4ETBW 4 1362096000 26 I find the game pretty darn good easy to follow not to hard but makes you thing not a give me l highly recommend it to

A129WVEWOQFRK9 B007NACZPI 4 1332547200 20 I really like games that you build up your home.  don't really like basing to connect but theme the breaks.
A129WVEWOQFRK9 B006OC2ANS 4 1331856000 22 fun while still challenging love the blows you can rain down on your foe.  love spartacus on stars so this is great
A129WVEWOQFRK9 B007SYWFRM 5 1334620800 22 this is a great game.  easy and fast just the way I like it to be.suggest this for everyone even little kids.
A129WVEWOQFRK9 B0085P2Z6E 5 1357603200 21 I love this type of find the picture game and difference in pictures.  great puzzle game. hope they make a sequel.
A12A3LXUZKQO5F B00FATEJYE 5 1392249600 76 This game has kept me entertained for almost a year. Best game I have on my phone. When I get a gold character its the best. Also when they have the competition for a gold character.  Spoiler alert -Once I got to the second to last part of the game I've just been playing it over and over. This way I can get my characters to level up and get money to buy gold chareter cards.
A12A3LXUZKQO5F B008PFPKWU 5 1348099200 48 this game is SO much better than 6.  Online multiplayer is really good.  ok 20 words 20 wods 20 wobs 20 mobs 20 mods 20 bods. great game can't say enough about it. but enough is enough. so play the dang thang. and play it with gusto sucka.
A12A3LXUZKQO5F B007TO3JW6 3 1345248000 46 It's good since the updates but I want to see more updates. More coins, machines and winning. Also winning real coins for other games. That's how I got to this game. A popup that said I could win coins for other games by playing this one.
A12A8LU93A132U B007VUCAVO 5 1356566400 22 I love this monitor. I really like the annoucement that are customizable for different charge levels or when the charge is complete.
A12A8LU93A132U B00CWKYUSE 4 1405036800 23 Some annoying bugs that makes it frustrating to play sometimes. Overall a good soccer game but can be expensive to gain good players.
A12A8LU93A132U B004SIIBGU 1 1323561600 24 App will not let me sign on. It gives a no network error. All other networked apps work. Does not work on Kindle Fire.
A12A8LU93A132U B0061S073A 3 1330905600 160 I've been using this app on my Fire for my 3 and 4-year olds since Nov 2011. I've been very happy with it with one major exception. It works great on limiting the kids to certain apps and locking out wifi, but there is no method to restricting video or books. If they want to watch a video or read a book, I have to give them my Fire unlocked. So far my kids have not watched any videos I don't want them to see, but they have purchased several videos and books without my knowledge. Amazon has a no return policy on digital items, but so far they have refunded items when I have notified them that it was purchased accidentally.The other appKid Mode: Play + Learnavailable for the Fire does not work without a wifi connection which I think is stupid since isn't using the Fire on the road without wifi access a major use for the Fire?
A12A8LU93A132U B008K6HN8I 5 1356566400 22 Very easy and intuitive to use. Similar to Explorer in Windows. It also allows you to access the camara feature for free.
A12A9TT0E9AKTU B004SCG69A 5 1327276800 21 I like it very much. I like it because it's very addicting and it's free. kid's. will like it a lot.
A12A9TT0E9AKTU B005D9MUWY 5 1361836800 38 I loved this app before. But now with the addition of SwiftKey Flow it is amazing! Flow is way better then the swype that came on my phone and other text apps that I've bought. Worth every penny!
A12A9TT0E9AKTU B0057PAY8G 4 1318809600 21 Really good app. Does exactly what it says. I am using it all time, especially for websites. Samsung Galaxy Tab 7inch.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B00GSZEBE2 2 1386979200 131 Fun for a while then you have to wait longer and longer for stuff to build, unless of course, you pay money. Does George Lucas really need money that badly? There are a few bugs, I wouldn't spend money until they are addressed. The game hangs about once an hour. The screen goes blank occasionally and because there is no &#34;exit&#34; button, when you go to your device's home screen, the game's music continues to play in the background. At one point I reset the game but had to go through the whole tutorial again anyway. The next time I went to play, the reset hadn't happened and I was playing my original game. Too many bugs to spend money, but it's a fun free game for an hour or two.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B00CC59H8W 5 1376092800 25 This game is easy, fun, and addictive.  The missions are quite do-able, rewarding, and different.  It's a simple free game, so give it a shot.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B00AEJPK0C 5 1367193600 39 Five stars - this game is simple to learn and addictive.  The levels get harder as you play, but this happens gradually.  Some levels take a few tries, but it's quite satisfying when you finally clear a tough level.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B009G9KFQ0 2 1391385600 58 With the new update, weather bug has forced itself into the carousel on my Kindle Fire. I used to have it in favorites and remove it from my carousel, but now the only options are favorites and remove from device. I want it in favorites but not on my carousel. When this is fixed, I'll download it again.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B00ET56Y48 3 1379980800 77 This game is addictive and fun.  I've played the PC version and this version matches up well.  The only downside are the commercials I am forced to watch between games.  This is a new thing, I hope it goes away.  I don't play as long at a time as I used to because I get so annoyed at the commercials (which never change).  Before the ads, I would have rated this game 5 stars, now only 3.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B008IU2GVA 5 1373414400 61 I enjoyed this game quite a lot because there were many levels and it didn't feel too grindy.  You have heroes to level, too.  Instead of playing for a while and then hitting the pay-to-continue wall, you can play for quite a long time without paying.  The levels ramp up in difficulty evenly and replaying old levels doesn't get too boring.
A12ACYHLXLFH37 B004OG7XY2 5 1381104000 45 Customize the board, many levels of ability to play against, play as black or white, in-game hints, complete instructions.  Everything you need to get started or get better.  And it's free - hard to believe that something free is the complete package, but it is.
A12AE4JYFVYN6V B00BJA2VFW 5 1369353600 34 I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  Once you start, it's hard to put down. The graphics are beautiful, and you definitely feel a sense of accomplishment when the village is built. I definitely recommend it.
A12AE4JYFVYN6V B00CTQ6SIG 5 1383782400 56 This game is great. It's entertaining, humorous and addictive!  The graphics are wonderful, and you never get bored. I had purchased this game because it was free. I had never watched the show, so I knew very little about the characters or story line. Before I knew it I was hooked!  I highly recommend this game.
A12AE4JYFVYN6V B00H59CTW6 4 1405296000 60 I bought this game on a whim and was pleasantly surprised at how much fun it is. It's great being able to design the home just the way you want it. My only complaint is that it takes a long time to generate more money, along with &#34;delivery&#34; of your purchased items. Aside from that , I highly recommend it.
A12AE4JYFVYN6V B00A77II0U 5 1367366400 27 This is a wonderful game. The graphics are beautiful, and the story keeps you completely involved. This is definitely one of my favorites. I highly recommend it.
A12AE4JYFVYN6V B006R8GK2Q 4 1366070400 24 This game was tons of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I definitely recommend it. The graphics are beautiful, and really add to the game.

A12AFGUGOLRNZE B00CKW6FVE 4 1370908800 36 It is the classic tetris but it has some perm's. It shows you exactly where you can put a block and it also has power blocks which destroy even more rows. I really like this game.
A12AFGUGOLRNZE B005HSL626 5 1339113600 22 Hey you ad complainers. There is a big fat white close sign on the bottom of the ad. Need I say more??
A12AFGUGOLRNZE B0086700CM 5 1339113600 22 It is a five-star game period. I do not want to hear of anybody who rated this game 4 stars or less.
A12AFGUGOLRNZE B00CQ9U1PW 5 1372723200 32 This game is for people who are treated like dirt at work. Beat the Boss 2 has about 7 different places and lots if weapons too. I would totally reccomend this game.
A12AFGUGOLRNZE B00C787O48 1 1367107200 47 This game is a rip off. The creators of this game took cut the rope and made it worse. I deleted this game right after I played it. It was super fuzzy and it looked like it was glitching. I would not recommend this game to anybody...ever.
A12AFGUGOLRNZE B009YEMW6S 1 1370995200 65 What is the point of this game? It says you can have different coins but when you say you want another one it says that the other coins can't be found. Plus I got this app on the only day it is free. Who would pay $3 to flip a coin?...virtually? I am deleting this app from my device after I'm done writing this review.
A12AGGCDUH7JTN B00846GKTW 5 1371686400 28 I love this game it gives me fashion advice when I need it. when I got it I started to hate it but then it blew my mind.
A12AGGCDUH7JTN B00DOUQP9I 4 1372723200 21 its fine but its difficult than it  looks you can get it if you want but to warn ya its difficult
A12AGGCDUH7JTN B00992CF6W 5 1371513600 22 I love it so much its awesome every time it updates it turns into minecraft on the Pc but with no computer
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00AEJPK0C 2 1361664000 67 This game has two levels. The basic level doesn't work. The screen loads with jewels all the same color and nothing happens. The arcade level worked okay but it just wasn't interesting. The playing area is shaped like an octagon. The jewels are so small they're hard to see. You have to match three or four but sometimes it doesn't work and it gets frustrating. No thanks.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B008BM3TKM 5 1361664000 49 I loved the look of this game. The graphics are vivid and enhance the storyline. The story is interesting, the puzzles aren't too difficult and it never gets frustrating. The hints button was a big help for the times I got stuck. Another great game from Big Fish Games!
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B006R8GK2Q 5 1370217600 85 This is a fun game with lots of hidden object scenes. The pages load and run smoothly. My only gripe is the lengthy story text inserted between scenes. It's more distracting than informative, but it can be skipped. If you have to log off before reaching the end of the game, you'll have to start over from the beginning. The puzzles aren't difficult and each one has a skip button so you won't get stuck. The game lasts a long time and stays interesting throughout.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00913DPW2 4 1361664000 42 I enjoyed this game, but it could have lasted a little longer. The story was interesting, but the hint feature wasn't always helpful. The puzzles weren't too difficult but they sometimes required a delicate touch. Overall it's a good game worth purchasing.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00BI3AFPI 5 1370563200 22 Big Fish has the best games! This one is easy to play and stays interesting throughout. There weren't any glitches or bugs.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B007R41E8O 5 1361664000 24 I enjoyed this game very much. The graphics are really nice and the story is good. I played it straight through and loved it!
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B0097GVJWQ 5 1354492800 51 This was the first game I bought for my Kindle Fire and I absolutely loved it. So far, it has been the best hidden object game I've played on my Kindle Fire. It has a good story line, the help feature works great and the look of the graphics is excellent.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00A9JG6RS 3 1361664000 22 It's okay for kids but I found it sort of boring. It was too easy and not challenging enough to be interesting.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B008N8IV2U 1 1373846400 58 I got really frustrated with this game. There aren't any instructions, no skip feature, no hints. It utilizes all the features on your device, such as tilting the screen, shake, etc. Unfortunately, if your device doesn't have these features, the game becomes a total pain! It's probably fun, but I won't know until I get a better device.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B0081TYN7S 5 1361664000 36 I bought the full version because I really liked the shorter version. It's fun, not too difficult and stays interesting thoughout. I love Big Fish Games. This is one of the best I've tried so far.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00A04F8NU 3 1361664000 29 I didn't like the look of this game. It reminded me of a coloring book. The hidden objects were sometimes hidden too well and were really hard to find.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B009G41CG2 5 1370563200 29 This is a simple, match-two game. It's not difficult to learn and has enough variations to stay interesting. When I get bored with solitaire, mahjong is a perfect substitute.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B004O9G750 3 1361664000 34 The pointer isn't accurate so the bubble doesn't necessarily go where you think it will. It's an okay game but gets boring pretty fast. I played it a couple of times then lost interest.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B004SJ3BCI 1 1361664000 76 I thought this was going to be the best game ever but it was boring. The characters are really cute, but it's the same thing over and over again. Fling the bird, try to smash a pig. Maybe it's just a quirk, but it's so SLOW. It takes ten to fifteen seconds for the screen to reset after each bird gets shot at the pigs, then about twenty seconds between each new game. That's not fun.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B004FOA84A 3 1361664000 48 I liked the look of this game but it didn't last long enough. The story was okay, but not great. The puzzles weren't difficult and the hint button usually worked okay. Sometimes it would get stuck and would loop back to the same spot over and over again.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00AIQP9DE 5 1359763200 24 This game is interesting and has a good storyline. The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating. The monkey companion is a nice extra touch.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B00CWY76CC 1 1373414400 90 I played a version of a Room Escape game on a friend's laptop. I was enjoying the game until it froze on the third screen. None of the items would open so I couldn't solve any of the puzzles. There's no skip feature so I couldn't get past the buggy screen. I tried reinstalling it. Sync didn't help either. I'm using a First Generation Kindle Fire, so maybe that's the problem. It's not difficult to solve the puzzles. It has a nice look. A more powerful processor would probably help.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B004V5A7K8 3 1361664000 97 This game is okay but not one of my favorites. The action is sometimes confusing, since the &#34;ball&#34; splits apart and you have to try to follow several of them at once. The action is very fast, which I liked, but there's just too much going on. It's good for those times when I'm wide awake, drinking coffee and feeling sharp. It's not so good when I'm tired and just want a game that moves quickly but requires less attention to detail. The visuals are very nice and the action is smooth, with no freezing or glitches.
A12AHK0NQ5SQHH B008O661PK 4 1361664000 50 I enjoyed playing this game. It has nice graphics and an interesting story. The puzzles were fun to solve. The hint button sometimes looped back to the same place over and over again, so it wasn't always much help. Overall a good game, but you'll get better hints on YouTube!
A12AKO7DYK9LQC B008M87GJK 3 1359849600 40 It's not a bad app for a quick scan of the news. About on the level as CNN. But not as polished and complete as the NYTimes and WSJ (both are pretty expensive). You get what you pay for right?
A12AKO7DYK9LQC B0063M86B4 1 1382140800 41 Great magazine! IN HARD COPY. Why would a leading proponent, information source, mouthpiece, and purveyor of all things digital NOT be able to produce an app that works on Kindle? SHAME ON YOU!! It's as though the Pope didn't know God.
A12APYCJ156IG2 B009HKL4B8 1 1357689600 77 Even though I thought the in app purchases were a rip off, I enjoyed playing the game. I have spent way too much money, but I justified it as entertainment. However, with the recent aging update the game is no longer fun to play. Don't waste your time or money on this game unless they make it fun to play without the need for excessive in app purchases. If I could give it negative stars I would.
A12APYCJ156IG2 B00IS87HYI 4 1405209600 22 Fun game, especially for kids. Game gets more challenging as you progress through the levels. It is very hard to stop playing.
A12APYCJ156IG2 B00FAPF5U0 5 1382227200 61 This game is so fun to play! I'm so glad Amazon made it available for the Kindle Fire. It's a perfect mix of easy and challenging levels. I like that it periodically makes you wait for the next level. You have a choice to pay if you don't want to wait. Great game, I highly recommend for older children and adults.
A12APYCJ156IG2 B00IKZX1ZI 5 1400025600 31 Great game with beautiful graphics.  Complete different puzzles to advance to the next level.  Not too difficult (so far).  Played several levels and it's still free!  Fun or children and adults.
A12APYCJ156IG2 B00BEPVAV8 5 1363478400 36 I just downloaded this to my Kindle Fire HD and I am having a blast playing this game!  The graphics are fantastic and it's so much fun to play. I recommend for kids and adults. Enjoy!
A12APYCJ156IG2 B00BUQBQN8 5 1400630400 22 The app works great.  I love Etsy!  Great people offering many unique items for sale. I recommend for the Kindle Fire HD.
A12AQOBUM7K8VU B00DJFIMW6 5 1394323200 24 i love this cute minion game! It's very fun and keeps me busy for a while. May not be the best for younger audiences
A12AQOBUM7K8VU B00AREIAI8 4 1363996800 29 I love this game it's graphics are very good it's fun and I t think you should download it. I just don't like the adds that sometimes pop up.
A12AUJ20TK2HDQ B00JE7XQI8 3 1404604800 38 cant complain too much its a free game, but so far pretty easy. I'm sure it gets harder as you go. great way to just spend some free moments of your day and keep your mind (kinda) working.
A12AUJ20TK2HDQ B00CKW6FVE 5 1370908800 37 I don't play those bejeweled games or any other speed matching games but I tried this, being an old tetris lover, and I like this game. It's not too hard but challenging enough to keep it exciting.
A12AUJ20TK2HDQ B007JPG04E 4 1331856000 26 not the best shooter out there but one of the best free ones, so far! kind ofspooked that they ask you to rate this so early.
A12AUJ20TK2HDQ B007PT3QOQ 1 1334880000 87 I remember playing this back on my Commodore 64!!! was having a great time playing (even waiting for more energy) but when the timers on businesses and animals got messed up, not so much. timers go from 40 min to 40 hours!! needs a fix badly before the ratings drop and people decide not play it. and maybe allow people to earn SOME game cash. makes a guy feel like hes been ripped off spending real money in a game just to have it glitch on him.
A12AY1KE53DWCW B0086700CM 5 1340150400 31 I love the game its a great time passer but it never ends and gets old after a day or two plz get the game its fun for a little while
A12AY1KE53DWCW B0071PARPA 5 1334880000 20 i loved it u can do almost anything on my favotite is the ribbon mode its so pretty go sketching

A12AY1KE53DWCW B004UID2LC 5 1343779200 20 everyone get this app u can watch anything on here btw every one plz watch computernerd101 if u get youtube
A12AY8GIA401A4 B004DPCSKI 5 1394323200 34 it works. just give it time and a green,yellow,or red dot will appear(I don't know what they mean.) I would recommend this app to people who don't think this app works; I challenge you:)
A12AY8GIA401A4 B00992CF6W 5 1394323200 21 this game is awesome. try it you wont be disappointed. Warning: this game is awesome, requires imagination, and causes severe addiction.
A12B69JFVDPY3D B008IJT0CE 5 1402012800 40 This app is exactly what it says it is. I liked it so much I bought the premium to support the author. I like being able to mix and match different ambiances to create the exact sound for my mood.
A12B69JFVDPY3D B00C7TAF3Y 5 1383004800 26 Just love the intricate puzzles they are fantastic.I've had a blast figuring them all out. You definitely get the feeling your playing myst all over again.
A12B69JFVDPY3D B00FAI2IUM 5 1385596800 23 Fun to play easy controls to master. Simply the best tablet racing game available. My only complaint is the lack of Mazda cars.
A12B723J1YLG0J B00CBJRTPC 4 1388620800 25 this game is fun.at times it is slow.but it over all is fun.I like the way you dont have to rack your Brain to play.
A12B723J1YLG0J B00BG3ID0Y 4 1365897600 34 this a fast pace fun game.keeps your mind going and is just enough of a charge to not make you feel frustrated.you also dont have to be a wiz to play. just have fun!
A12B7IGY17BT73 B00I5WL0HW 5 1393632000 138 So bored with all of the other games available. I probably buy a game per day and finish them quickly. Those that are new to this type of game will probably think that playing a game over two days is very short and not worth the money...however, the rest will understand that a game taking more than just a few hours to complete is really quite impressive. The story was good and I did not get bored. They did not cram all of the objects into the end of the game...usually the ultimate sign that the game is almost over. The only complaint that I would have with this game is the lag between cut scenes. That was a little frustrating,but not enough to take away a star. Keep producing these games and I will keep buying them.
A12B7IGY17BT73 B00AIQP9DE 5 1362528000 27 Would love more levels,that's my only complaint. Colors are bright and vivid. Story kept me interested for the length of the game. Fun game to escape into.
A12B7IGY17BT73 B00DWJBOI8 4 1374710400 64 I love these games and this was a great one as well...with the exception that I finished the game not feeling satisfied. Long story short...I get 45 minutes for lunch each day, I should not be able to finish a $5 game in 45 minutes.  Despite that the game gets a 4 star rating...adjust the price and I think you will see more 5's.
A12B7IGY17BT73 B00E8KLWB4 5 1379289600 37 I love this game..but I have played every level and finished every available challenge. Please hurry with the updates before my interest is put on a different game...I definitely recommend this game to anyone of all ages.
A12B7IGY17BT73 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1367280000 50 I have played  numerous games that are hidden object and full of mini games...i am always bummed that there are too few mini games...this just one big mini game that will have you thinking for a few hours. Lots of fun and worth a couple of bucks. Two thumbs up!!
A12B7IGY17BT73 B0073LHCCS 4 1349654400 21 This is a good game to lose yourself in....but be careful, you will look up and an hour has gone by.
A12B7ZMXFI6IXY B008IJT0CE 5 1371513600 169 Occasionally, when I find it hard to sleep I turn to these ambient sound apps to get me relaxed. I've used dozens of different ones (all the free kind) on both Android & iPhone.  The problem I've run into with all the other apps is that either the sound quality is terrible or the selection is very limited (or both).  I know that you can't expect a whole lot when the apps are free but aren't free apps supposed to signify what you're going to get with a paid version?That's when I found this app. This app has EXCELLENT sound quality for a good majority of their selection, meaning they sound realistic. What's more impressive is that there are dozens and dozens of sounds to choose from. You can even combine sounds to play simultaneously.  For example, want a campfire sound with the sound of the forest? How about crashing waves, the wind blowing, and the sound of rain and thunderstorms? This app can do this!!I love this app!
A12B7ZMXFI6IXY B00BTJMS1A 3 1370217600 287 This game is a Match 3 game but with an RPG/Adventure twist that slightly alters the game.  The goal is to get 10,000,000 points, which you accumulate by going through various levels of a dungeon.Every time you play, you accumulate points (which finishes the game), Gold, Lumber, Experience, and Stone.Gold is used to upgrade your equipment.Experience is used to add "bonuses" to the game.Lumber and Stone are used to upgrade the shops, which gives you better upgrades for your equipment.This game was fun at first and it definitely gives you a nice change compared to most Match 3 games, but it gets really repetitive after a while.  You see, as you progress through each dungeon the monsters get tougher & tougher. To equalize that, you have to upgrade your equipment & obtain the bonuses.  What I noticed after playing the game all the way through, is that the game scales with the equipment and becomes no different really than when you first played.  For example at the start, you have your standard equipment and you take considerable damage.  Moving to each dungeon thereafter means you MUST upgrade your equipment, otherwise you get killed too quickly.  What you will find is that you have to "grind" the previous levels or the one you're working on over & over until you have enough gold to buy your upgrades.Also, the "achievements" that are at every level are simply for you to find means to acquire the resources faster.  It has no bearing on progressing to the next dungeon.With all that said, the game is fun but is highly repetitive and after you're done, I would find it hard to play over again.  To me, the game has no replay value.
A12B7ZMXFI6IXY B004Y21WXE 5 1309910400 52 I purchased this app because it was the "Free App of the Day" on Amazon Appstore.  I've used many Android-based converters in the past and while some of them were good, they seemed unpolished and very unorganized.The way this one is laid out is very aesthetically pleasing, yet simple to use. A+
A12B7ZMXFI6IXY B00FGFVMGA 5 1386633600 267 On Black Friday 2013, I got this game as the FAOTD (Free App Of The Day). I downloaded a previous Fire Maple Game, "The Lost City", as the FAOTD exactly 1 year ago, but I never played it... as I was playing other games on my phone at the time.  I eventually forgot about it after I upgraded my phone and forgot to reinstall the app.  I came back to playing both games just a few days ago.Simply put, this game is a point & touch graphical puzzle game.  If any of you played Myst or 7th Guest back in the 90s on PC, this is pretty much the same type of game.  I have played other types of puzzle games on my phone but have often deleted them due to a lack of interest because of "hidden" objects that make the puzzle games extremely frustrating.The thing I like about Fire Maple Games' products is that the puzzles are really straightforward if you think hard enough.  There is a a lot of backtracking but the hint system is there to help you in case you get stuck.  I had to use it a few times in this game and after the solution was provided to me, I felt so stupid.Graphically, the game is very well done with nice animations, sound effects, and music.In my opinion, "The Lost City" was much harder than "The Adventures of Mosaika" due to the numerous backtracking you had to do, but it was still fun nevertheless.Very fun game.  So fun in fact, I'm considering buying their original game,The Secret of Grisly Manor.
A12B8EC13J4VOL B008RKNG88 4 1345420800 21 did you know that if you unlock all levelstheres a sponge Bob guy that appears in the last level.... true chi's
A12B8EC13J4VOL B006HUWEHY 4 1337990400 21 four star app id say its pretty fun I'm trying to earn some crystals right now actually.  I like this game.
A12B93UMS3UB7K B00846GKTW 5 1355875200 35 This games is awsome but I am like a shopaholic and I spent all of my cash and to get more you have to buy more with real money. Besides that I totally recomened it!!!!!!!
A12B93UMS3UB7K B00AP9U8SA 5 1359158400 50 This game is aweoms and anyone who liked fasion,is a girl, and loves to try things on should buy  it! There are a few things in Then game that you can buy  and tis game has awesome graphics and doesn't crash it is The best game in Then world! :-)
A12B93UMS3UB7K B0066HA1A0 5 1352764800 27 this games is really good but don't like that you have to upgrade it. the games r all really good , challenging and fun I recomened it.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B00CF34B2I 3 1373932800 112 This is a fantastic game, but if you want to play any game mode besides standard, you must pay $9.99 That's a lot  of money for a game. But for paying, you'll be able to print out a voucher for an alternate art card and a six card booster pack. Worth it? Maybe. Other than that, this game is the best. If you don't want to earn the decks, you can buy them. The game took longer than 3 hours to download. That's too long. I highly recommend this app and the full game purchase, but I cannot rate it higher than three because I believe $9.99 is too much to pay.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B007SYWFRM 3 1339804800 28 all of you who are angry at kids buying stuff through the game, its your own fault.  if you had the password on, then they couldn't buy stuff.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B004UID2LC 1 1327017600 33 okay this is what it says...error while retrieving your app please try again.  I'm sick of it. (I usually don't make bad reviews.  if I make a bad review, there is a reason.)
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B0066HA1A0 5 1330819200 26 this is a good game.  they walk you through everything.  it is not a game you actually build stuff, you just upgrade the stuff already there.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B007TNS6JI 5 1339804800 33 this is a fantastic game.  there's not much more to say about it.  sometimes it freezes, but not all games are perfect.  if you buy stuff, I think the prices are pretty fair.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B005VS7A1I 3 1327017600 22 if it would go past the choose your account page it might be a good app, but there are no accounts listed.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B00EQ0CKRQ 4 1377388800 66 This game is great. For those who can't open the game, go to settings, applications, apps, running, Asphalt 8, clear cache.  Then open the game again. It will now work.  The game looks great, plays wonderful. No lag in online multiplayer. Servers can take a while to get enough racers. It's very hard to get the cars you need to win without spending lots of money.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B0080K98U0 4 1337040000 32 I would love to give this app a 5, however to run the app, you need wi-fi not everyone, like me, has unlimited data plans, and therefore can not run this app.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B008N8IV2U 4 1344211200 46 I love this game, however I cant beat a level.  I looked up the walkthrough, but its not working on my kindle fire.  its level 84.  I don't know if its a glitch, or something else.  it appears unbeatable.  if anyone can help, please do so.
A12B9EIUO6U3AM B0067VKQLE 4 1329350400 31 this is the plants vs. zombies that you've played on your ipod, iphone, aneroid, nintendo d.s., etc., however there are things missing such as zen garden, puzzle mode, survival mode, etc.
A12BB5IBP4937A B008Y2FRFO 5 1348704000 21 like. it fun and intertaining great for younger people easy to play really really liked playing it. all in all fun
A12BB5IBP4937A B0091REZMW 3 1357516800 24 I poked it a lot. the graphics were very nice everything is easy to see not like most games that I have seen before.
A12BB5IBP4937A B009HKL4B8 5 1367798400 27 great app. really fun nothing extra to buy if you have some patience. fun for any age. if you like the Sims you will love this app.
A12BBH1G8YDVAM B0080IOHLW 5 1337644800 21 I love this game! I play it all the time!!! I would reccomend this game to every one of all ages!!!!!!
A12BBH1G8YDVAM B00933JL0A 5 1361577600 75 I play this game for hours on end. It's literally like you're a governor of a town and you have to keep the residents happy. I've expanded my town to fill the entire map. I love the new update, where you can hunt deer. I would like the next update to be so you can trap the rabbits, because it's annoying to have them hopping around your town. Overall, a great game for all ages.
A12BBH1G8YDVAM B007NACZPI 5 1332460800 20 I love this game. its great for all ages!!!! I would also recommend bug village! its almost exectaly like this!
A12BBH1G8YDVAM B006QCMPWM 5 1326758400 21 I think that this is a great app! It has soothing music, fun fish and it is great for ALL ages!!
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B006GIX2MI 2 1362700800 22 Generic, sim city. Nothing fancy, maybe good for young kids. Definitely glad it was free, not something I would spend money on
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B0086700CM 1 1362700800 20 Daughter downloaded this to my Kindle telling me it was &#34;soooo much fun&#34;, she lied. I hated it. Very boring
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B007PW1BRC 5 1362700800 20 We actually pass this game around as a family. Lots of fun.I would totally recommend it to anyone and everyone
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B009KS4XRO 3 1362700800 21 It's good for when Facebook is down and you can't get into the actual game. I play it when I'm bored.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B0060I3IJG 5 1362700800 23 This is another site very similar to Pintrest. Again it's great for looking up crafts, recipes and anything else you can think of.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B0069F2RCE 4 1362700800 24 Good for when you can't log into Facebook to play the actual app. Good for times of sheer boredom. It's poker plain and simple.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B004DM1OAQ 4 1362700800 22 Another good app for kids and or beginners. I loved it and play it often. I was surprised considering it was free.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B008FC58ES 3 1362700800 20 I liked this app. It would be good for kids and or someone just learning how to play the game.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B008JJS6D2 3 1362700800 20 Yep it's a free app, nothing fancy just a basic game of Bingo. I don't think I would recommend it.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B008GTV9DO 4 1362700800 20 No matter what app, if it's uno it rocks. Great game play. I would totally recommend it.The kids love it.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B008N8IV2U 1 1362700800 23 This game is horrible. If you're into frustratingly banging on your screen in hopes of finding the right spot more power to ya.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B008NCUFYS 3 1362700800 20 Mind numbing. Ball dropping with no real point to it. It reminds me of the game from Price is Right.
A12BDQUE67KQ3G B005ZFOOE8 4 1362700800 20 I like this app mostly because I can use it at the gym and don't have to buy an iPod.
A12BEARTS7C10 B004U75OYG 5 1346025600 40 i LOVE this game! there is a board game version of this game, which  i have been pleying my whole life, and this is exactly the same thing!  this app is awesome!!!  if you dont have this app,  GET IT!!!!!!!
A12BEARTS7C10 B007ZGO7EM 5 1345248000 42 i love &ccedil;alculator plus!  it works so well and is soooo easy to use!  no problems or complaints at all!  and the best part is is that its free!  i would definetly reccomend this app to my friends snd family!  : )
A12BEARTS7C10 B00769WNK8 1 1346025600 21 it is just horrible. its just annoying! i mean, i was just like  uugghh the whole time. it just plain sucks
A12BEARTS7C10 B00DEG4Z1W 1 1372032000 39 this app is terrible. do not waste your time getting it. its hard to control and you have to unlovk stuff using real money. if you want a really good hair salon game i recommend toca hair salon 2.
A12BKC0G03724F B00700QXFE 3 1338163200 28 its ok I mean the controls work horrible. when you press the jump button you don't jump so what's the point of three cars if you don't jump??
A12BKC0G03724F B007693VXG 1 1338076800 21 pimple popper is dumb i mean wants too pop pimple for a couple in romance????? Well it is also soooooooooooooooooooooooo discusting
A12BKC0G03724F B008J1ZVRY 4 1341964800 22 great game I have not seen the movie but the game is awesome but it is a little touchy In the fingering
A12BKC0G03724F B0086700CM 5 1338076800 24 up down slide monkeys wow all packed in one game! I love this game explorers running from evil monkeys who want to eat you
A12BKC0G03724F B004SVMNXY 5 1338163200 26 I mean mantel it shut down my kindle and I had to wait for the battery to run down but most of the time it also
A12BMLBEI1CJ1U B00CK8W77Y 5 1395273600 26 I like slot games and this app is another favorite of mine. Graphic is good, easy to play and I give this a 5 star rating.
A12BMLBEI1CJ1U B00H343YNQ 5 1396656000 27 I recently download 1. I really enjoy their slots. Great variety to choose and play. Hopefully I will find time to play the games at least once.
A12BMLBEI1CJ1U B00GGQLZUG 5 1395273600 23 I love slot games and this is among one of my favorite apps. The games are great to play and easy to access.
A12BMLBEI1CJ1U B008878MQQ 5 1398643200 21 I like this game. Provides entertainment that keeps me playing. I would recommend to my friends. You will like this game.
A12BMLBEI1CJ1U B00D57N4O4 5 1395273600 21 I am not good at bingo and usually never play but this app is different and keeps me on my toes.
A12BMLBEI1CJ1U B00DG8N78A 5 1394668800 22 I like playing slots and sure I will enjoying Tourney Slots. Poker is my second best and love Black Jack  and Richer.
A12BNSLLLXWZCM B009XFDFPU 4 1362441600 37 this a great game to wind down with,relaxing music and as always with a simple stratedgy it becomes addictive. one of the better apps and for free does not deserve any critism, get it and enjoy it.
A12BNSLLLXWZCM B00846HN02 5 1404777600 65 This is a great book, large colour photo's of what the end result should look like, very clear instructions with loads of recipes, probably the best I have had to date if you like grilling this is the &#34;Daddy to have&#34;, it covers poultry, beef, lamb, pork, sides, veggies and a lot more, the more I delve into the book the more I like it.
A12BPPYUJQRU4G B009C7JS14 5 1384214400 23 I just need my local weather information on my tablet. This one works for me, though it provides more information than I needed.
A12BPPYUJQRU4G B007GE0X3M 5 1382313600 20 It gets news from many newspapers. So it gives a good coverage of news in the world. I like it.
A12BPPYUJQRU4G B008M87GJK 3 1382313600 20 The software works smoothly. But I don't get the all the news in the world. It is better than nothing.
A12BPPYUJQRU4G B004TI2ZXY 5 1389571200 26 My son install this app for me. I only used it once. It appears to be accurate. But I do not have much experience with it.
A12BPPYUJQRU4G B006PJ3UKC 3 1382313600 22 I get limited news from it, not as many as the newspaper. It is good, better than nothing. I keep using it.
A12BR0KKFQTEYY B00ANH526W 4 1377820800 72 I have really enjoyed playing the game, however, the diamonds is a real issue for me. I understand the reason the app is free is because they charge you for diamonds but the items are too expensive. Also, you go through energy too quickly. I don't even have time to complete the BIG challenges because I'm constantly refreshing my energy. Overall, fun and totally appropriate for the ages of tween and up!
A12BR0KKFQTEYY B00FEMJF6O 5 1389052800 28 I am extremely ashamed of how much I love this freaking app! My only problem is alliance's, they're either always full or no one wants to join yours...
A12BRZYM9C1KPV B005HSL626 4 1362268800 30 This is a great game to play when you need to kill a few minutes of your day. It can be a little addicting to slash all that fruit, though!
A12BRZYM9C1KPV B004VOJT0I 3 1362268800 20 I know this is the free version, but I wish there were more choices available when you search something specific.
A12BRZYM9C1KPV B0094BB4TW 4 1362268800 41 This is a pretty good facebook app but sometimes it doesn't refresh when I ask it to, and I know I have a notification. I wish it would sync with your kindle to tell you when you have a new notification.
A12BRZYM9C1KPV B00AOF15V4 3 1362268800 39 Not all of the options were explained to me, and when they were it took so long for the tutorial that I just got bored with the game. Otherwise it's fun once you learn how to use the app.
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B004M6B1NI 5 1371427200 65 Me at my age, have alittle trouble, getting to know these new things.  I am getting it; but again, at my age, I thought about sticking to the old ways,,,,but my smartphone is teaching me different..  My husband well ask, what are you doing?  My answer, going to work, I think I've got it.  :)  I love seeing all these new deals and coupons,  thanks
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B004VMUS9G 5 1383523200 22 I have so many alarms, you would think I was apart of the  fire department.  This one has never let me down...
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B00FAPF5U0 5 1384300800 26 Watch out, when you start this game, you want to finish it..I even have my husband playing.Great game  5stars all they well let me give you.
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B004YF1LLY 4 1375228800 44 Everything was great, but sorry: when I seen the Kinde; I wanted that, I am a spoiled brat as you know...I got thisandroid without research.  It really isn't bad but I wanted more, and the latest was Kindle.....Again sorry but I speak the truth.
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B00DHKKN6Q 5 1400198400 24 challenging the mind is a great work out.  easy for kids and adults,  it kind of warms the heart to keep the game going
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B00HTYNMWS 5 1395446400 21 My husband put this on my tablet also, in order to play games all day, if it's rainy.  He loves it.
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B00D57N4O4 5 1375228800 46 Since most of my work is done, at home, sometimes I need a break.  That's were Bingo Vegas comes in, it helps on really bad Mondays &#34;you know the days&#34; , it helps me unwind.  I really like this game and It's Fun To Have around...:0)t
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B00ICS67BS 5 1393372800 20 the whole family loves these seek and find.  we love going up against each other, to find out who's smarter
A12BSJRDCCLMKT B00JTKDTLE 5 1400198400 22 this helps with hand and eye challenge's  it's easy to get started but hard to put down.  great for kids and adults
A12BTCEJR90D4U B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393804800 28 best game ever it is great for kids and adults and its really fun to play u only have to rate the game to get all the birds
A12BTCEJR90D4U B00G5LQ5MU 5 1386979200 31 I love it it is great for kids. any. age if u rate. u get a free hint even if u rate it on facebook and its not hard or easy
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B004SJ3BCI 5 1359331200 23 I am sure I am not telling anyone things new... Gotta love this game. Even the free version is well worth your time.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B007XKEY6Q 5 1357430400 44 I love to play Draw Something every night! I even purchased the full game, it was worth it! I only wish More of my friends would play! Some of the people can draw really well! it is fun to see what they do next.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B00AB7HESI 3 1378684800 41 I love the idea of this game but wish it didn't guide you so much. I can think of some really inventive ways to solve the problem but can't make the item. Also getting the right size item is very hard...
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B006N1K1AE 5 1332806400 26 So cool to watch your every move mirrored. My favorite thing is to write names in landscape then turn them upright. Drawing pictures is also cool!
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B007DKC922 5 1332633600 21 little addictive, doesn't seem natural to let any of the bugs live, even if they are strapped with bombs... Love it!
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B00AAX68HG 4 1359331200 88 Not as addicting as some and the first page of levels seems too easy. I guess i will see if it gets more challenging from there!*edit: Okay may be slightly more addictive now that I have played it a while. I am going through an getting 3 stars on every sub-level. Some of them do make you think a little to get all three. If you get all three stars, on all sub-levels it opens a new sub-level in each "story" that actually makes you work for it.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B0086700CM 4 1355270400 21 Crazy and addictive! Touch controls on the Kindle Fire seem to not work from time to time, which is very frustrating.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B007KQ6XYY 5 1374624000 28 My son and I both Love Om Nom and cannot leave him sad without his Tasty treats! This is a great continuation and as addictive as the original.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B008UZ00TI 4 1376006400 35 My son ran into this app at best buy. It was on a laptop and kept him busy while we searched for what we wanted. I got this as soon as we got home =)
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B006PHD0RW 5 1357171200 59 My 6 year old got Bag It! Lite pre- installed on his Nabi 2. He LOVES it! I was helping him one day and found it to be pretty addictive myself. I always have to get 3 stars and the ribbons before moving to the next. I had to buy the full version! Still have LOTS left to unlock!
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B009HQ9UHC 3 1355270400 70 I loved Angry Birds but Bad Piggies is a bit hard to get the hang of in my opinion. Trying to build the machines to get to the end is pretty easy, getting everything in the level.... Not so much. I have yet to figure out the physics of the game making it possible to launch part of the machine into the air. Worth a try since it is free.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B007P8BMTS 1 1391817600 151 We have become a streaming household so things like hulu plus, Amazon Prime and Netflix are our life. I downloaded the CW app so I could watch vampire diaries or supernatural in bed. When I did I was so unpleasantly surprised.... On their web site CW streaming has no commercials, I guess they had to make up for it somewhere because this app gives you 4 to 5 commercials for every 7 minutes of show.... To make matters worse you are watching the exact same commercial or variance of commercial  four times in a row.... On top of that, one of them was interactive. Meaning it sat on a screen until I touched it.... I didn't know what to do I kept waiting for it to go on by itself and finally I tried touching it. Bad form CW.... Bad form, even Hulu has less commercials, and that is saying something.
A12BUKR6ZSOMXT B009G1J62C 3 1357171200 43 Bad Piggies is just not as good as the angry birds franchise. you have to build carts and get the pig to the finish line. Building is limited and getting all the surprises in the level is a big pain in the tushy.
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B009LT1YZ6 2 1361318400 96 running this on an HTC incredible ii ... the controls really just don't work. there seem to have been similar issues (but gave it a try since this was the FAOTD). has lots of potential but it's too frustrating in its current state. for some reason there's no consistency in which way the fish moves when the phone is tilted in any direction - and that was just the 1st level. this is more than just a learning curve issue. I'd say save your money unless you're on a device that's been positively reviewed multiple times.
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B005KN7NQ6 3 1360713600 83 My son is 18 months old - he loves this game. I'm sure he'd give it a 5. (he's also &quot;completed&quot; several levels since the bus will eventually drive into the correct letters accidentally.) BUT - I always run this in airplane mode. there are links all over the place that go directly to the Amazon app store. why, oh why are you nagging for ratings in an app aimed at preschoolers?? it also needs a child lock to prevent accidental exiting, etc.
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B006GIX2MI 2 1360022400 68 This was a FAOTD ... it runs fairly smoothly, graphics are good, gameplay is ok if slightly repetitive (and a lot of time is spent waiting - for money to accrue, etc). however - every time I turn my WiFi on it starts itself. it will be listed as a cached application, even though I haven't opened it in weeks. highly suspicious &amp; a huge waste of memory.
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B008Y212PI 4 1381536000 37 The interface - in particular the automatic scrolling is a bit annoying. They also require a review or a fb &quot;like&quot; to unlock bonus puzzles. all in all not bad (this was the FAOTD) but not fabulous.
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B0099S2HAK 1 1363478400 63 For the folks pushing 5 star reviews &amp; complaining that others are giving poor reviews for in app purchases - in app purchases have to be disclosed in the description. I only let my son play games in airplane mode, but if you don't know the potential is there and your child buys a few hint packs at ten bucks a pop ...
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B00BJRH6HS 3 1371081600 57 This is ok. Extraordinarily easy one you figure out the rules. Was the FAOTD today ... not sure it's worth a paid download. Perhaps if it wasn't constantly attacking you with annoying pop-up ads! Rate me! Download our other games, they're free! Literally had to dismiss 4 or 5 in the few minutes I had this running.
A12BUX6HKC7DIF B00885MDHM 5 1343779200 62 giving it a 5 to counter all the 1's. glad I actually dl'ed this. the oft-mentioned ads? it's a splashscreen. I really don't take issue with a splashscreen. it's a clever game - mix of tangrams &amp; a slider puzzle. simple but it's free today, &amp; my son will def enjoy it in a few years. really good for teaching spatial relations.
A12BXBSA6DUZQ8 B00AOF15V4 5 1405123200 63 This game is extremely fun and addicting. An amazing app to pass the time. Pick up a game full of excitement against your friends and family. Play a quick game with a few computer controlled opponents. Even go online to play against other players over the internet. This is one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire HD. I highly recommend it.
A12BXZZD71ASZF B008XG1X18 5 1379894400 21 I love pinterest. I always find helpful recipes in a pinch! I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Hope this helped
A12BXZZD71ASZF B007S16X4Q 3 1379894400 26 This game is okay.  I was looking for Chictionary, but it was not available for my kindle. This game was not a good replacement for that.
A12BY8SE46SBKU B00BFUUMO8 2 1398729600 24 Not an easy game to play. It takes to long to develop a game plan. Graphics are ok, to good for the slow game
A12BYC7ZHOZ1KS B00ELV0WF2 1 1383436800 21 has vegas scoring but not vegas rules other solitaire games are much better at what they do and do not do
A12BYC7ZHOZ1KS B004SJ3204 4 1383436800 23 It's kind of hard to see the peg board and who's winning.  Other that that it plays quite well, especially when its free
A12BYC7ZHOZ1KS B00FYHXMQS 3 1383436800 21 hard to maneuver on a kindle.  Maybe it's just me.  I'm a new user and still learning about the kindle fire
A12BZHQKW863E0 B00DYY92MG 4 1375488000 20 This app is fun and really covers a wide range of shows! It's challenging, but not impossible. good luck! Enjoy!
A12BZHQKW863E0 B0085YOD1A 4 1371600000 34 Easy to use, gives good infoI downloaded it as a free app of the day and it's very helpful, especially when I was traveling because it gave usage time as well as battery level.
A12BZHQKW863E0 B00BPC23XO 4 1374537600 38 This is a good adult time-waster game that still uses your brain. It's best as a pair or small group game and, I imagine, would be very good for children as they often make associations adults do not.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B00FEMJF6O 5 1394928000 26 I didn't think I would like this much but it's actually a very cool storybook type game. I like it very much!I'd recommend this to everyone.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B0094FYBB6 5 1382572800 32 I just love this game! Definitely recommend this to anyone who likes word games. I've actually learned a lot of words I didn't even know were actual words. Download &amp; have fun.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B0091REZMW 5 1379894400 54 This gives the appearance of being difficult. I personally feel it is challenging but LOVE the variety of items. Each room has several items to find so even if you have found them for one challenge, later you can play the same room to find others items. This is one of my favorite games.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B00BMK357W 5 1398211200 36 Definitely recommend this game. It starts out slow and gradually increases it's speed, gets your blood going so you become more alert. I like to play in the morning to get adrenalin going for the day.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B00A4EZ3QS 5 1387238400 30 I find this to be a relaxing fun game. I usually don't play timed games, didn't even realize it was timed til I'd been playing it for over a month.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B00GY0PQZ4 5 1389657600 30 Absolutely love this game! Great for building vocabulary, which is why I prefer word games over others. Definitely will recommend this game to friends and family! Download and start playing!
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B00D4EBQ3E 5 1390348800 22 It helps get your mind working and helps learn more vocabulary. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone at any age.
A12C1H4JH2M6E8 B00D2XD5JU 5 1379203200 37 This is the best one that I've played so far on my Kindle Fire!I love it!  Although it is fast paced, it's not too fast. Thank you foranother great free game! I definitely recommend this for anyone.
A12C56NESVH3LA B007BFSYMS 5 1365552000 28 Comes preloaded with lots of sounds.  So, regardless of what you need a sound machine for, you can probably find the kind of noise to suit your needs.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00HA8WNZ0 4 1397606400 35 The premise is simply to connect little icons with lines.  However, it takes a bit of logical reasoning to successfully solve each puzzle.  It's quite fun and engrossing.  I recommend you give it a try.
A12C56NESVH3LA B006OOHYIC 5 1363910400 34 Finally a game that makes you think!  It is so much fun to work through the deceptively simple puzzles.  You can easily waste moves if you don't think ahead.  The music is so relaxing.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00H1MDH3W 5 1402272000 71 This app will allow you to choose your city, or put in your latitude and longitude, and presents you with a labeled map of the sky.  It is coordinated to the local time so it constantly adjusts to show the current sky picture.  You can rotate the map to orient it to the direction you are facing.  It also includes lots of information about the stars, constellations, history, etc.  Highly recommend.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00ET47USI 5 1404086400 28 A nicely designed, easy to use interface for Spider Solitaire.  Easy to read on a 7&#34; Fire HD.  Gives some additional options for game play and color schemes.
A12C56NESVH3LA B006P2Y2QK 3 1371427200 27 This app is OK.  Just not the best solitaire out there.  I would recommend you compare it to others and see which interface you like the best.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00CDV6WDS 4 1375228800 22 A simple game that is nicely executed.  Easy to see on the 7&#34; Fire HD.  Quick response and the music is nice.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004RDFDEO 5 1357516800 20 A well executed app.  Operation is easy to learn.  Lots of fun.  Al Factory makes some good apps. Highly recommend.
A12C56NESVH3LA B007K8RFJ4 5 1376870400 97 This little app is a great tablet based remote.  Has all the same functions as the Roku provided handheld remote, plus the benefit of a keyboard when you need to type in search criteria, etc..  Must be paired on not only the same wireless router as the Roku device, but it also must be on the same band.  So, if you have a dual band router and have the Roku on the 2.4 Ghz WiFi band, your tablet must be on that same band for the app to be able to communicate with the Roku.  Highly recommend.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004OG7XY2 5 1357516800 45 Operation is easy to learn.  Game Board and pieces are well defined and easy to see even on a 7&#34; Kindle.  If you play the computer be prepared for a challenging opponent.  It has some ads but they are not obtrusive like some free games.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00ETADXY2 4 1389657600 34 A fun &#34;line of the colors&#34; game.  Not too different from other games of this type though.  Game play is smooth on the Kindle Fire HD.  Images are plenty big enough on the 7&#34;.
A12C56NESVH3LA B007VUA7VO 5 1356739200 29 Top notch app.  Shows how much time you have left for a variety of functions.  Really like how you can have it appear in the kindle menu.  Very convenient.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00ELOOYZI 4 1383523200 29 Its a neat app.  The physics content is a bit more involved than I would have imagined.  It's really quite a learning tool about basic rocket and space science.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00E6Z0THE 4 1396828800 120 This app is the &#34;find clues, pieces, and parts and use them later to get more clues, pieces, and parts&#34; kind of app.  I've not finished it yet, but so far it has been fairly intuitive.  It takes notes for you and has a broad map that only gives you details of the places you've already been.  It also has a fairly detailed hints section that can give a lot away if you don't use it carefully.  Just start at hint # 1 in each section and only go the next hint if you have definitely already done the  action noted in the first hint. Otherwise you can spoil your own fun.  The graphics and music are very nicely done.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004DLNC4I 3 1358380800 34 This app seems to be well executed.  Regrettably, only one channel is available for my area.  If I want to listen to radio traffic in other places it seemed to work pretty well though.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00CWY76CC 4 1404691200 26 A fun diversion.  Not too complex, so if you're new to the &#34;gather items&#34; types of adventures, this one would be a good place to start.
A12C56NESVH3LA B0055SWM08 5 1375228800 27 Well executed.  Images, music, and game play are all great on the 7&#34; Fire HD.  Starts out simple and builds to extremely complex puzzles.  Loads of fun.
A12C56NESVH3LA B008B80ZGW 5 1357516800 37 If you need some background noise this is the app for you.  Comes with several different nature sound tracks.  You can loop them continuously, if you need it to run all night to drown out hotel noises.
A12C56NESVH3LA B008K6HN8I 5 1357516800 90 If you are used to a PC type file interface this app will help you feel right at home on the Kindle Fire HD.  Without it, it can be a bit challanging to find files and folders on the device.  This app lays everything out in a very easy to navigate file structure.  Makes it so easy to load my own music from my PC on to the device.  Allows you to see the properties of all the various files and apps you have.  Pretty handy, I highly recommend it.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004DM1ZQY 4 1380153600 51 Nice game so far.  Plays through quickly because it shows you your possible moves.  I hope to find a setting to turn that function off.  If you are just learning to play it's a great feature.  But if you already know how, it seems to take away some of the challange.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00JND1LQW 4 1400198400 34 A nicely produced game featuring logic puzzles with gravity as the common element.  I haven't finished the game yet, but so far it's been fun with some puzzles being rather challenging.  A good diversion.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004RCUJ9E 5 1376870400 28 Had the free version with ads.  When this came up as the 'app of the day' for free, decided to ditch the ad version.  Good game.  Well executed.
A12C56NESVH3LA B008R5RGAC 4 1371427200 40 Not sure how necessary this app is for an android tablet, but it does make you feel a bit more secure.  Updates weekly, and automatically scans or can scan on demand for malware.  So far it hasn't found anything bad.
A12C56NESVH3LA B005ZXWMUS 5 1371427200 28 A must have app for NetFlix subscribers.  Works well on the Kindle Fire HD.  Sound and image quality are quite good.  You can check your que and search.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00EEDJHXA 4 1388361600 35 Simple game that can be a lot of fun, when you don't have much to do.  Haven't gone through many levels yet, but so far, it seems to keep your mind occupied for a while.
A12C56NESVH3LA B0087SGWI6 2 1371427200 21 Wasn't what I was looking for.  Perhaps others might find it enjoyable.  Can't hurt to try it, as you never know.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00AA0TJO8 5 1389052800 76 What a great idea.  Draw your own character to lead through a series of adventures.  I don't always know if I've covered all the little things in each level, because you can sometimes stumble upon the exit to the next level.  You can certainly go back to a previous level, but you must sometimes accomplish some things to get back through it.  Haven't finished it yet but so far it has been a lot of fun.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00J3AW23G 4 1405123200 27 A fun little logic puzzle app.  Connect the pipes together to complete the plumbing system.  Not too complicated, but it's always fun to successfully solve a puzzle.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004KU2JZU 3 1357516800 20 Has potential, but the cards and playing surface are too small to use comfortably on the 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004GYY714 5 1371427200 56 I've had the most fun just exploring all the stations.  There are so many from all over the world.  Over the air as well as lots of internet only stations.  If you like anything radio; music, talk, discussion, or just listening to evening drive time radio in London, you've got to give this app a try.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004MC8CA2 3 1371427200 22 If you always have internet access when you will be using it, it works just fine.  Without internet access, not so much.
A12C56NESVH3LA B008IJT0CE 4 1371427200 26 Still getting used to how to use it best.  Lots of sounds to pick from.  Allows you to mix sounds to create your own unique blend.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00HLT6JQM 4 1394150400 129 Like the previous &#34;Cryptic&#34; adventures from this developer, Cryptic Kingdoms is a fun app with a story to participate in, and puzzles to be solved, in order to continue the story to its completion.  While I certainly enjoy puzzle games, the puzzles in these particular apps become increasingly difficult to solve to the point of unsolvable (at least for my feeble mind).  To a point where even viewing the walkthrough fails to reveal the logic behind the solution to a particular puzzle.  While you can certainly continue after viewing a puzzle solution, not understanding how that solution was reached takes away some of the fun for me.  Of course if you can't solve a puzzle for some reason, you won't be able to reach the end of the story.
A12C56NESVH3LA B004EBZX6W 5 1356739200 48 I was amazed at all the conflicting signals from neighboring routers.  This app helps locate the least busy channels for my router.  Also it can help you to visualize the dead spots in your house.  Sometimes just relocating your router can eliminate the dead spots.  Very useful app.
A12C56NESVH3LA B00GI8AMI8 5 1405123200 20 A fun mystery, pick up stuff, solve puzzles, and move through various rooms and areas on the grounds.  Nice graphics.
A12C56NESVH3LA B0066T8SDU 5 1369526400 41 Really fun.  Plays like the real board game.  Play against 1, 2, or 3 computer players of selectable degrees of skill.  Or play against online players.  Lots of settings.  Highly recommend.  You can also pass the game around to other players.
A12C56NESVH3LA B008FC58ES 5 1356220800 21 Great fun.  Just learning the game.  My learning curve is flattening and my skill is improving.  Thanks for an exciting diversion.
A12C56NESVH3LA B008HSOT18 5 1363910400 30 Great fun to play.  The graphics really enhance what could be a very bland solo game.  If you enjoy the board game, you will have a ball with this version.
A12C5FF12NAQ10 B0085PEG16 1 1390348800 29 I am using the Kindle fire HDX. I can only play this game for five seconds before it automatically takes me back to the main Menu for some reason.
A12C6T4QV4SEKJ B00AEORXR0 5 1367366400 24 wow you can play and play on this all you want it I just like a Phon and it is awesome there's nothing bettter

A12C6T4QV4SEKJ B00BLS2U6M 5 1364342400 29 this game is awesome because its Hollywood the best place on earth cause all the L'ouverture stars live thee and you get to see them and its motive stars
A12C6T4QV4SEKJ B00DRA55DW 5 1375142400 23 best game ever in history I love it and u should to temry it awesome right I know I can never staple ll
A12C8UJZWBQ2IK B00CJ95O2E 1 1389830400 32 Battery saver told me I had more that many hours of standy by time...more that Kindle, but the battery ran down after a few hours. I had much better performance without it.
A12C8UJZWBQ2IK B004T2P7MQ 5 1360800000 22 A partner to my computer...it is great. I would recommend to any user. Easy to use and good information to have close.
A12C8UJZWBQ2IK B0062R5GJ0 3 1356048000 20 Sync was $40, plus a $10 discount. Would not buy again. We need a better product. Four more words needed.
A12C93253F6YME B008IXP8IU 5 1351728000 27 this game is very addictive. I played the free levels and have bought more since. its nice to have a word game without a timer or points.
A12C93253F6YME B007SPQ04A 1 1341532800 41 I played for almost 35 seconds and woke up 4 hours later in the emergency room. it seems I was put into a boredom induced coma. doctors say I will make a full recovery but I have to delete the app.
A12C93253F6YME B00D1A1F50 4 1380067200 23 its hard enough to keep you interested but easy enough to still have fun. one of the best riddle apps I have played.
A12C93253F6YME B007ZGO7EM 5 1346198400 36 I have tried a few other calculator apps and this one is the best. it fills the whole screen and its easy to use. if you have a fire and need a calculator, get this one.
A12CDTNRPSI8SE B00CMF27DE 5 1371859200 22 I have to say that this is one of the best if not the  est Bingo games that I have ever played.
A12CDTNRPSI8SE B00B2TET3C 4 1371600000 18 The basic game is funThe buyables are ok price woseOverall it is a good game for all ages
A12CN239SWGFO4 B0064X7B4A 5 1362096000 33 Great app! plenty of free coins, could play all day! Plus can play with your friends online. I like that it shows you if it's your turn for their other games games too
A12CN239SWGFO4 B006KX3GXO 4 1358899200 27 I really like this application. It has a lot of different options and choices to do with your photos. It is very easy to understand and work.
A12CN239SWGFO4 B00A4KVFLY 2 1362441600 82 This games is fun, but you don't win coins when you win rounds;  takes forever to up a level,and when you do you don't win much.  Plus you have to get the exact wording for answers or it doesn't give you the points. After you play so many times you get the same questions. It's fun fora every now and then game but not everyday. Won't let me sign into Facebook either :( big family feud fan this game was a disappointment.
A12CN239SWGFO4 B008JJS6D2 5 1358467200 31 I like this app more than any of the other bongos because you get 5 seconds to double check your cards before the times up. Very fair and easy to understand.
A12CN239SWGFO4 B004SIIBGU 3 1363219200 45 I don't like that I can't look and do some of the things I can do on their normal site, but there is a spot on the app to choose to go to the official site, but by then why not just use the web?
A12CN239SWGFO4 B0064X7FVE 5 1377993600 39 This is a perfect weather app for anyone who just wants to be able to quickly check the forecast with or w.o all the details. You can put your zip in and it gives u a very accurate report.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B007T8BYWE 3 1397001600 36 I was kind of disappointed with this set.  The puzzles are very easy and there aren't very many puzzles in this set.  It's alright but if you want something that's more challenging pick a different set.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00EEDJHXA 5 1397001600 170 I was surprised at how much I enjoy this game.  It starts out pretty easy but gets pretty challenging as you advance.  It seems so simple and the concept is simple but it's a lot of fun.  The first time I played it I couldn't put it down for hours.  I really like that it has an undo button if you make a mistake.  I don't know if it's me but it's easy to make a mistake, sometimes I think I touch the right button but it doesn't take or I think I wipe to the last button and it stops before that.  It doesn't happen very often and doesn't affect game play since I can undo the move.  I like it and recommend it, if you like doing puzzle games and there are a lot of puzzles to do so you won't work through all the puzzles in a few days.  You really get your money's worth on this game because you'll be playing it for a long time.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00HA8WNZ0 3 1402099200 112 I liked the idea of this puzzle but I quickly got frustrated with it.  The challenge is to connect all the objects without crossing over another line.  They throw different objects into the mix where you have to connect to them 2, 3, or 4 times even if you can connect all the objects without doing that so they change the parameters of the game.  If you're going to make a rule stick with it.  It quickly became too difficult and too frustrating for me so I only played a few sections of the game before I deleted it and found something that was a challenge but didn't take so much energy.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00768WTXA 3 1360368000 28 I really liked this game, it was a lot of fun but I was done with it in an hour.  I wish there would have been more puzzles.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00A9JG6RS 1 1358899200 90 I really liked the game play but it doesn't last long until you either have the choice to pay or not play.  I think maybe I got to play the game for about an hour and I was out of lives and the only way it would let me continue is if I bought more lives.  I did not spend cash on this game because if it's asking for money that quickly it's only going to get worse as you progress eating up lives faster and faster.  Total game scam.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B009RLG7RI 3 1397001600 143 I really like the puzzle aspect of the game and wish there were more puzzles to do.  I dont' care about the village aspect of the game, it's pretty basic and boring.  I don't understand why they included the village part of it.  I'd think most people who get this get it because of the puzzles.  I like the special features you can earn, it's great that you don't have to buy things to win or get thorugh a puzzle.  the puzzles start out easy but get challenging but so far not too challenging for me.  Some of the other games from this company the puzzles get so challenging I can't get through them so I end up deleting them and get angry I bought them.  I was worried about this game but got it anyway and so far I'm really enjoying it.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00FWPWNKS 4 1405382400 303 The puzzles would be pretty easy for the most part if you had unlimited time or unlimited moves.  Who wants easy?  It's very challenging and keeps adding more challenges as you move up the levels.  Sometimes I get frustrated with the puzzle and have to quit and come back another day but it's fun and not impossibly difficult.  It was fun to discover all the powerups.  if you create 4 chain you get a jelly jar which will clear a whole row or column when matched up with 2 matching fruits.  If you connect an L shaped by 6 fruits you get a double fruit that when it's matched up will clear out a 3x3 block then another 3x3 block.  When you match up a line of 5 fruits you get a rainbow flower that you can match up with any fruit and it will get rid of all fruits of that color, if you match the rainbow flower with a jelly jar it turns all of the fruits into jelly jars and clears all of the rows and colums for that color.  If you match the rainbow flower up with the double fruit it turns all the fruits of that color into double fruits and clears a whole mess of spaces.  if you match a rainbow flower up with another rainbow flower it will clear every space on the board.  I've only been able to do that once.  You can also match any color jelly jar with any color double fruit to clear a super block of squares.You'll do yourself a favor if you practice making powerups early in the game and try to mix them together so you'll be used to doing that when it gets more difficult because at the higher levels you cannot win without using several double powerups.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00CX713IG 5 1391212800 90 I really liked this game, it had a lot of interesting pics, and had a decent amount of levels.  I would have paid for this game if I needed to.  I like that there are 3 levels to each location and I wish I could buy more levels with the same game.  I tried to replay the levels thinking it might change the objects but it didn't change.  I would have liked it more if it would have been a little more challenging but it was still fun to play.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B007N8RULO 3 1391212800 144 I don't really believe the random layout is really random.  When I play this game with real cards I win much more often, there seems more like there is a pattern to the random deals, a pattern to make them unwinable.  I like this game and it is not easy, sometimes I can play quite awhile before I win a game.  I really hate the stupid ads that op up after every deal and some of them do not close, when you go to close them they take you automatically to a new site and it's a pain to get back to the game.  If there was a paid version of the game I would pay for it just to avoid the ads.  I've checked out several other spider solitaire games and this was the best of the lot, but it's still only OK.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00J3AW23G 4 1405382400 173 I liked this simple puzzle version.  I couldn't play it very long at time because it got too boring but it was fun and i wish it would have had more levels.  I'd gladly pay for more levels if they were available and not expensive.  I learned more about the game by reading the reviews than id did from the game itself.  Like you can lose points if you don't use up all of the pieces but sometimes they do have extra pieces available that you don't need.  I didn't like that it was inconsistent like that.  There was one puzzle where a pipe just ended at the edge of the puzzle which seemed wrong because in all the other puzzles that was not allowed.  I struggled trying to find the correct placement of pipes for that puzzle then finally out of frustration I gave up and used the hints.  I do like it that you can use the hints as often as you like and you do not have to buy hints.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00ATSBIIG 3 1358640000 149 I like this game it was fun and challenging.  I did not like where the piece selection place is.  It is often difficult to pick up pieces especially during the speed round.  I got so frustrated during the speed round because my finger would bump the start menu.  I also did not like that I could not scroll through the pieces.  I have finished the puzzles twice and still can't get into the bonus puzzles.The game does not always save my play so I have to start all over.  VERY FRUSTRATING.  I am sorry I paid full price for this game, it would be a good free game but the overall performance is not acceptable for pals game.  I feel like if I pay for it should work as advertised.  It also uses up a lot of power and it is very slow moving going from screen to screen.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B009XFDFPU 5 1369267200 181 The game is easy to learn but gets challenging, it took me awhile to figure out how to clear more spots and free up the board, I'm not great with reading instructions and understanding what they're talking about but I was able to figure it all out by playing the game.  I like that you can keep replaying a board until you get through it.  I also like that you can go back to the beginning or another spot and replay a section to get more experience.  The basic game is the same throughout but the boards change so there is a lot of variety and a lot of games to play without feeling like you're playing the same board over and over.  The game does get very challenging.  I did not get bored with it.  The game is sensitive enough that it picks up my finger touches in the small spaces but I think it would be easier to play with a stylus pen. You can play as fast as you want or take your time to plot your moves.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00C2YR3XE 4 1391212800 26 It's your average hidden objects game, nothing special.  It would be nice if it had more levels, I went through it quite quickly then deleted it.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00EXVZW6E 3 1388793600 50 I kind of liked it because it wasn't just an average hidden object game it had other stuff going but the picture and objects were to small to really enjoy it.  If they would have made the play area less intricate, detailed and tiny it would have been more fun.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B005TB7TRC 2 1391212800 31 I was expecting this to be more like the real casino slot machine.  It was pretty boring to play, maybe if they added a bonus round it would be more interesting.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00G5LQ5MU 1 1391212800 126 This was in the hidden objects section of games so I thought it might be interesting.  It might have some hidden objects somewhere in the game but I couldn't even figure out what I supposed to do or how I was supposed to play it.  It put me in a room and wanted me to escape by looking around to find a route of escape or who knows what, in that sense I guess it's a hidden object game since whatever you're supposed to do is hidden from you.  Not my cup of tea.  I just wanted a plain old hidden objects game where there is a list of things to find on the screen, then after you find them you go to the next screen.
A12CNEHGD0IKC B00683JK9K 3 1360368000 105 I like the puzzles but I have a difficult time picking up the pieces sometimes I have to try 3 or 4 times before I get a piece to move from the side to the puzzle.  I don't know why it's a problem on this game when I don't have that kind of problem on other games.  I got it for free so it will be fun to play until I get bored with it.  I'd like to play the timed puzzles but no way since I have so much trouble picking up pieces.  Since it's free I shouldn't complain.  I wouldn't suggest buying it.
A12COC44UTU0S2 B004UMLBCA 3 1370736000 25 Too hard to get this cleared so I'm doing what they are asking.  Hopefully this will unlock my app so I can use it again.
A12CPWARP4LXDE B00529IOXO 5 1326844800 29 text plus is great I love it because when I'm on the go I take my kindle fire out go to the app and text my family and friends
A12CPWARP4LXDE B004T2QZL8 4 1332806400 23 this is a great game, I got this for free app if the day but 2.99 ain't. worth it......please lower it for others
A12CPWARP4LXDE B006D1ONE4 5 1333843200 26 if u got a kindle fore or have one this is so fun good people ages 8-12 so get this it is awesome oh ya get
A12CRRHDR4561Z B00846GKTW 3 1344729600 26 the game is fun but they need better descriptions for things because some are way to hard. gypsesy girl? sucks. ok appboring game to get money.
A12CRRHDR4561Z B0070O973K 2 1331769600 20 I wanted to try it butbi deleted it rigght away because it was stupid but it was ok but boring
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B0086700CM 5 1354492800 29 THIS was a NEW one to me and takes a BIT more skill and coordination than &#34;Angry Birds&#34; etc,  but VERY enjoyable and super well done.  GET this one!!
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B0052AZJV8 3 1354492800 37 Had to call APP Support on this one.  Got it installed with help from support.  SET up is a NIGHT MARE!!!!  NOT at all like the PC...It works... just Pack a lunch and a LOT of Patience.
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B006WQ9NJU 5 1354492800 24 Great App for the Foodie.  Actually had to call support and clear my cache to get it to install, but its a GOOD app!
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B0094BB4TW 4 1354492800 29 A BIT different from seeing FB on a PC and takes some getting used to.. but over all not bad.  I would suggest it to people with Kindle products
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B006TH5I28 5 1354492800 22 Nice info to have.  Its as simple as downloading and installing.  The info given is clear and visual and easy to comprehend.
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B008K6HN8I 4 1354492800 21 A BIT complicated for a NEWBIE... but still more like a PC file explorer,  Worth having!  COULD be simplified a bit.
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B005V1N71W 5 1361836800 24 I enjoy this one!  Useful and well thought out APP..  Excellent ...really really well done.  Thanks so much for the work on this one.
A12CWSLGAC6TOW B004K4RY9M 5 1361836800 20 I enjoy this one!  I spend a lot of time with it when traveling.  Excellent ...really really well done.  Thanks
A12D07WO7DEL4C B004JJXVYK 4 1368748800 20 I like games but I think this one is more than i bargained for. I have to select the formats.
A12D07WO7DEL4C B00BNH81FU 3 1364860800 38 I love Better Homes & Garden recipes. I have them coming to me on the WEB everyday, They are fantastic but the Kindle has me stymied by what it requires. Must learn more to make things work .
A12D07WO7DEL4C B00CKW6FVE 4 1370217600 21 I love Tetris Blitz! I thought I liked Tetris but Blitz has it beat by miles. Lasers, quakes, multipliers and more!
A12D07WO7DEL4C B0064X7B4A 2 1375315200 41 This game requires more computer skills than i have at this time. I have trouble moving from one system to the next. I had a stroke over 10 years ago and I still am having some problems with eye hand coordination.
A12D07WO7DEL4C B004K4RY9M 5 1364860800 26 I would highly recommend this for anyone who loves wordsearch games. I can't stop playing this game. Just give it a try and see for yourself.
A12D1QX2R57QUH B00975HIYU 1 1374969600 192 This was one of the first games I put on my Kindle, and for a time it was pretty good. Sure, the different slots within the game are pretty much all the same game with different skins and music, but it was still a decent time-waster. However, sometime in the last week or so, it started throwing up an ad at the start, and then another one upon exit; annoying, but then, most free games have ads, even if most are less obtrusive than this.The real killer is that I noticed last week my battery was draining much more quickly than usual. I thought maybe my battery was going bad, then thought that another new arrival (Weather Bug) might be the culprit and almost deleted that, but installed a battery monitor (GSam) and found that it was this app -- Slot Galaxy -- that was staying active in the background and draining power. Oh well, there are plenty of other slot games that are as good or better, and that don't kill my battery... Slotomania, Kabam Slots, and several others. Good bye, Slot Galaxy -- you were fun until you got greedy...
A12D56W24KG0G5 B005FM77HW 1 1344384000 49 kindle should offer some support if they are going to endorse these products which are nothing short of spyware/virus......both my kids downloaded this app and it locked both of their kindle fires ad from what i can read its nearly impossible to get rid off.....absolute crap app......3rd world quality
A12D56W24KG0G5 B007TNQ7EY 1 1385769600 27 the game is fun but the controling is hard and so are ghe missions so i say no to this game because it is not too good
A12D7TNSXM94T9 B007PTJOV0 1 1360540800 119 This game must have been developed solely for the purposes of advertising. It advertises at the beginning, in between levels, it actually takes breaks to show you an advertisement.The game itself is incredibly simple, and nothing like the challenge of the Mario game it is based off of. The only reason I ever died, is because of the horrible controls. It's just nowhere close to being as accurate and responsive as it needs to be. It gets so frustrating that you won't trust yourself when jumping, as to where you'll actually land. It makes you appreciate how well the controls worked in the original Mario.Theirs no boss at the end of the dungeons, you just walk off screen.  Sad.
A12D7TNSXM94T9 B00CTQ6SIG 1 1377216000 25 Total in-app purchasing game. Waste of time unless you want to just throw away money.  Wish you could just buy it as a normal game.
A12DB856Q57Z12 B00881VLCE 5 1399075200 21 Nice size puzzles, easy to manipulate and beautiful subjects.  I am enjoying doing them on a daily basis. Keep them coming.
A12DB856Q57Z12 B005CRCP36 5 1330560000 38 I am addicted to your programs.  They always seem to fit the needs I have for the day.  I love having them so convenient on my Kindle.  They are a wwonderful way to start my day.  Nancy Phillips
A12DB856Q57Z12 B00FVVR2ZO 3 1394841600 57 It is,a dangerous game as the graphics are great and very enticing but the fact that you have to buy things in order to play encourages children to be deceitful  . They just get into the story and you can't go any further. I am enjoying it  but can't condone  the having to purchase things so often.
A12DCA36LVLBD B00DUGCLY4 5 1382400000 25 FUN for all ages... Only downside is there are not enough rounds in the game... After an hour or so playing the game is finished...
A12DCA36LVLBD B0066T8SDU 4 1366243200 64 I am absolutely obsessed with this game!!! I have met some really great people who will actually help me when I'm in a rut... Great graphics... The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it often freezes and will not let me update my games... Hopefully the developers will work on this issue... Otherwise you can't go wrong with this app!!!
A12DCA36LVLBD B00EBFKPAA 3 1376438400 20 Like I said, it's a simple and easy FUN game to kill time with...  Nothing special or anything...Have fun playing...
A12DEQQ9XM7TE3 B00HEFEDAM 2 1389398400 27 The game is boring. Typical match three with the added bonus of the blatant grab for cash. Not worth the price. And yes I know it's free.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B008NCUFYS 5 1399075200 196 I very seldom miss even one day without playing this game.  I like that you have ways to get more Paplinko balls without paying real money for them or without begging for them from your friends.  But, I have to wonder about the randomness (or lack thereof) of when your ball ends up in the green or purple slime.  My high score is 10,692,958 but now when my score gets above around 500 thousand, I hit the green slime.  I wonder about the randomness because if I fire the ball at the far left column and the green slime is in the far right column, my ball bounces around until it can land in the slime cutting my score in half.  Also, even when I have won a topper which is supposed to protect my ball from the slime, the ball hits the topper and keeps bouncing in the same spot until it breaks through to the slime so I'm not sure what purpose the topper is supposed to serve.  If the ball hits any other spot and bounces it almost always bounces into another space.  At any rate, this is still a seriously addictive game.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00EEDJM2Q 5 1403395200 51 I am seriously addicted to this game.  I like that I can play just a couple of rounds if I don't have much time or I can play many rounds if I have more time.  I also like that there are hundreds of rounds available even in the FREE version.  AWESOME!!
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00JV858HM 5 1401062400 80 I really enjoy this game.  I especially like that it allows me to move to the second and third section if I am unsure of section one.  By the process of elimination I am then able to go back and solve section one.  I HATE games where if you strike one snag you cannot move past that.  However, I wish the additional puzzles for this game were not so expensive.  A dollar for 50 puzzles seems a bit too high.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B008IXP8IU 4 1401148800 114 I am a serious word game freak and this game is awesome.  However, it misses getting five stars for a few reasons.  First, you have to figure out the words in order.  If you don't know one word you are stuck.  I wish you could solve the words you know and then by the process of elimination perhaps be able to discover the words that you find more difficult.  I have been writing all the letter combos on paper so I can mark them off as I solve word 2, 5 and 7 and then with what is left I can perhaps get the other words.  Seems this capability should be into the game.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00FIW5BZE 5 1402876800 27 This game is awesome.  There are a LOT of puzzles and I never get tired of playing it.  I also like that periodically there are new puzzles.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00GRTPZ3A 4 1394150400 48 I love the pictures in these puzzles and I am seriously addicted to working the puzzles over and over.  I sometimes have difficulty getting the pieces to move which adversely affects the final time required to finish each puzzle.  This is frustrating but I still enjoy working them.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00DHKKN6Q 2 1392768000 54 This is a cute game but I never could move up a level because I would always run out of time and I always ran out of time because I would have to swipe multiple times (like sometimes as many as ten times) to activate the bow.  Finally I just deleted this in disgust.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00GY0PQZ4 4 1395014400 26 I just got this but I can already tell that this game will be addictive.  I REALLY enjoy it but you have to do some thinking.
A12DF8QSZGWVBW B00ICS67BS 3 1399075200 52 This game had a reasonable number of levels (15) but the objects were very easy to find.  Also, I didn't much like the narrative in this and soon elected to turn it off.  The graphics were very nice and I can see that this game might have great appeal to younger children.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B00AREIAI8 5 1367539200 61 If you love horses, you'll love this app.  You get to feed, pet, compete, and many more with horses.  You also get to buy more horses.  I just started playing and so far I have not had to use my own money. But I have not bought a horse yet either.  I am enjoying the horse that I have right now.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B007HH3K5G 3 1339718400 36 I enjoy playing, but don't care for having to have energy to play.  it gets frustrating sometimes especially if you don't have energy.  you have to wait for more energy or until your neighbors send some.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B0086700CM 5 1339718400 26 I think this is one of the best entertaining, challenging and epic game in the world!!!  This will test your reflects.I recommend this game for anybody.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B0091REZMW 5 1368316800 49 I love playing hidden object games.  The only thing that I do not like about this game is that you have to have energy.  But then I would probably never stop playing.  I play til I run out of energy and then play again when the energy is refilled.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B00D9CNAOY 1 1373500800 51 I was able to download this game onto my kindle fire, but was not able to play it.  It would stay at the beginning.  I was able to pick which bee I wanted but that was it.  I am not very happy with game at all.  At least it was free.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B008Y2FRFO 5 1356048000 24 I found that it is hard to put the game down especially after I had put some puzzles together.  I enjoy playing this game.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B009OYOASG 5 1357689600 62 I gave this a 5 star because I did have fun with it, but I got bored with it.  My friend loves playing it and does not get bored.  Plus I found that I was too busy to keep up with the other players.  It was not fair to them.  I recommend it to others who love to play a game everyday.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B00IKZX1ZI 5 1400630400 29 It reminds me of Sugar Crush but with the Disney characters. I am already on level 54 and have had no problems.  Very happy with the game so far.
A12DGP4ZVB5HVA B00HY9UK28 1 1395360000 27 I did not like this game at all.  I don't know a lot of music so I thought that I would enjoy it but I was wrong.
A12DOCKO8520AC B006ON41FC 5 1329436800 41 Wow. I always look at the game of the day so I got this caus I had nothing to lose and I'm sure glad I did caus its my new favorite game! Get this game and you'll be glad you did.
A12DOCKO8520AC B006D1ONE4 5 1336176000 20 this is one of the most entertaining games ive ever played!!! I seriously. recommend. it!!! and the gaters cute lol
A12DOCKO8520AC B0070O973K 4 1335916800 66 If you think the game is so stupid why did you get it?? That's what the comments are for anyway!! And no there is no point to the game...BUT THATS THE FUN PART!!! If it said &quot;on the count of three polish the poo&quot; would that be any fun? Didn't think so. And if you hate it so much just delete it! It was free anyway!
A12DSE1NXRB4K B008KVSIT6 5 1357948800 22 I put this on my kindle for the grandkids, but find myself playing it all the time. Its a lot of fun.
A12DSE1NXRB4K B004V5PW4Y 4 1357948800 20 Fun and very easy to play, I like that you can play two players, now I can beat my husband.
A12DSE1NXRB4K B007PW1BRC 2 1357948800 24 you don't get to play a whole game it picks the level weather 4 or 5 and you just have to play that level.
A12DSE1NXRB4K B007Z4AKQI 5 1357948800 21 I was really surprised that the graphics were so real. My grandson loves to play it and so does my husband.
A12DUDD3IK34GS B00AMEYWYE 2 1365465600 42 The song is obnoxious, the animation boring and the interaction with the pets far too limited. I should be able to play fetch or some other interaction, take for a walk or let them go outside for a break. You lost me.
A12DUO6XWS7JY B0086700CM 5 1338595200 23 temple run is a great game and app I play it all the time it works wonderful. I reccomend this app to everyone
A12DUO6XWS7JY B00820STKI 5 1342915200 21 this app is so fun. I cant stop playing it. its unique. and colorful I say anymore cause it proves itself.
A12DUO6XWS7JY B004Q3CJQ0 4 1333929600 29 the tiny flash light oz amazing it provides light when you can not see and it even changed colors its fun and it is also recomended for all viewers
A12E1INDNFVT38 B0063IH60K 5 1378080000 28 I love this app.  Since I download I have not had a single problem.  It loads quickly and easily and it keeps me entertained even without Internet service!
A12E1INDNFVT38 B00CNT8KW6 5 1374883200 33 I love all slots, but this one is especially fun!  It loads quickly and runs smoothly!  I tell all my friends about this app!  So much fun!  Love it!  Love it!  Love it!
A12E2PF7C18GDR B004GYVYV0 4 1326931200 186 Previously, Mr Dutton said this app would not allow bi-weekly recurring incomes. This is not true. When setting up an event, simply indicate the recurrence as "2" and the frequency as "week", and then set a start date. The app will then indicate the next event date and you are all set.From what I see, this is a very full featured app, although the previous reviewer was correct in the comment about only allowing a single level of sub-category. As long as that is the level of control you need, this looks like it will perform well for your needs.I only just started checking it out and so do not have extensive experience yet, but those who have long term experience really seem to like it. It is feature rich but not entirely intuitive. It is also not as bad as some of the reviewers would have you think.Give it a shot of you need something like this. From the revision history (goes back to initial release) in the app, it looks like the developer has put a lot of thought and effort into this product.
A12E2PF7C18GDR B004UHSB5A 4 1329868800 164 Samsung 4g touchMenu &gt; Information = help, for those who don't know how to play. (only problem there is a repeated sentence)Game play is straight forward, ends that add up to multiples of 5 get points. First to run out of tiles gets points.AI will turn tiles for you.When dragging tile to location, look for glow on the tile you are connecting to and then release your tile, otherwise tile will return to your hand.Game keeps going until either you or the AI reaches 250 or more points.When tiles are played and locked between end points, the locked tiles get smaller to conserve screen space.Generally a well done game. Only thing I had never seen before was where I placed a double 6 at the end of a line and the AI placed a double 2 up against it to score points. If this was a legal move, I was unaware of it and it caught me off guard.Game play is intuitive and fun.
A12E2PF7C18GDR B0090YHSFC 5 1353024000 88 a nice and challenging game, no excessive permissions to worry about, and enjoyable as a time killerwould like to see some kind of indicator that lets you know what percent of the floe has to be sliced off, as you can't tell how much more to cut to complete the level you're onreasonably well done and kids can enjoy it as much as adults :-)reminds me of an old game where you had to capture balls in small areas to complete levels, but don't recall its namegood job
A12E2PF7C18GDR B0073LWDZ4 2 1328313600 86 Conceptually it looks like fun, but graphics keep flickering on the next room to move into, and the game locked up on second level.Instead of going immediately for the exit, I had to spin the room a few times before I could get to the coin, and then the controls completely quit working. It didn't force close either. I had to hit the home button and then shut down the app with the task manager.Running on galaxy s2, rooted with EL29.Fix and I will try again.
A12E2PF7C18GDR B007JM4CWY 1 1337731200 126 Except for the permissions, this would get a five star rating.When I went to shut down the app, I couldn't even make it Force Close. I had to uninstall it to make it let go of my processor!The only apparent reason for the network sockets-full internet access is if you want to share your scores somehow, but if not, why does it have to lock it's control?Finally, I tried to block it's access with Droidwall and then it wouldn't even load. Just a black screen.Get rid of this kind of control! It makes me fear that some hidden process might be data mining my personal information, let alone my preferences.I wish Amazon would preview their FAOTD before allowing this kind of program to be disseminated.VERY DISSAPPOINTING!!!
A12E2PF7C18GDR B007PF22WC 4 1350432000 180 The physics of the game play very well. If you go through the tutorial, and pay close attention, you will understand how to spin and adjust cue elevation. You don't have to pull back on the stick from where the cue ball is located, but from anywhere in the board.Adjusting your stroke is easy enough by simply adjusting how far you pull from the starting point on the board.The only small challenge was figuring out how to get out of the tutorial and into game play. Using the LEFT arrow at the bottom left of the screen solves that and then you get to choose your style of play with challenge or match play. I pressed forward with challenges which was helpful in learning the board controls.I would recommend only two improvements. 1) Add a help file to explain the board navigation. 2) Improve the drain on battery life as passing through 15 challenges and the tutorial session used about 35% of my battery and my Galaxy S3 got warm in my hand.With those changes, this would get 5 stars.
A12E2PF7C18GDR B0061S0A64 4 1334534400 98 After letting it play for awhile and tapping and sliding around, I then selected the menu, while music was playing, and the app froze on my screen.  After tapping the back button a few times without any response  I figured I would have to do a manual reboot, but just then the whole screen blanked out.AI was getting ready for a long press on the start button, the screen returned, telling me the system ran out of resources and the app should Force Close to resolve the issue.All said  though, a fun app and relaxing to play with.
A12E3F65U2WP4T B00CKW6FVE 5 1375142400 22 I have always loved the game of tetris and this puts it in my hands right now.  It is fun to play.
A12E3F65U2WP4T B00B2W1RSY 5 1369958400 22 I havn't played this game yet but know I will enjoy it when I do.  It looks like a very interesting game.
A12E3F65U2WP4T B00D9SC4TA 5 1375142400 20 I got this for a young friend who wanted to do something on my kindle fire.  She loved the game.
A12E3F65U2WP4T B00D2XD5JU 5 1375142400 20 Once again I got this for a friend and she had fun playing it on my Kindle Fire.  Thank you.
A12E3F65U2WP4T B0081JPTXK 5 1375142400 25 It is fun having a game that has a variety of games to pick and choose which ones I want to play at that time.
A12E3F65U2WP4T B00CAW96DI 5 1371254400 21 I am enjoying this puzzle and plan to get back to it soon.  I love the digital orders to my kindle.
A12E3KAR41GDYA B00H343YNQ 5 1390348800 36 Lots of fun easy to play I wish I could find these slots at the casino's I go to I play slots in NJ and Delaware wish the bonuses where bigger so I could play longer
A12E3KAR41GDYA B00HYL0AAI 5 1394755200 33 This is. A great game has alot of fun bonus games it keeps you wanting to play try this it is really fun the higher score you get the more challenging it becomes
A12E3KAR41GDYA B00IG63BVK 5 1392681600 25 Having lots  of fun good payoffs just wish the bonuses paid a little better but all in all it is still a lots of fun
A12E3KAR41GDYA B00IU61TPQ 5 1398470400 24 Great game lots . Of bonuses  good pay offs and my grandchildren love it l tell them the stories of the games we play
A12E7Q9K93AZ9M B00HDRTGDK 3 1391299200 25 Fun game, but would really like if it could connect to Facebook like it says! Would also really like  as free hint like Androids app.
A12E7Q9K93AZ9M B008194C74 4 1337904000 44 When I saw that this was the FAOTD I got it thinking it wouldn't be that great...well I was wrong! Its a fantastic, different game and I can see it keeping me very busy! Finally something that is not the same, boring puzzle game!
A12E7Q9K93AZ9M B006SMLAMQ 2 1332115200 21 Didn't really care for this app at all. It did not have GPS capatability! Couldn't even find my hometown, I uninstalled!
A12EAUQGKGUMMO B006OC2ANS 5 1330473600 29 I love this app just downloaded and already on 3rd tourtament this hard and easy at the same time I lose to some guys and win against the rest
A12EAUQGKGUMMO B008KMAJQU 5 1364688000 31 This is one of the best zombie games ever it is amazing and I love it  best game because I can play with my brother in the same game on multiplayer
A12EJQH0DWFLX5 B009XFDFPU 5 1404604800 11 Have went through all the levels twice now.  Love this game!
A12EJQH0DWFLX5 B00AREIAI8 5 1359590400 23 Downloaded it just to see what it was like.  Would say check it out for young girls.  For a free game it's great!
A12EJQH0DWFLX5 B007N5YIUS 5 1361059200 21 This is a fun game to play if you need to kill time.  Have it on my phone and my kindle!
A12EJQH0DWFLX5 B00C149WAM 1 1385337600 24 This app is not really free.  You have to sign up for something or pay 99 cents for the app or it doesn't work.
A12EMPQK3G5MEO B00B2V66VS 2 1359158400 31 I liked the game until it force closed on me. It has done this to me 6 times to me allready. I liked the original version better.  No wonder It's free!
A12EMPQK3G5MEO B008183CTE 4 1344384000 24 I really like the game but had 2 take off 1star because it needs a wi fi connection so I can't play it on-the-go.
A12ENBT314RFXR B0088P2A7A 5 1384905600 72 Excellent app for my KFire that works without crashing! Just like mobile view of wikipedia, but in app form. It does have annoying pop-ups that prompt you about opening wiki links in either your app or the web, but you can choose a preference to prevent it from happening with each link clicked. Beyond that minor issue, no serious complaints about the app. Would recommend to those who like to browse wikipedia.
A12ENBT314RFXR B008XG1X18 5 1361750400 96 If you love Pinterest as much as I do, you will love this app. It's so easy to search and pin things using the app that most of what I do on Pinterest is done from this app just because I prefer this layout and interaction to what the website provides. I enjoy Pinterest as much as the next gal, and this app lets me take that with me. I'm not sure if this is a good or a bad thing, yet, but I'm definitely enjoying this app! Go for it, you will not be disappointed.
A12ENBT314RFXR B007HBA70S 3 1361750400 108 I haven't 'beaten' this game. I don't really know if you can. I do know it's one of the most pointless games I have ever played. I usually bust this app out if I'm looking to kill boredom or am wanting to fall asleep.Many of the games are painfully similar to one another and the lack of story line is quite comical at times. I know this isn't trying to be a serious game, so I don't hold it against the app too much, but I did hope for something a bit better than this. I still play the app though, so it must be doing something right.
A12ENBT314RFXR B008245WE0 3 1361750400 104 While the app has a good amount of features - the ability to increase or decrease the sound and the rate of rain - I wish it provided a bit more depth. I know it's just rain, but maybe rain at the ocean or in the forest or jungle?The visual aspect of the app is nice, and can let you escape your current reality and just think about rain, if that's what you're into. I prefer the sound myself.Nothing spectacular about this app, but I do enjoy it from time to time and I think it makes a nice addition to any app collection.
A12ENBT314RFXR B007U8JRWW 5 1361750400 71 We stumbled across this app by chance and thought it would be amazing. We were right. We have found an underwater spring, parking lots, beaches, mountains, roads, and various other things people put cameras on.Every time we check this app out, we find different things to watch and think it is really neat to be able to view people and sights from around the world without leaving our living room.Highly recommended!
A12EP4SNDOZHJP B008AZGWYK 3 1360195200 25 what it is i guess its ok, don't use it that much thank goodness no need for it.  but what i used was really good
A12EP4SNDOZHJP B004TBM4VY 4 1356307200 24 should have a help or hint button or rate the ease 1hard 2 medium 3 easyeasy.  otherwise this is a great free product :)
A12EP4SNDOZHJP B007MRQOXQ 4 1360195200 20 very helpful and i love my kindle, the games email facebook google of course books favorite is words with friends
A12EP4SNDOZHJP B004W7Z14W 3 1360195200 21 for what it is it is ok, i don't find it all that helpful i found somehting else that i use
A12EP4SNDOZHJP B004I744AS 5 1357084800 22 Tells me how to say the word in addition to the definition!  Uses the word in a sentience to help me further.
A12EP4SNDOZHJP B00636V5CM 1 1360195200 21 i thought it was a product i could use and could like, well it was nothing what i thought it wsa
A12EQ7AFJ2J2ZP B009HKL4B8 5 1378944000 49 its awesome I love this game I make my friends and family and I'm making my neighbor but never do the woohoo its so gross the woohoo never do it but other then that its a lot of fun so I would get the game if I were u
A12EQ7AFJ2J2ZP B007JPG04E 5 1331856000 20 its great! You get to shoot people and stuff and buy upgrades, etc. All around a great game. Awesome. Amazing
A12EQ7AFJ2J2ZP B00CKW6FVE 5 1372291200 52 When I saw the game availability I wondered how they would handle the piece placement on an Adroid device...I am happy!  Its a great game and I like the Power -up options, but wish you could buy them with earned points. Burned and delayed meals already because I don't want to stop!
A12EQ7AFJ2J2ZP B00CZDSK7K 5 1379980800 29 I love the game its awesome I actually use the clock so that I can get the money faster its awesome so I say u should get this game
A12EQ7AFJ2J2ZP B00BNH1PF8 3 1367971200 26 Nough said :)All ages will be able to play the levels available here. Haven't timed out yet so I'm not sure what happens with the bomb?
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00KSOQ66K 5 1404777600 28 I enjoy the variety of games on this app.I play this on the PC and was glad that I could download it to my new phone. Very fun.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B009WJNXAE 5 1387065600 40 Bingo Bash meets exceeds expectations. It has a lot of variety, and is challenging while still allowing wins to earn credits, etc.  The monthly or so special they run with unlimited power ups really helps to  allow &quot;marathon&quot; play sessions.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00E5GJ7QS 5 1384905600 24 This is an enjoyable game.  Seems easy to get rewards and bingos.  I will like playing this as a change of pace from others.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00D57N4O4 5 1389484800 25 This is a good bingo game.  The daily bonuses are plentiful and useful, so you can earn credits easily to allow you to play more.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00E8KLWB4 5 1390262400 42 This is a pretty good game - there are lots of levels so you don't finish it quickly.  It's a little confusing at first, but the longer you play, it makes more sense.  And you can keep advancing without spending real money.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00CH26TL8 4 1393977600 49 This is a fun game to pass the time.  I don't like that you can't earn many &quot;boosts&quot; to help when you get stuck - instead you're expected to buy them.  So, I just play until I run out of lives and then come back another time to continue.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00DG8N78A 5 1386806400 26 I had trouble at first getting it to connect to Facebook, but by chance tried again today and installed an updated version, so now it's working.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00GXH3TGG 5 1399680000 54 This is a fun game on Kindle.  It's slightly different than the PC Facebook version, but it has its own little bonuses and challenges that keep it interesting.  I doubt I'll ever use the loyalty points as they are, so it would be nice if they allowed you to trade them in for chips.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00B2TET3C 5 1372809600 38 I enjoy playing this game and like that it has a cat theme.  I wish you could earn more credits playing the slots in order to trade for power ups, but the daily bingo credit feature is nice.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00AMEFZ72 5 1383004800 22 This is a good slots game - you get enough coins to start to get going and win enough to keep playing.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00BMW6ER8 3 1394236800 139 I do like this game and play often, but it does move a little fast - only allowing about a minute and a half for 2 cards and you have to click for the next ball if you have no matches.  But, while you can add teammates for weekly bonuses, you are playing each game independently, so you can usually get at least one bingo (3 per card and then it goes to a blackout bingo) if you're fast enough.  I can only play 2 cards at one time on the kindle -I'm not coordinated enough to scroll through multiple &quot;screens&quot;.  It's a nice game to play if you just want something quick.  I have to say I've never earned enough on the daily free tournament to get any extra credits or anything.  Not sure how it is possible!
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00CMF27DE 5 1372809600 27 I enjoy this game and was drawn to it by the cat theme, which you don't find often in games. The daily credits feature is nice too.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B007TBAQCK 5 1384128000 23 Just started playing, but so far it is a good game with lots of bonuses and winnings without having to buy more coins.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00FVVR2ZO 5 1403136000 46 This is a nice hidden object game.  It's challenging, with a lot of variety, but it is hard to earn all the items you need for collections and unlocking new areas without buying tons of crystals.  So, I just play with the bare minimum for now.
A12ET2DDQGVHUD B00IKZX1ZI 5 1395446400 63 This is a fun game - it's not too hard and not always really easy either to complete the levels with decent scores.  And so far there has been no real need to purchase boosts or anything, although you can if you want to. (Unlike Candy Crush Saga where it is hard to complete some levels without purchasing boosts (which I avoid doing)).
A12EUEAWXBCUOJ B007U7BIO8 5 1355270400 20 This is a great product.  It has many places for different times.  I would tell anyone to get this alarm.
A12EUEAWXBCUOJ B00BWBHIUG 3 1391990400 23 it is easy and not violentit is something a three year old can play alone and you don't have to worry at all
A12EUQ6F7ZCJKH B006PHD0RW 5 1329177600 23 Amazing game its truly unique and one of a kind version of Tetris. I recommend  downgrading it!! As addicting as cut the rope!
A12EUQ6F7ZCJKH B0058VW36U 5 1326067200 32 Simply put this is one addicting game! Its very simple to play and great for any age. Runs great on any phone. Trust me buy this app and you wont regret it
A12EUQ6F7ZCJKH B005FNNIAG 5 1312934400 34 Simply put this game is amazing! A must have for all android phones! I highly recommend a phone with a big screen as it gets tuff controlling lots of airplanes on the htc hero.
A12EUQ6F7ZCJKH B004O3YGMC 5 1325808000 28 Great remote desktop client!!!! I hope the key board feature gets up dated, it doesn't play nice with swype. Also encryption would be great! Over all fantastic app!!
A12EUQ6F7ZCJKH B006M5A75K 4 1324512000 41 The game is great and runs perfectly on the galaxy s2. I think alot of people that gave it a 1 star is because they cant spell. Also the way the letters reload almost makes it impossible to spell a word.
A12EUQ6F7ZCJKH B006RAX9OQ 4 1327622400 32 its like fzero. I love it but the only problem is that the screen turns off randomly on the galaxy S II. Please fix this and ill change it to 5 *****
A12EVT0VGHL4LB B00689PMD2 3 1326844800 22 once u play it for 5 min u need food and to get food u need to give money.. not worth it
A12EVT0VGHL4LB B006S3HN6C 1 1328572800 22 works pourly. waste of time we need.tap tap revenge!!!!! even when u play this u can barely touch it.... not worth it!
A12EVT0VGHL4LB B007OXASB2 4 1338249600 30 very addicting unlike some games on the kindle fire this one is very well made don't like that u have to spend money for gems and dollars... not worth it
A12EVT0VGHL4LB B0070O973K 1 1330560000 34 are u kiding me!!!!!  I know that what it said on the description is what it does... but this game is the most stupedest game ive ever played!!!!!  not worth it at allow sucks
A12EZ42BB09D5R B008Y7SMQU 5 1353024000 50 fun exiting and time waster hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi Jo ii hi hi. suppl how r u I am Bob I'm doing this 4 hints! !!! I like chese how is my face hi I'm cool fools u r crazy for looking at comments
A12EZ42BB09D5R B006D1ONE4 5 1326240000 22 I had douts. about the app but I love it. best game ever I would suggest ittoa anny. one. worth the 99cents
A12EZ42BB09D5R B005HSL626 3 1326067200 27 fruit ninga is chunk but not worth 99cents for add free it frustrates me a little whit the bombs wry 4 spelling errors _____ thanks 4 reading
A12F1L7VJP13W B009VSW15Y 2 1377561600 36 I had this app for a long time, and it took really good pics. But then it started saying that it was not responding! I had to buy a new one, and that really annoyed me.
A12F1L7VJP13W B008N1V11U 4 1389657600 75 This game is my favorite game for the kindle fire. I got it on sale, and it has failed to disappoint me. If you have played arkham city, it is kind of like that. You can get cool gadgets in the store for not a lot of money, and money is easy to get. It is perfectly appropriate for kids. The only problem is flying. It is somewhat hard to control gliding through the air.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B00A3E2BVE 4 1385596800 23 I played this game on my brother's ipad so when I found out Kindle had a version I was stoked. I love it.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B004SJ3AXI 3 1381276800 29 As much as I like Angry Birds this one is not my favorite. The game plays well but I don't know some of the holidays that are on it
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B007VDWMQO 3 1378252800 22 This game is ok. I can't answer all the questions so that sucks but I can answer a good part of them.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B00HEFEDAM 5 1395273600 25 My 2 nephews and niece were playing this game on their ipads and I thought it looked like so much fun. It absolutely is too.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B00CRLSN4U 3 1378252800 43 This game was ok. Some of the movies were kind of hard to figure out I thought. I wouldn't mind trying it again though cause it like ends. Once you guess the last movie that's all there are which I think is strange.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B0064TVQ5E 1 1366329600 22 This game kinda confuses me. I can play it better on my laptop and I still don't really understand the rules completely.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B00DFW3818 1 1378252800 24 I probably don't like this game cause I can't guess the songs and that aggervates me. It's not like new stuff so be warned.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B0063IH60K 3 1378252800 25 I like solitaire so you'd think I'd like this game but not so much. It's ok so I kinda could have done without buying it.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B004SJ3BCI 3 1381276800 31 Same goes for this one. As much as I do like Angry Birds this one isn't my favorite either. I feel like it takes too long to master the different levels.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B008Y7SMQU 4 1366329600 33 Ok so this game is harder to play than people think. I thought I knew my logos really well but not good enough apparently. Its so fun to try and figure them out.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B009HQ9UHC 3 1385596800 28 I haven't actually played this game so I'm not really sure whether I like it or not. I will say this though my nephews seem to love it.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B007N5YIUS 5 1366329600 23 It's angry birds. I'm gonna love it no matter what. My nephews and niece like to use my kindle to play it too.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B004SBS8LA 5 1366329600 23 It's angry birds is there really any reason to not like it. I get frustrated with those stupid monkeys but its still fun.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B00A757EFW 4 1366329600 21 I've liked pacman forever so its just a bonus that now I can play it without actually going to an arcade.
A12F1OPZ17YHBS B005HSL626 5 1366329600 20 Are you kidding? It's fruit ninja. This game is my favorite game ever. My niece loves to play it too
A12F1W1RC78NMN B009HUB40Y 4 1392681600 22 I play this also quite a bit when I get tired of the other games and would definitely recommend it to others.
A12F1W1RC78NMN B00E9A656K 1 1389312000 31 No good. I removed it. Not interesting. I am not really interested in this game.  Not much to say about it.  Tried it and immediately determined it was not for me.
A12F1W1RC78NMN B00HEFEDAM 4 1392681600 25 I play it quite a bit.  Got tired of some of the others.  I would definitely recommend it for those who might find it useful.
A12F2BZKT0M325 B00IAQ3RJM 3 1405641600 45 I found this game confusing but easy to play.  The match three is very easy, but the story line is hard to follow.  I wasn't sure what the purpose or plot of the story was.  Maybe a little more intro to the game would help.
A12F2BZKT0M325 B00CK8W77Y 5 1394928000 24 If you like slots this is the one to get.  Play gamese and make new friends from all over the globe.  A number one.
A12F674OPT7WJA B009KS4XRO 5 1363046400 52 Still learning all the neat things about this game! Glad I found it-looking forward to many hours of enjoyment and challenges!!Have been playing for awhile and this is my favorite bingo game. Make sure you do the free tournament everyday - it adds keys-coins-bingos-etc. You can also ask for things you need!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00CMF27DE 5 1371081600 33 Just got this game. I am at level 6 so have many hours of challenges ahead!I will add to this post as I get to higher levels and get to advance to moreGames.
A12F674OPT7WJA B0081JPTXK 5 1359590400 23 Just started playing and enjoy the various slots and the daily free coins.  I am sure this will provide many hours of fun!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00FAPF5U0 5 1393200000 27 glad I loaded this on my kindle! having fun and see why this a hit.  I like playing bingo blitz and now will enjoy this game too!!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00B3WD78Q 5 1365292800 20 this certainly keeps me interested and a good challenge. would recommend this for hours of enjoyment! try it out! !
A12F674OPT7WJA B00A6GNC1M 5 1359590400 42 Never played much bingo but this game makes me want to keep coming back. I love the free 5 games and more tickets each day.  Haven't figured the power ups yet but look forward to learning the features as I enjoy playing!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00CH26TL8 1 1403481600 21 I installed and within 5 minutes of play and demand to pay to continue ~ I immediately removed from my device!
A12F674OPT7WJA B008Y2FRFO 5 1350518400 23 accidently downloaded this game but glad I did!  easy to play and doesn't take much effort to gain prizes or acquire more coins!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00IS87HYI 5 1403568000 22 challenging and doesn't make you spend money to move from level to level!  glad I added this to the games I play!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00DT4GRTM 5 1375833600 53 I just started playing this game. Decided to try it out after reading reviews. I do agree that it would be nice to get more chips to use.  However, you can build up "bank " and the game is lots of fun.  I would recommend that you give this one a try.  Enjoy!
A12F674OPT7WJA B008JJS6D2 5 1350691200 29 this is fun and very easy to play.  usually. play slots so this was a pleasant. surprise!  Don't have to buy coins ... you get more as you win.
A12F674OPT7WJA B00E5GJ7QS 5 1376697600 23 this is a fun bingo game.  just got a few days ago - easy to play - nice pace - try this out!
A12F674OPT7WJA B00AVGGYNA 5 1363478400 20 usually play slots but this bingo game is easy-plus you get free coins often. would recommend for hours of fun'
A12F674OPT7WJA B00CXBSYVG 4 1373068800 28 just started playing and I am impressed! I get free coins every few hours! still learning the game but I believe this will be a favorite for sure!
A12F6Z6UX7GYHA B007BSPOG4 1 1394150400 22 What's the point of having it on kindle fire HD if u can't call people.PLEASE FIX IT NOW OR AT LEAST SOON
A12F6Z6UX7GYHA B00CW6DAKC 5 1393286400 27 People are right it's very fun and addicting it's an amazing game for family's when you get in your own little world you can barely get out
A12F6Z6UX7GYHA B004SOR4H6 5 1393200000 20 I haven't really tried it yet but I'm sure I'll enjoy it that is y I'm giving it this rating
A12F72PRDKR0NX B00A3WTXQ2 5 1357257600 32 I take my kindle fire hd most places with me and if I have a long wait for an appointment, Happy Jump keeps me occupied.  Cute graphics and hours of fun :)
A12F72PRDKR0NX B0087TQYUG 5 1362096000 21 Love this game and I play against friends and use smart match. I'm totally addicted and play whenever I can :)
A12F9406V46HO8 B00F1XSETA 5 1389916800 29 This game is a lot fun.  Love figuring out the pictures.  Not too hard, at least not yet.  Makes you think and good way to keep your mind active.
A12F9406V46HO8 B00BL0I7WG 5 1388188800 66 This hidden picture game is great!  I lose time playing this because it is so much much fun to play.  The graphics are great and you can make this game as hard or as easy as you want it.  I would definitely get more games from Differencegames again.  Hidden pictures are my favorite type of games.  Lots of great scenes with many hidden objects to find.
A12F9406V46HO8 B00F24OV8G 5 1391644800 41 This game is a lot of fun!  Apparently, I know more logos than I thought.  So far anyway.  This is a good game to get you thinking and fun way to pass the time.  I would recommend this game to anyone.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B00HJ4G1MQ 4 1392508800 82 I love the graphics and so far the story line is good.  I am really enjoying the fact that you can interact with other characters in the story. One really nice feature is that if you are tired or just don't feel like searching for hidden objects just now, you can play  mahjong instead.  One drawback is the price, $4.99 for the game, but they do offer 150 amazon coins for the purchase so that is good.  Overall, I like the game.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B00I3D27CU 2 1393632000 97 I was intrigued with the game during the free period and even though I had to use hints more often than usual, the scenes and story were beautiful. Some of the hints were confusing. After I paid the full prices for the game, $5.00, it was very glitch. I have collected 5 changeable/morphing brooms so far and now I can't get into the back stage area anymore. I've tried the hint button and it takes me to the fire truck and I can't do anything.  I'm sad that I've already paid for this and been a disappointment.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B00ENTFFZY 5 1383177600 29 Nice story line. Great graphics. This is the first time I've played a Big Fish game and it didn't disappoint.  The hints were just enough when I got stuck.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B00HV0FBEM 5 1391040000 43 The game controls are much easier than on some of the other games. The graphics are good and so far it pays nice.  The game have me plenty of tutorial instructions to get started so I wasn't lost. I will continue to play.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B00E5MN3DU 4 1389225600 60 I started playing with the free game and it led to purchasing the full game and I did.  The game was enjoyable enough that I liked it, The puzzles were fun and the game is just creepy enough to be entertaining. It was worth the price.  The HOS games are visually beautiful and they don't repeat a lot of objects.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B0097GVJWQ 5 1383696000 43 This game has been great. It even have me a few scares.  It has a nice visual screen and most tasks aren't too obscure.  Sometimes, the button placement a makes you click on something you didn't mean to but overall a good game.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B00CWG9EUM 4 1386633600 21 I like the game and the creepiness of it. The play is good so far and it has kept my interest.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B0067QCC70 3 1396051200 92 The initial premise and scenes are beautiful. I think this game has promise but needs some updates by the developer.  The first thing that was difficult is that some hidden objects are UNDER the menu button and it isn't intuitive to look there. Many other of the hidden objects are in random places behind things.  The game doesn't play in an intuitive manner, as far as what a person would do our look at if they were actually in that situation so I won't be spending my money to buy this game.
A12F9VKF4NKI6A B0064X7B4A 3 1397088000 41 Ok. I don't like the new update. The buttons...arghhh, there aren't anymore buttons, just space. It is awkward. Also, they didn't fix the whole disappearing notes that tell you &quot;such and such&quot; isn't a word.  Not a fan of the update.
A12FA4P34M5686 B00BGDEK9C 5 1369612800 95 This game is great.  Very slick well-produced graphics, and fun gameplay.  And through the couple of hours ive played it so far, it appears you can advance in the game with just skill and perserverence, or choose to spend a little to give yourself an advantage here and there.  All freemium games should be like this.  Great job concrete.  Since i havent quite been able to afford a vita or 3ds yet, games like this help me feel better about the fact that I have to rely on my kindle fire for gaming right now.
A12FA4P34M5686 B006GWE5PM 5 1328745600 36 really happy with this game.  great graphics and fun controls.  if you like little sports games, youd be hard-pressed to find a better one.  was lucky to get this for free...its definitely worth a few bucks.
A12FA4P34M5686 B00636V5CM 1 1333756800 144 it is some kind of greedy fear-based corporate sleazy boardroom-scheming motivation (either on Amazons behalf or the companies that own the publications) that keeps customers from being able to buy just this version of the magazine, without having to also be a print subscriber.  I mean what other explanation could there be?  its really driving people crazy and ruining the kindle fire experience.  we don't want stacks of magazines in our house when we already paid 200 for a device that is supposed to conveniently eliminate that!  can the suits pleeease get their heads out of their arses on this?  they make a great device and great content and then render it useless.  reminds me of the early days of the Internet when AOL tried to charge by the hour for dialup.  fast-forward 15 years and that company has disappeared in terms of relevance.
A12FA4P34M5686 B005J80RTW 5 1336608000 94 this is simply the best word game on kindle fire.only suggestion for sven studios is to replace some of the more useless player statistics with either an overall rating (like how chess games give you a 1600 or whatever, based on how you've done from the first game you've played to the current session), or average placement (like if someone plays 3 games and comes in 3rd 4th and 8th, their average placement would be 5th).  this should be visible to other players so you can get an idea of your opponents' skill levels.
A12FA4P34M5686 B0089BPEZS 5 1339804800 21 the cable companies are notoriously greedy...in fact they are now being investigated for it.  that's not hbo's fault.  this app rules.
A12FADR2PO8087 B004SJ3AXI 2 1376697600 26 I have no idea on how to play this game. There are no instructions to explain this to me. I would like to get some help.
A12FADR2PO8087 B00CHNKJFO 5 1380758400 30 This is my new best game to play. I have a pinball in my basement and now i can play anywhere. The graphics are great. It is very authentic .
A12FADR2PO8087 B004DLNC4I 3 1380758400 24 I was hoping that I could get my local police district on it, but it is not available. I will use this app occasionally.
A12FADR2PO8087 B00IS87HYI 5 1402876800 23 I love this game. The graphics are done extremely well. I would recommend this to everyone. I enjoy this more than candy crush.
A12FC30G6CHKAD B004WPG1A2 5 1325894400 36 I have this on the kindle fire. I had no problems with it. this is one of the most creative games I've played and I love it. perfect for for the stratagist. I highly reccomend it.
A12FC30G6CHKAD B0064X7B4A 1 1373068800 35 Why can I no longer see how many points I get for a word why does it tell me stuff from a month ago these are all problems I had with the new horrible update
A12FCEFYYGNEYL B004O3YGMC 5 1325894400 262 I love this!  I was always miffed at hulu for not allowing their site on mobile devices unless you subscribe.  To me it doesn't make any difference if I watch it on the web or on my kindle.  But to get it on your kindle, you have to subscribe to huluplus.  Sorry, I'm not going to pay for a subscription and still have to watch ads.This app solves that quandry quite easily.  I can watch me some hulu anytime, anywhere (as long as I have wifi) and that makes me a happy camper.Setup was only the teensiest bit confusing, but really simple.  (they could do a better job explaining the security code autopopulating if you already have a google account registered).It really does control your computer which is just cool in itself.  I haven't delved into all the other stuff, but I do have a rather large collection of movies on my computer that i'd like to watch on my kindle.. and this lets me do that (without having to fuss with uploading to amazon's cloud which would be eaten by only a few movies anyway).  Cloud is great for music files, but not the bigger ones.And i imagine it will come in handy for accessing files... like retrieving my resume or emailing it though I wont be doing too much of that.It's the perfect APP for me!I got this on the free app of the day, but it is well worth $4.99.  Also, if you are like me, checking in on your favorite facebook game to do some 'maintenance' is plus!
A12FCEFYYGNEYL B00A4KVFLY 1 1389398400 103 I actually enjoyed the game even though I gave it a 1 star because there is no easy way to finish a game except if you actually have friends who play it.. and most people don't.  Fast money sucks when you can never finish it because you can't partner with random people and it requires friends... again, those friends who don't play and don't want to hear about a new farmville.If you like the basic questions, it's fun.  If you are looking for something competative, stab yourself in the eye with a spork... at least your eye is competing against a spork then.
A12FCEFYYGNEYL B009DCOU9S 1 1379721600 23 Do not buy... all based upon making you buy things with real cash.  Cannot complete without cash.  Love the concept, hate the implementation.
A12FCKYRPYJKF2 B0066WJLU6 3 1392681600 17 Pretty useful for you, and fast but I can handle it. I think in between.COOL! Get It!
A12FCKYRPYJKF2 B00992CF6W 5 1389225600 26 It's like omg! I never played it before, and it's fun. I got my mom into it, and I have the best game EVER!!!OMG!OMG! OOMMGG!! EEEEEKK!!!!!!!!!!
A12FCKYRPYJKF2 B00A4O6NMG 5 1390867200 25 It's a really good game and I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!! It's addicting! You should visit the 1st top island. I'm actually trying to copy  it.GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A12FCKYRPYJKF2 B00AIUUXHC 5 1401580800 23 It's awesome cause ya get to ATTACK!!!! And eat people off of land and in water.Sometimes u get to GO On LAND!! AWESOME,AWESOME,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A12FCKYRPYJKF2 B00B2V66VS 5 1405814400 31 I love the game cuz it is almost all free..some things up have 2 buy but it still fun!!!! I LOVE THE GAME GET IT OR ELSE UP WILL PAY!!!! DX
A12FEHYJOJZZRY B00FAPF5U0 5 1394755200 20 Simple, yet compelling. Different levels of play and different requirements to win in each level. Could play it all day.
A12FEWHX695QYM B004KU2JZU 2 1395532800 26 I may delete this because the ads flashing in my face are very distracting!!!!  I really like the game but get rid of the big ads!!!
A12FEWHX695QYM B004KSAIPA 5 1346284800 27 I'M NOT GREAT AT SOLVING CROSSWORDS. WITH THE HINTS IT MAKES IT EASIER TO SOLVE.  LOTS OF PUZZLES. EASY TO NAVIGATE. I LIKE THIS ONE A LOT.
A12FEWHX695QYM B007PW1BZY 5 1393545600 42 I love to play uno and was looking for something similar. I like to play against the computer so I thought I would try this game. I really like it. It is like uno but with a twist. I recommend it highly.
A12FEWHX695QYM B0066T8SDU 5 1327276800 40 Finally, they updated this app so you can play against the computer. I do not like to play on line. Easy to move around the board. Great dictionary to look up words. I spend hours playing. Really like this game.
A12FEWHX695QYM B00FEIX5OG 5 1385942400 29 I bought this game because I needed a change from other match games. this is a very challenging game with lots of different puzzles. it a lot of fun.
A12FEWHX695QYM B00FAPF5U0 5 1404172800 24 I'm totally addicted to this game. So much fun to play different puzzles. Not like you are playing the same game over and over.
A12FLCO2OKWNIT B00B63HT8Q 5 1402444800 22 I just love this little app.  No nonsense just usable good information.  It is so easy to find what you're looking for.
A12FLCO2OKWNIT B00599ZRSC 2 1353456000 132 Most of the apps I have downloaded work great.  Contract Killer is not one of them.  The game itself is quite fun to play.  The problems start when you buy some of the optimal add ons.  I have had to but things like body armor & a silencer twice, and then can't use them.  These add ons have to be purchase with GU credits, not money.  There seems to be no way to win these credits, so you have to purchase them with real money, (out of your pocket).  It's not so bad to buy something, but buying it and not receiving it is a bunch of crap.  It's a shame to put a basically good game out there to use for entertainment and then be robbed trying to play it.Contract Killer
A12FLCO2OKWNIT B005WVJGT8 3 1383091200 67 It could be a little easier to change some of the rules.  As a matter of fact it should have more rule options than it does.  There are many ways to play this game with different rules, but it seems it must be to hard to set it up to have a lot of changing.  It is a good variant of hearts and I enjoy playing it.
A12FLCO2OKWNIT B005ZXWMUS 4 1351987200 56 Netflix does a great job for me !!!.  Usually good video quality & sound.  The sound is so good that I sometimes find myself looking around to see if there is something else on in the room.  I'm not joking.  The small background sounds can seem to come out of the walls !!!! It's that awesome.
A12FLRX8F5CV21 B00CV5N5I6 3 1371513600 21 not for me but I recommend it for little girls. I do this sometimes just to have a little cheap fun.
A12FLRX8F5CV21 B00AXKPWSM 5 1371513600 20 This is awesome I just wish you could post videos to YouTube! Other than that I love the video camera!
A12FLRX8F5CV21 B0089DZSNE 2 1371513600 32 It was okay. Kind of stupid though if you ask me! Sounds like whoever gets this is a little desperate. I can't believe my friends made me get it. Such a waste.
A12FLRX8F5CV21 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1387756800 32 This is a fun game. It's challenging and you have to buy hints which I think is stupid. I mean, yeah, the apps free, but that's the only reason I bought it.
A12FLRX8F5CV21 B009HKL4B8 5 1373846400 21 Compared to the last version this is awesome! I like the new graphics and how more real it looks! Nice job!
A12FQ94NZO0AJJ B00CWY76CC 4 1378252800 77 I have cognitive impairment from a brain injury and wanted a game to help increase memory and logical thinking. If you have played games like this, this one may seem relatively simple, but this was my first time and it really made me think ahead and use my memory. I was thoroughly entertained and look forward to getting to the higher levels. One con: wish it would offer the option of a hint to keep you going.
A12FQ94NZO0AJJ B0073LHCCS 4 1352246400 76 Cool, fun twist on a word game.  You have to interpret their clues to guess a word and each word uses the same letters but adds or drops one. You are also timed while doing so. Some clues are easier than others, but I find it to be a fun challenge.  If you choose to, you can play the same puzzle until you solve it and you don't lose the portion you have completed. Try it!
A12FQ94NZO0AJJ B006JPS1OM 5 1325030400 21 this a clever game. objects are difficult to find since they blend into background. I like the other tasks to complete.
A12FQ94NZO0AJJ B0064X7B4A 5 1365638400 40 After suffering a brain injury in a car accident, it was suggested to me that I try this game to help my cognitive impairments improve. I play it every day and have even chatted with people...would recommend this to anyone.
A12FQV5X37LNPZ B00CMF27DE 5 1368921600 45 This game is very cute and fun! Way to go on another great game! The only thing is that you shrunk the amount of gems for bingo and gem spaces, and I would like to see the six hour wait rather than the twelve hours.
A12FQV5X37LNPZ B00A37XD90 5 1378944000 48 This game is fun, but very time consuming. I enjoy the under the sea aspect of the game. Like all the other games like it there's not enough energy or gems. You can buy gems but with real money. I would like to see a legitimate free game.
A12FQV5X37LNPZ B00B2TET3C 5 1368403200 30 Love that you have to collect items! I have played as a guest and logged into Facebook it seems that I have better luck when I play as a guest.
A12FTBGW8XL0BH B006P2Y2QK 5 1364342400 42 If you love a simple,  functional game of solitaire,  this app offers that and then some. Very simple and easy to use. Customizable and pretty, this app has achievements, and offers  everything one might need for a fun game of classic solitaire.
A12FTBGW8XL0BH B00CTQ6SIG 5 1375056000 24 Very cool game. Nice effects,  and generally a fun pass time game. If you like the Simpson's you will love this game. Nice job!
A12FTBGW8XL0BH B00CH87HF4 4 1376092800 34 This game is addicting and fun. It has good graphics,  and is well made...Nice going Gameloft! You guys haven't disappointed me yet. The controls are a quirky for me,  but that's my only qualm.
A12FTBGW8XL0BH B009HV8ULE 5 1365120000 43 I first encountered this game on the apple store from my itouch,  and was in love with it instantly.  Its eye catching graphics,  and simple yet fun animated gameplay won me over. It tickles the little kid in me. Nice going Get Set!
A12FUSV9RDTAG8 B0067QCC70 5 1327968000 37 I had been looking for a object finding game. If you enjoy those type of games this one is for you. It even has a story line with it. This is a great game and its free.
A12FUSV9RDTAG8 B006ON41FC 5 1329436800 32 I really enjoy this game. It is fun and entertaining. I keep trying to collect more nuts to purchase things. I like that feature. Getting it for free is just a plus.
A12FUSV9RDTAG8 B009PSV1HE 5 1351814400 26 I was excited and pleased to see that they created Diner Dash for Kindle Fire. It is a great game that easily passes the time away.
A12FUSV9RDTAG8 B006U0Y07I 5 1327968000 27 I love how this game allows you to zoom in and out while searching for objects. This is a fun game that comes with a story line.
A12FWEMIN2APLL B00AMR1HZ8 4 1383868800 29 It took a few rounds to figure things out. Too bad individualizing the players is so limited! Otherwise, it's a fun, fairly authentic way to get your WoF fix!
A12FWEMIN2APLL B00BUR9KJE 5 1383955200 75 I am so glad I got this game! My Yahtzee box hasn't been open for a few years, but after playing it on my Kindle it brought back all the fun. The best part is not having to have to do the math. It took a few rounds to figure out the score sheet:what you already had and what you had to roll. Once you have that down, it's just like playing the box game.
A12FWEMIN2APLL B00FAPF5U0 5 1401321600 45 I gave up playing in the bed at night for Lent, but now that it's over it's back to late nights playing. I do the 3 challenges in lieu of paying the 99 cents. The bad part of that is the 24 hours between challenges.
A12FWEMIN2APLL B004NELBPC 5 1378771200 27 This is my go to app for what the hot topic of the day is. Then I come across other newsy things I wasn't even looking for!
A12FWEMIN2APLL B00COVCV50 5 1378771200 29 The fact that the easy and more difficult puzzles come up randomly probably adds to this games engagement-you don't know how much brain power the next puzzle will take!
A12FZ7RKYHZQ0Y B006QEN088 4 1355961600 101 As an rpg fan, I was pleasantly surprised to find this little app. I was even more thrilled that I can play it without wifi. Its a nice way to keep myself occupied for an hour or two, at least until my batter runs out in my tablet lol. I haven't gotten too far into the game yet but from the looks of it it is exactly as the title says, to advance along the map you do a bunch of mini quests to kill monsters and/or collect items and talk to npcs. The navigation is very easy to figure out.
A12FZ7RKYHZQ0Y B004UBB1HQ 5 1355961600 144 I specifically bought an android tablet just to be able to read comics at my leisure, and I was very happy to find this comic book reader app right off the bat. It automatically scans your tablet for comic book media and displays it nicely for easy access. It bookmarks where you left off in the comic and will even mark the comic as finished when you're done reading it. This app gives you a couple of choices on how the comic is displayed and how the pages are turned. For me, all I have to do is tap the screen and its on to the next page. Because I have a 10 inch screen I have no trouble at all reading the words, although if I need to I can pinch the screen smaller or bigger. I give this app two thumbs up!
A12FZ7RKYHZQ0Y B0075AJ3O2 5 1355961600 47 All I can say about this wall paper app is WOW. There are so many beautiful images, from anime, to fractals, to scenery, to artsy stuff and more. I think the only complaint I have with this app is sometimes not all the images want to load.
A12FZ7RKYHZQ0Y B0063GORYU 5 1355961600 65 I am a spider solitaire addict! I play in no less than 4 suits and I have a win rate of 95%, but I'm bragging lol. I was so very happy to find this app for my tablet so that I can play spider when ever and where ever I want, at least while my tablets batter lasts :D Awsome app, thanks for making it!!
A12FZS6DJZRG1T B008V06NRU 5 1402531200 31 my kids love taking care of their potato. has been a lifesaver when I need to entertain them in waiting rooms or when I just need a few moments of peace.
A12FZS6DJZRG1T B0057J06HQ 2 1359072000 23 entertained me for a little bit, but not enough to keep it. i didn't play it for more than 5 or 10 minutes
A12FZS6DJZRG1T B0076ANQQC 3 1359072000 26 i thought this would be good to entertain my kids but they really didn't get in to it. was hoping there would be more to it,
A12G01JGFOT2ID B00HRMNKWE 5 1399075200 50 I think this game is one of the best ways to give your mind a great workout. I simply love this game. It is one of the best games that I have ordered. I would recommend this one to everyone. It is so much fun. Thanks for a great game.
A12G01JGFOT2ID B00CDBLC8S 5 1400198400 37 This is a good game to play while waiting around. I would recommend this game to get. It's not hard and is fun to do. Young or old it is a great way to pass the time.
A12G01JGFOT2ID B00J3AW23G 5 1397865600 46 I wasn't sure about this game at first but I am glad that I took a chance. This game is great. It's very challenging and I'm glad I bought it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good time. Thanks for a great game.
A12G01JGFOT2ID B00I10HCV6 5 1397779200 23 This is a great game. It keeps you on your toes. I would recommend this game for everyone. It's a lot of fun.
A12G0245SPPDIB B00BYJ6BUO 1 1366761600 20 Misleading but the only thing you can see are little blips not the ful show. I was bummed about that
A12G0245SPPDIB B008Y0SERE 1 1392249600 20 Maker of the game removed it BC he sucks a big hairy flaccid one and has no appreciation for people
A12G0HXAPK1FK B00933JL0A 4 1367107200 47 Fairly easy to understand and play, and the scenarios they give add decent challenge if you want something more.  Biggest gripe would be that once you expand your town enough to the point it becomes self sustaining and the people are happy, there's nothing else to do.
A12G0HXAPK1FK B009S98W3Q 5 1367107200 36 This arcade shooter is just unbelievably fun.  The levels and modes each only take a few minutes or so, but I found myself easliy spending hours shooting away at everything.  This game is a MUST have.
A12G4B7N2OP81F B00DUGCLY4 5 1377216000 22 Fun and at times a challenge. Great to play waiting for the doctor or at the airport. Good games for kids, too.
A12G4B7N2OP81F B00HAS1AKY 4 1396396800 27 Fun game.  Some of the puzzles are a bit tricky. My kids don't get a lot of them so this is for someone a little older .
A12G4B7N2OP81F B00D5YT6IA 4 1400976000 46 This game puts a different spin on puzzle games. It's not as easy as it looks. I've had to stare at some clues for awhile before it dawned on me.  Overall, it is a fun game and, so far, challenging. My youngest really likes it, too.
A12G4B7N2OP81F B00BPC23XO 5 1385769600 23 We had fun playing this during thanksgiving break . Some were easy others had us scratching our heads.  Great for kids and adults.
A12G5H5YP8XXJK B0061RRV62 2 1381536000 26 I used to play it with my grandchildren when they were little and didn't like it then.  What made me think I would like it now
A12G5H5YP8XXJK B00CRHF748 4 1381536000 20 just got puzzle.  have done all at the 16 piece level, but having a harder time with the 25/32 pieces.
A12G5HFO74HTHF B006QCMPWM 4 1338163200 39 i  love the game but still you do not earn shells fastly without byeing them and you havr to feed other peoples fish ehen you feed others peoples fish you are wasting money you can only have 50 friends
A12G5HFO74HTHF B007SYWFRM 5 1345593600 86 I love this game this game is very interesting for kids.  you get to have your one little village  and get to name it yourself and you can change it at any time.  it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so So so so so so so nice its just so cool and awesome you get to take care of your animals. you can get to adopts and too baby's I love this game
A12G5HFO74HTHF B005UQ9FNC 5 1337644800 27 this is a great game it is easy to do a fun thing and it makes time fly. it is great for kids we all love it.
A12G5YEBGTJQPT B00IG63BVK 5 1394928000 27 I really enjoyed playing this game. Very colorful with lots of extras. There are also lots of different levels. I recommend this game for hours of fun.
A12G5YEBGTJQPT B008IJT0CE 5 1401148800 35 This app is truly wonderful. I use it every night to fall asleep to. There is a wide variety of sounds to choose from, but my favorite is the rain sounds. I highly recommended it.
A12G6PPOMKSGCW B00F0T18QQ 3 1390176000 22 Fun game although a little tougher to see the hidden objects displayed that you have to find on the bottom of page.
A12G6PPOMKSGCW B007U8JRWW 5 1340064000 22 It's like you are a voyeur to the world. You are there whenever you want to be. Lots of places to see.
A12G6PPOMKSGCW B0090JC6DQ 5 1350345600 22 Fun game very challenging works well on Samsung Galaxy Sll. Lots of fine tuning available. Every stunt is unique. Lots of fun.
A12G7F9JVQ8YCZ B00F48TFV8 5 1396051200 55 This is my first time playing a strategy game of this kind and I've fallen in love. Casual yet challenging, addicting yet easy to pick up and jump back into whenever the mood strikes. Worth the money, and you can play the tutorial before buying to see if these kinds of games are for you.
A12G7F9JVQ8YCZ B0073LHCCS 5 1387756800 23 Fun, love the variety in games- better than other brain apps and word games I've found so far. One of my favorite.Kindle downloads.
A12G8AMYVQBZV2 B008LG021M 4 1355702400 47 I would give it 5 stars.After you play for a while it starts to freeze on my kindlefire and want to force close.Its a problem that needs to be fixed.Overall its a cool game if they get the bugs out of it.Pretty good for a free app.
A12G8AMYVQBZV2 B006AZZPCM 4 1358208000 30 This is the first youtube downloader I have gotten.No problems and its easy to download videos to my kindlefire or watch videos and music.I recamend from my personal stand point.
A12G8AMYVQBZV2 B00529IOXO 1 1329609600 22 It does not show you how to add your contacts.I have spent an hour trying to figure it out.no clue.I might delete.
A12G8AMYVQBZV2 B00AIUUXHC 5 1364774400 47 Pretty good free app.Other than that its the best hungry shark of all and u keep upgrading to bigger and better sharks.But if u want to be the best , u can buy more coins from the app store.I don't recommend it for being a free app.
A12G8AMYVQBZV2 B0064XT03U 5 1329782400 51 Its well worth 99cents.It really builds up your adrenaline.I half to put it down after about 3 or 4 races at a time.I &quot;m in no hurry to win it.Lots of nice fast cars u can upgrade when u pass within third place.A definate must for all u racers out there.
A12GAQ2XGNJTK0 B008KMAJQU 4 1391299200 43 This game is really fun  but once I played it on an iphone 5 and it was so different! There were alot more weapons and u could make a buddy at rank 3. I wish u could do this on a tablet :(
A12GAQ2XGNJTK0 B00A3NQNUU 3 1388707200 28 This is the best game ever but for some reason it crashed on me! Now every time I play this game it just shows a white screen :(
A12GAZ1L4LUR7T B00FAPF5U0 4 1393718400 39 Really enjoy this game on Facebook. Glad to find this game synchronized perfectly with the Facebook version and I didn't lose any ground. The smaller screen took a few minutes to adjust to and then it was smooth sailing.
A12GAZ1L4LUR7T B00E9M3ILI 4 1390003200 31 I was warned by my daughter that this game can suck you in and it does - I lose all track of time trying to better my score - very entertaining.
A12GAZ1L4LUR7T B00FAS0MY6 4 1395100800 37 Very nice graphics. The updates tend to mess up the game for a bit. Then things smooth out. I really like the buildings and the characters. The story can run a bit slow but it is fun.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B0066W1AZK 1 1385337600 37 Good luck winning a game! Had my king, queen, three rooks,two pawns, and the game called it a draw. And their king was the last person left! Seen better chess games that don`t CHEAT. Worst chess ever.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00A4034W2 5 1401148800 28 This is my favorite game! BEST game in the world. You MUST get this game. This is a must have. Listen to me and download this game now.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00HCU7OCI 4 1395532800 49 I am very excited they finnaly put this on Kindle fire HD. I am having a awesome replay in this game. Also the game download is fast. But one problem. When i play  it sometimes freezes. But despite that, I reccomend this game to any one who likes violence.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00EHM0CVE 1 1382227200 22 TERRIBLE GAME! Bad graphics. Started over 3 times while downloading. Do  NOT get this game. Not recommended. Also for three year olds
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00ENTDDGW 5 1381968000 29 I can`t believe this game is free! The visual effects are really cool. Recommended for anyone who loves hockey. VERY short download and doesn`t take up much storage space.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00A4O6NMG 5 1383696000 43 One night I was looking for a free game that would keep me occupied for a while. I looked at this game and then tried it. It looked pretty stupid. But when I started to play, I got extremely addicted. Download this app.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00AO2P3GA 1 1402876800 31 This game like alot of other Gameloft games would NOT download properly. When it started verifying my files the download kept starting back over. Would not recommend this game to anyone.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B0067VKQLE 4 1382486400 27 This game is really cool. One of my favorite apps. Got addicted 2 years ago and I finally own it. I recommend this game for all ages.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00BUVPIRS 5 1403913600 46 This game would be great for you if you love challenges. The controls are good.The game is free roam and you can costumize your character. And its free right now. I recommend this game to anyone that likes battle and action games. Good job Crescent Moon!
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B009ZXT4BY 3 1385769600 31 This app is okay but not my favorite. I wish we had an hour to play instead of fifteen minutes. But it is still fun. If you have the full version.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00CF354UG 5 1381881600 41 You MUST get this game. Same as PS2. Finally beat the game two weeks ago.It was three years since I played. I didn't beat it the first two times I bought it. You can also change the controls to your comfort
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00DYOOGYK 2 1388361600 31 This game could be great but it was not what i expected. Clothes and guns cost WAY to much money. Gameloft could do some work on item prices within their games.
A12GBGF9ILMP2Z B00DHQHQCE 4 1383868800 23 These are the kinds of games I like. Strategy and action. The best part is that it`s free. Teaches at the right pace.
A12GG8DJVSDJG3 B00992CF6W 2 1358553600 202 This game is expensive as far as tablet games go. I would not expect a game with so little content to cost so much. I never played Minecraft before I got this app, and I was hoping it would be as fun as some of the other games I have played on the tablet. It was not even close.First of all, there is practically no point to the game. I thought that this game would be set in a vast world, but it really only takes place in a medium-sized land. Also, the monsters are easy to beat, except for the creeper. Seriously, the creeper are really annoying.I also experienced a glitch where, after a Creeper blew up my house, almost all of my world was covered in water. I have also noticed that the monsters also mostly stay in the day time. It is also worth noting that I could not get multiplayer to work. I do not know if it is just a bug in the game, or something I am doing.With all that being said, Minecraft is an alright game, just not for the price the developers want. Unless you absolutely love Minecraft, I suggest getting Block Story instead.
A12GG8DJVSDJG3 B005ZTFPFQ 4 1354665600 34 This game is exactly as it is advertised. You get one game free and pay for the rest. I love the old Atari  ames, so I bought them all. It is a great value.
A12GG8DJVSDJG3 B0077QL3OC 2 1356739200 42 This game is boring. I love Crusade of Destiny, another game by the same developers, but this is just not up to the quality of that game. I would not recommend this game to anyone, except for maybe an Elder Scrolls fan.
A12GGJSNCFOJV6 B00CKW6FVE 5 1371600000 38 its a better updated kindle fire version of the old tetris. it is a fun mind challenging game. if you like bejewled or the original tetris, then you'll like this game which is them both rolled into one.
A12GGJSNCFOJV6 B0067RQYNW 4 1358121600 37 well, it worked for a while, but then whenever I tried to open a file I needed for school it said file does not exist or cannot be opened. Which I don't understand since it worked before.
A12GGJSNCFOJV6 B0086700CM 5 1358121600 21 well great app but none of the cheats work. its too bad. But I still love the app it works great.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00FSCBNRE 5 1390262400 27 I like this slot game. It is one of the better ones that pay regularly with losing so much due to them wanting you to purchase coins.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00HKF00UI 5 1390608000 26 This slot has big wins and often. At least it has for me. You can always try it with nothing to lose since it is free.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00DX65ORM 4 1390262400 32 SOME OF THE SLOTS I PLAY GOES THRU A LOT OF COINS BEFORE IT PAYS OFF AND THEN OLY IN SMALL AMOUNTS BUT THIS ONE IS PRETTY REALISTIC IN HOW IT PAYS.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00G5LQ5MU 5 1387411200 25 This game is very hard. If you like difficult games you will like this, maybe. It's definitely not for my little grandson who is 6
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00HHBXYGM 5 1398729600 22 Not sure just what the purpose Will be to this game since I just started but so far I really like it
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00975HIYU 4 1381622400 27 For a beginning slot for me, it's okay but a bit birding. So far not many wins as I'm used to. Oh well, can't win an all
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00992CF6W 4 1396137600 42 Great game ihate all the other knock offs except block heads that's good I love this game I have it for pc and laptop and xbox thisbis pretty much the best game evar but on my tablet I can't delete my place
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00H343YNQ 4 1390694400 33 This is a very fun game and has several ways to get free coins. They it, it is free. Only thing is I cannot sign into Facebook thru it to play with friends
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00CXBSYVG 4 1391644800 28 This is an okay bingo app. I have played better ones. But if you are a bing nut then you will add this one to your app library
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00BNJGZBK 4 1374192000 25 I don't really like these find the missing pieces games but it's not bad. Not sure I'll buy the whole game though. We will see.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B007SYWFRM 5 1390867200 291 I give this game five stars because I love it and there are similar ones out there but all fall lacking compared to this one. I do have some major grips. 1. When there are special collections offered, it will n not let me acquire them. They are not in my store any where. Is this due to the fact that I play it on my tablet vs. my phone????? I do not know. 2. It is claimed that the Scrat game is random. If this is so then why do I get $58,000 etc. Over and over and over? I wish winning more acorns are possible since that is mostly what u need to purchase your dino' s in the under world so a person can only go so far by strategy then it's apparent that you will need to purchase acorns to continue at any pace. I believe that the creators under estimate most people. I love having control on the strategy and earning my items vs. Using actual money to progress. What has changed is that I used to be slightly obsessed with constantly having to check my village to collect so I could build it up. Now that I mostly need acorns to progress I am lucky if I remember to check it once daily. This is sad. If the odds of winning acorns was better, I know I would be on there several times a day. I also wish they would make another along the same lines. Land Before Time????'?? I have tried many other that are similar in natural but still there's is something they do not have that this one does so I am not gripped into them as I was with this one.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00F9ZO3Z4 5 1383868800 30 I play most of the slot games and this one is up there for graphics, they are some of the best. Pay offs are good enough it keeps my interest
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00BMR4RIG 5 1393286400 58 I have tried a lot of different weather apps and this has been the most accurate out of them all. It's simple to use and has nice graphics with out all the extra yuk. If you want to know your temperature, the days forecast or the coming weeks, this one is for you. Also the cost is minimal.
A12GID1HOOBX8L B00FEMJF6O 4 1387324800 153 This is a sweet little game. See 's to go very slow getting build up though which is as it is with these types of games. I play and love Ice Age Village but am at a wall at the moment due to my creed that I work for what I get and will not purchase using money, anything I need. I realize that is why these games are free n it's a wise way to make money on a game that it takes talent and lots of time n money to create but with our country the messed up way that it is in areas now, I have others things needed just to survive to spend my money on. So it takes slot more time to build up the game as intended. But we have to admit, these types of games take patience n that is something we all need to hone.
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00BHHIWQO 4 1364256000 37 I like this game...it's fun, challenging, and fast paced. Only problem is that I don't feel like I'm accomplishing or working towards anything. I also tried to login to Facebook and it wouldn't let me! Please fix!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00ATDOVNK 5 1364947200 52 Great graphics, fast-paced and action packed! Sometimes these games are hit or miss but this one is far from cheesy. Great story line and for the money, you get at least 2-3 consecutive hours of heart-pounding fun! A little pricier than I would have liked, but all in all worth every penny.
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B007ZD17XO 5 1362096000 32 If you like jewel games then you will love this! Loads of levels, beautiful graphics, awesome sounds, and hours of jewel blasting fun. If you don't buy this app you are crazy!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00AQF8CJ0 5 1358726400 20 Fun game for all! My daughter is 5 &amp; I am 33. We both love playing this together. Great app!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00GK5Z7LQ 5 1403827200 21 This was a fun and somewhat challenging game. It took me the day to finish it, but I loved every minute!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00DWJBOI8 5 1377648000 32 Super fun game, interesting plot. Challenging, which is great because most games like this tend to be too easy. If you like these kinds of games, you will definitely love this one.
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00D2XD5JU 3 1401062400 42 It's fun but it's just like a cheap looking version of all the other games just like it. Some of the levels are ridiculous and your life supply is super weak. Don't bother unless you are really into these kinds of games.
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00CWG9EUM 5 1377129600 42 I wish this game was longer, but I loved playing every second of it! I cannot wait until part 2 comes out. Great mini games, great strategy, very intelligent. If you like these types of games, don't be apprehensive, get it now!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00HFTHXMC 5 1395273600 29 The graphics are great and its a fun and classic bubble shooter game. Love it! If you like these types of games, then you should download this one now!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B00FX6ZBXC 5 1400112000 46 So much fun! Anyone who likes to play Scrabble will really like this game! If you are unsure about a word, it turns green if what you play is an actual word. You get loads of free coins and you can play with your FB friends!
A12GIOHHJYSKN8 B0097GVJWQ 5 1360627200 25 Wish it went on a little longer but it was action packed, challenging, and loads of fun. I cab hardly wait for the next one!!!!
A12GIQE383XV4A B009KEN87O 5 1364515200 38 This game hits the bulls-eye on retro. I got this game for free and even though it was free, it would be worth the (weird) price of $2.56.I also made this because I will be the 600th reviewer!
A12GIQE383XV4A B00CSR2J9I 5 1369180800 64 This game is really fun because it gives you the freedom to try out different things on different tracks, and you get to experiment with which kinds of cars you want to use. Although a million coins seems like a lot to pay for a snowmobile in the game, you can earn the coins really quickly and the purchase is very much worth it.
A12GIQE383XV4A B00A3NQNUU 4 1363132800 144 I absolutely love this game. It has good graphics, great gameplay and it never ends! The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the accounts. I personally don't have a Facebook so I couldn't sign in. You might think, Okay, so what? Well, as you might know there is no other way to sign in. So I was level 23, had 4 or 5 epics and had spent about $15 on gems, and one day I was forced to reset my kindle to factory defaults and my park was gone. If I could have signed in with my e-mail I could have saved it and not wasted all that money. So if I could say one thing to the developers, it would be, &quot;Make a way to create an account with e-mail. Other than that this is my absolute favorite game!
A12GIQE383XV4A B007A6K2GY 3 1381449600 74 It's a decent game, but definitely not one I will be playing for hours on end. Just glad I didn't pay the $5. I think they should make this $1.99. If you are considering buying the rest, I would recommend waiting for a year or so, because by then most of them will have been FAOTDs. Probably so considering that they've have two of them as FAOTDs over the past 3 months I believe.
A12GIQE383XV4A B00AZZGOWI 5 1362787200 27 This game ROCKS! I want to thank the developers because when I bought 1$ worth of coins, I got an achievement that gave me 200 extra! Awesome.
A12GIQE383XV4A B00992CF6W 5 1365638400 183 I realize that some of you are complaining about the lack of water and spawning stuff, if you want that stuff, get Pocketinveditor ProPocketInvEditor Pro. It is super cool. Anyway, this game is super fun. I don't play it on pc, too many annoying people, but this version is awesome!UPDATE: 6/18/13Also, for those people freaking out about the update, it came out, no need to blow your top. I saw a couple reviews that said that they couldn't log in to the realms thing. You have to use a Mojang account, not a Minecraft account. And I agree, I thought that there was no way to play local multiplayer, and this is completely Mojangs fault, but I just went on YouTube and looked up how to and if somebody else started the world, you click play and scroll all the way to the bottom and you will see, "world on WiFi" or something like that. If you don't see it, make sure you have local server multiplayer turned on, by the way that setting is located in the settings, on the first page.
A12GIQE383XV4A B009WYCDZU 5 1364256000 185 Okay, first I am going to start off by saying that this game is amazing. It is super awesome because if you have Orgin on Most Wanted 2 for the XBOX 360 you can sign in and have all of your SP which is cool. The graphics are great, the gameplay is really fun. I don't understand what some people are complaining about, the races aren't that hard until the Most Wanted, which I am at, and the cops are fun to battle with and some parts they ruin your race but I don't understand what they are complaining about, the whole point of Most Wanted is the cops. I have played the first Most Wanted from 2005, the game would be just about nothing without cops. The new game from 2012, which I also have centers around cops. So if you people complaining about the police being annoying, you obviously either have not played the first two games or see no fun in getting in virtual trouble and wrecking police without actually wrecking cops. Thanks for your time and for reading this rambling review.
A12GIQE383XV4A B00B2V66VS 5 1386374400 22 This game is so very much fun because it is very fun  and I enjoy playing it and my high score 12000000
A12GIQE383XV4A B00AB7HESI 5 1365897600 124 This game is totally awesome. I think that you people who can't download this game onto your kindle fire have an older, first generation Kindle Fire. That's the problem, all the new games are optimized for the Kindle Fires that were released on September 14, 2012. Also, I have a fire HD and it didn't take that long to download. Of course it's going to take a while because it's 180 megabytes, but not  10 hours. It took maybe 10 minutes at most for me. Also, the first gen Fire might need to be updated to a higher version so you can play the newer games. And for the person that got stuck at 91%, You might not have any space left.Hope this helped.
A12GIQE383XV4A B008B0S0XK 5 1364169600 42 This game is super awesome! Get it while it's ninety nine cents! It is totally worth it! It's even worth the full price but it is a steal for $0.99! Everyone who is looking for a good basketball game, get this TODAY!
A12GLZKARMCBP7 B00AK0X5VQ 4 1364169600 33 Relaxed game, interesting concept, I enjoy it and spent a good time playing it.  Still pick it up every once in a while, but it didn't become a go to game for me.
A12GLZKARMCBP7 B00846WWVM 4 1364169600 20 It is a fun little game, gets challenging pretty quickly, worth playing but it is not really addictive for me.
A12GOURCX6WCIE B00AIUUXHC 4 1393632000 53 my little one sees my play this on my ipod and she wanted it so bad i got it on my kindle so she could play it. she loves it, it is so funny when she plays and she trys to talk to the sharks its a very nice game like it alot.
A12GOURCX6WCIE B00B2V66VS 4 1364860800 24 Its a nice game. I try to play it but i was never any good with part one ether but its fun to try.
A12GOURCX6WCIE B0099S2HAK 4 1364860800 49 Its good. Very challenging the longer you play the harder it gets. There is just some puzzles on here you don't think your ever going to solve. But when you finely find the answer it makes you want to kick yourself because it was so obveuse to you afterward.
A12GPX1QSR8P0T B006HUWEHY 5 1362700800 25 I love this app .......this app is so much fun get  it .You will love this  i love this I love this I love this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A12GPX1QSR8P0T B00DJFIMW6 5 1375142400 46 Definitely get this game it is better than any other game you can get on your device that's free or not so click the download button and as soon as you play it you will love it and want to rate it :):):):) I &lt;3 it
A12GPX1QSR8P0T B00A4O6NMG 1 1359158400 37 I wish I could play this game but I cant I dont have a facebook acont I donloded this game because I thought it was going to be a fun game but now its just a mystery.
A12GPX1QSR8P0T B00AKFBURC 4 1364601600 38 I like this app but it is not better than  super penguins .......super penguins is so much fun  I mean this app is fun to but between super penguins and angry gran run I would choose super penguins!!!!!!!!!
A12GPX1QSR8P0T B0097C8XL0 5 1361059200 34 This app is so much fun but better than temple run not temple run two but just temple run OMG love it ........like amazing...............GET THIS APP!!!!!!! Get this app.....this app is so much fun!!!!!
A12GPX1QSR8P0T B0074W01II 4 1359158400 20 this game is really fun but if you play it for a really long time it starts to get boring.
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B005HSL626 5 1339718400 29 I said always because I okay it in my computer n ipad. it's fun. especially with the achievement, u will play it over n over to get them all.
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B00DJFIMW6 3 1375660800 22 it's a nice game, but it's too expensive to buy the characters and stuff. I like other game similar to this better!!!
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B008FETAQS 1 1345939200 22 it's difficult, the enemy is just too strong...u can't use ur item anytime u want in battle, it cud b more fun...
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B00CRLSN4U 2 1372550400 38 and once you stuck you can't continue. the problem is the hint is too expensive, and it's too hard to get the coin, unless you buy with a real money. AND I DON'T WANT TO DO IT!!! LOL
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B0087TUZII 1 1342224000 64 it take hours or even days to complete a quest, because it's expensive, n when u level up, your Stat wont b, the thing is the enemy also level up, so it's even harder to finish an area, n it's s**k!!! n to make u stronger u need better gears which r REALLY EXPENSIVE. this cud b more fun if it's not too expensive.
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B008B84O6Y 1 1339804800 39 yes, it's indeed a very good game, fun. but I have a problem with all kiwi games which I played, they cut me off from the server. so it's annoying, and mane this game not fun to b played.
A12GQVS6FYXJIH B007PT3QOQ 1 1342224000 33 I like this game, n still play it, but my tree wont grow, I will wait till I run out of tree, n if my tree still not growing, I will uninstall it!!!
A12GVL7KFPOZCV B008N8IV2U 3 1346889600 20 the game is a lot of fun until you reach the unbeatable level worth the blue and red sound buttons.
A12GVL7KFPOZCV B00A8ECU24 5 1386806400 20 Me and my siblings love the show and we love this game it is good for all Bronys and Pegasisters
A12GVL7KFPOZCV B00FAPF5U0 4 1388102400 53 The game is great and responds well on the kindle.  Unfortunately it does not sync well with facebook or other devices.  I have lives that show up here that do not show up on my galaxy and vice versa.  Also the reward wheel feature from the android market version would be much appreciated.
A12GVL7KFPOZCV B00AOA9BL0 5 1401926400 43 I've been using this app and a micro hd to hdmi cable to play shows on my t.v. and it works great!  Awesome to watch in bed rather than only where my cable box is.  And it's a great mix of available shows.
A12GWGMGSW26VQ B00CB8JY9M 4 1367193600 21 Its okay and I enjoy playing it with my grandchildren and it keeps me occupied when I have timr to kill
A12GWGMGSW26VQ B009G9KFQ0 4 1367193600 21 I like having it because I always check the weather and it seems to beableto change whenever the weather is changing
A12GWGMGSW26VQ B00BHHIWQO 4 1364515200 21 fun, enjoyable to play, wish you wouldn't have to wait so long to get more hearts to enable you play longer
A12GX216LFBI8T B0089BPEZS 5 1375228800 29 This is a great app for a 2 year old to watch their favorite movies on when in a restuarant waiting for the food to get to the table.
A12GX216LFBI8T B00BFX2DI8 2 1375228800 31 Thought this would be great for my 2year old grandson, but all the stuff on it is way over his head.  What ever happened to the Disney we new as kids????
A12GX216LFBI8T B007IIZVLA 1 1375228800 21 just didn't like how this one worked.  found kidCare and like it a lot better. don't have anything else to say!
A12GYWZLJR6943 B00A3WTXQ2 5 1355616000 22 its so cute and difficult and ppl should really get this app its like the best little app;) Have a Merry Christmas!!!:)
A12GYWZLJR6943 B00AEWUQG2 3 1356048000 24 it gets annoying because you lose all your stars ad i do not want to pay just to play that game.but everything is a-ok!:)
A12GZGV0X3ROMR B007XKEY6Q 3 1357689600 35 This game is fun to play and what makes it even better, is that you can play at your own pace without automatically resigning. Let's you go at your on pace when you need to!
A12GZGV0X3ROMR B009KS4XRO 5 1355097600 29 I just couldn't wait until this app came to Kindle Fire. This is my FAVORITE game in FaceBook and now I can take it with me wherever I go!!
A12GZGV0X3ROMR B00CLVQ8GG 4 1370822400 34 I have been able to get more bingos with this game than any other so far. If you play it everyday, and play it smart, you won't have to buy any credits to play!
A12GZV73J3U73L B00CWG9EUM 4 1382832000 22 I really enjoyed the game. It was challenging and interesting. I really like the Big Fish Games. Keep up the good work.
A12GZV73J3U73L B00E0NWJVG 4 1379462400 23 I like the game, to but there should be more hidden objects in the game. Other than that it is a pleasing game.
A12H5877VJVX8E B00BMAHA9Q 1 1384300800 56 This app constantly forces closed.  Everytime you try to go to the level it gets about 85% loaded and then closes.  I have not been ableto play this at all.  I am using s Samsung galaxy S4  with 4.3 so hardware shouldn't be the issue.  Until they fix the issues it is a waste of money.
A12H68NUU2TB8I B006D1ONE4 5 1329782400 21 This game has the perfect mix of challenge and the introduction of new elements. Recommended to anyone that likes puzzle games
A12H68NUU2TB8I B004WPKENW 1 1316217600 37 this game is a blatant ripoff of of a free flash game. the art has been changed, but the creator of this app is soulless for charging for a game that someone far more creative already made.
A12H68NUU2TB8I B0051UP5NQ 3 1349222400 78 Great Office product. The UI is pretty good, nice features, but skimping on spell check to sell dictionaries is shameful. Having to shell out more money to buy a dictionary for spell check, while not integrating free dictionaries (like ColorDict) is a cheap cash grab, and the inconvenience of needing to use other office services to spell check (quick office includes it, but the UI isn't as good) is a burden. 3 stars for an otherwise stellar app
A12H68NUU2TB8I B005DSLRDS 4 1320537600 25 In addition to making an easy way to place instant access sound widgets, all sounds can be exported and used for messages, alerts or ringtones
A12H6LZYN1I2L3 B005F9Z2G8 1 1312934400 73 Ads on every page. If I want ads, I&apos;ll go to the website, I certainly won&apos;t pay to see them. It&apos;s ugly. The way they have the text laid out is hard to read. Every time you return to the article list from an article it resets to the top of the page, losing your place. There are so many better ways to get news, this is the last thing I&apos;d use. Uninstalled.
A12H6LZYN1I2L3 B004YEJGEO 3 1312675200 99 The game play is awesome!  That said, prisms are buggy, I often find that I have to delete them, or block lasers just to get them to work right. I sometimes end up with 1 laser in with no output, which should not be possible. The game also force closes, a sure sign of buggy code. Another minor gripe, there&apos;s no putting in a user name, so I can&apos;t let my kids play through the levels on their own progression. And, it needs a better tutorial, because switching the direction of the 2nd prism output is far from intuitive.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00C7TAF3Y 4 1383177600 73 The graphics are great. It ran smoothly on my KFHD. The puzzles were the perfect difficulty level for me - made me think but weren't so hard I felt like an idiot, or so easy that I got bored. I would have given it 5 stars, but I got The Room as a FAotD, if I'd paid for it I would feel it was way too short. It's only got like six puzzles.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00H59CTW6 4 1405728000 13 Good game, though prices are a little high. But I really like it.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B0094FYBB6 4 1367193600 48 I enjoy this app.  Also most of the people playing random opponent games are reasonably smart, which is a nice change. Between games it shows ads, which I'm fine with, but being forced to sit through the same 30 second commercial over and over gets old pretty quick.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00IIY2DP0 4 1393804800 58 The chapters are short, yes. There is a 4 hour wait between finishing one and starting the next, so no, this isn't a game you'll be playing for hours on end. But if your life revolves around, well, REAL LIFE, 4 hours isn't that long and you probably won't notice it. I think it is a fun distraction.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B0097EWK3A 5 1376092800 24 Because you will want to buy the full game.  Another excellent HO offering from Big Fish, and pretty creepy.  Worked well on my KFHD
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00FGFVMGA 4 1385683200 38 This is a fun point and click adventure type game. No hidden object puzzles and nice artwork. However I finished it under two hours, which is Ok  for a FAOTD but I'd prefer more from a paid app.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00C0RE13I 2 1373155200 95 The game itself is cute but the ads that pop up randomly put me off. I'm not against adds; I understand this is a free game and the money has to come from somewhere. However the ads in this game pop up randomly you're playing and sometimes (often, actually) get clicked by accident, which closes CC and takes you to the app store. Twice now my game has locked up from inadvertantly clicking an ad and has to be removed and started completely. I won't be starting a third time ; it's not that fun.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00AOX5Z4E 5 1374364800 86 I'm not generally a room escape genre kind of girl, but when this was FAotD I figured what the heck, reviews are good and free is free. I was pleasantly surprised!  Between figuring out how to make the objects you've collected work in various tasks and some tongue in cheek humor from the devs, there is plenty to keep the brain entertained for a bit. Also the hint system is excellent, offering as much or as little guidance as you need. This app is a win.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B005YH5R7A 5 1380067200 50 I have found this to be a very handy app with a whole lot of content for free. I especially favor the &quot;reflections&quot; in daily readings, to explain and explore the gospel. I am currently in RCIA and beside reading the readings every day I also use it in class.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B005ZXWMUS 5 1375142400 42 This is probably my favorite app, it is definately the one I use most often. Works great on a KFHD but it does use a lot of juice so have a charge cord handy if you plan on watching a marathon :)
A12H919SL5U2N1 B0097GVJWQ 5 1376092800 26 Excellent game.  Worked well on my KFHD 7&#34;.  Beautiful creepy graphics and well thought out story.  I finished it in about 4 1/2 hrs of gameplay.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B008JJM88Q 5 1376092800 45 You know those times when your friends are draped over your furniture and you're all pretty much too high to think up conversation?  Never suffer through that again with the help of Akinator!  Your friends will be giggling in no time, and chicks dig funny.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00B63HT8Q 5 1401235200 56 I have had other weather apps, but they got to the point of ridiculous with the extra junk. I don't want to collect points, all I really want is a working radar. This radar works fine on my Kindle Fire, and doesn't show me a bunch of crap videos and points earned and whatever. Love it.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00FEMJF6O 5 1384473600 22 Very addicting. So far none of Zynga's oopses so common on Facebook. And it is pretty. The music is not too annoying.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B004GWRMWC 5 1376092800 50 I wish Amazon had more real estate apps in their market, because Zillow shows more for-sale-by-owner and a few bank-owneds rather than the MLS, but it's a good app, the map works well, and I use it often.  Much more convenient than using Zillow.com on the browser on my KFHD.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B008FC5APU 1 1375920000 44 I don't know what game we played as kids and called Gin, but it wasn't this, so first off it wasn't what I expected. The &quot;how to play&quot; didn't explain...well it didn't explain much and after 2 rounds I deleted it. Did not enjoy.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B0059WTMLW 5 1376092800 20 I love the layout of this game and how it highlights the numbers already placed for you.  Well done. .
A12H919SL5U2N1 B0087HEQ6M 1 1374451200 33 I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire HD but it would not get past the initial loading screen and kept telling me it needed internet access though my internet is working fine. Lame.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1373846400 177 I am enjoying this app. Works well and so far moving right along without "having" to spend actual money, though of course that is an option. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is, once you have collected rent and sent the citizens off on their missions, there's nothing else to do, so it isn't one that you can kill an hour with. But I still like it.*Edit* I have been playing this now about 5 months, and I have to say, I like it way more now than I did when I wrote the original review.  I even gave it a 5th star.  It is absolutely addicting.  Things seem to cost a lot, or it takes a long time to collect enough in game cash to buy a new building, but even that hasn't hampered my enjoyment as I thought it might, and I now play more than ever.  The Halloween update is AWESOME.  The things the characters say are HILARIOUS.  Download this app, tons and tons of playing time for free.
A12H919SL5U2N1 B00CW6DAKC 5 1373068800 41 If you thought the biggest thing wrong with Farmville was Zynga, this is the game for you. Cute graphics, works just like it's meant to. I  am enjoying it and if you like these kinds of games, you will as well.
A12HAUH8D3QXQG B00CHNKJFO 4 1370563200 37 I have to say this is a fantastic pinball game in the FX series. I have played better pinball games but for a fan of both Star Wars and pinball then you can't miss with this game.
A12HAUH8D3QXQG B0094BB4TW 3 1385424000 20 The Kindle version doesn't update to the most recent version but it works for the basic FB use just fine.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B00CBUGMZY 5 1374451200 22 I think it's fun but would like to be able to get more outfits quicker. but it is still a fun game
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B00ASSF19Y 5 1358035200 28 I love this game a lot and play it on my aunts kindle.I love dress games and this is a good one.everyone of the dolls is very pretty.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B00ANH526W 5 1358899200 56 this is a great fun game that keeps you interested and entertained.the only down fall is you need to purchase diamonds with real money which is far too expencive.all the good stuff requires diamonds and it teaches kids they can not obtain nice things without riches...not a good thingto teach kids in this time.otherwise very entertaining.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B008NCUFYS 5 1354924800 40 I love this game and it is fun when needing to pass the time when your bored.it would be more fun if we were able to earn more gold to buy stuff and more opportunity to win prizes more often.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B006MLHVLM 5 1355011200 30 this is a lot of fun but it should give more choices of ornaments and trees to make it more fun. its free so it is worth it and fun.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B00HDRTGDK 1 1391299200 71 this requires real money for hints. you only earn one coin for each right answer and each hint (which is only one letter) is 15 coins each. the questions are not trivia but pictures of eithervery well known things or extremely obscure things that no one has even heard of. if they get you to purchase even a few coins they make money for something that is not worth hour money.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B00AP9U8SA 5 1358035200 24 my neice spends hours playing these games.you rate it and receive the whole game for free which is a bonus. it is very worthwile.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B0087SGWI6 5 1362268800 28 it is fun and I was surprised at all the game options.it's free and well worth getting.it does what it say's it will do by improving your memory.
A12HBBV9HKSJLI B00BWBHIUG 5 1367193600 30 this game is fun and easy to play.it is very beautiful, but the only downside is you have yo spend real money for pearls and the time to grow everything
A12HBTWB7XPYO4 B008DGDK64 5 1354665600 20 ALL YOU HAVE to do if you notice it isn't working is delete the app and reload the app again=)
A12HBTWB7XPYO4 B00992CF6W 5 1356393600 24 Awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome game!!!!!!!!! Who hoooo! Who hoo! yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay yay!
A12HBTWB7XPYO4 B00594XOZU 5 1366848000 45 My best freind Tyler told me about this and now ive kept it for a year and it hasnt had A SINGLE problem at ALL. Now all my freinds and a couple different people are on there as well&hellip; My username for kik is: TechnicalTails
A12HCPXHTX8QJ0 B0055ILRN6 5 1364860800 97 I got this app because we were afraid of how much wifi I was using on my Kindle Fire HD. It is very easy to use and shows you the data in many ways. Graphs, Charts and breakdown of which programs suck the most wifi help me to decide if a program is worth it.I am a member of Audible and I find that my audible books being downloaded are the most usage for me. I don't stream movies or video so I don't know what that would do.I love this app and use it every day.
A12HCPXHTX8QJ0 B00AQ398AY 5 1357948800 105 I am prejudiced towards this company, because my son works there. I don't have a cell phone that can use Lookout, so this is the first time I have been able to use this program.I am delighted with the way it looks and how it does it's job.I love knowing it is backing up my Fire HD and is checking on what I download.I am no techie, so I find Lookout very easy to use and very concise on showing you what it has done and it's continual monitoring.This is a wonderful program and I am pleased my son works for such a wonderful company!
A12HCPXHTX8QJ0 B004XQYBA2 5 1365120000 90 I am lousy at numbers but love puzzles. This game has so many options that anyone can enjoy the gametime. I am still on the very easy puzzles but my time is improving. I like the options menu that gives you choices on knowing if you made a mistake or if there are conflicts on your puzzle. I play the game to pass the time so I am not into strict rule playing. This means you can play it easy or rough. Right now I like it easy.Fun, fun, fun!
A12HCVHKKUBE2E B00AECGQF2 5 1378252800 22 It is the best salon app ever! I mean really I can't stop playing my friends on mmorpg project miss me! LOL
A12HCVHKKUBE2E B004SOR4H6 3 1366156800 32 Works ok but oddly whenever I download this app to my kindle all my favorites disappear. Then when it's uninstalled the favorites come back. Also it's impossible to deactivate accounts incredibly frustrating.
A12HCVHKKUBE2E B00D3MWW44 5 1376697600 18 I love so awsome it is not so girlie thats y i like!It is the funest gameSO GET
A12HED9SBIGZMD B004SJ3BCI 3 1357171200 39 not an angry birds fan. I tried this app & found out how simple and mindless angry birds is. I prefer brain teaser games or mindful apps. If you like angry birds, then you'll like this app just fine.
A12HED9SBIGZMD B0064X7FVE 5 1378684800 40 Every morning I check my Weather Channel app on Kindle Fire HD to know what length of clothes to wear that day. Wisconsin weather is quite unpredictable &amp; the Weather Channel helps me be predictably comfortable every day, all day:)
A12HED9SBIGZMD B004U75OYG 5 1357171200 35 I really enjoy this game. It's a great brain teaser and is easy to navigate this app. I recommend this over angry birds, fruit ninja, or any of the many other mindless games out there.
A12HED9SBIGZMD B006PK2TEE 5 1353715200 21 simple and fun. lots of categories to choose from. passes time quickly and easily. works very well on kindle fire hd.
A12HED9SBIGZMD B004S2W37O 5 1358208000 47 This app is positively fantastic for keeping track of who's doing what where when, grocery list/shopping list/to do list, addresses/phone numbers/email, journal entries/reminder notes, etc. Pretty much anything & everything you need to keep or get yourself & your family organized...this is the only app you need&lt;3
A12HED9SBIGZMD B0094BB4TW 5 1357171200 21 I rarely use my laptop for facebook anymore. This app is so similar to normal laptop view and far more convenient.
A12HED9SBIGZMD B004SOR4H6 4 1357171200 20 this is a really good app & it could get 5 stars. I just don't go on twitter very often.
A12HHM3OU8TM6O B004SRNH10 1 1386633600 38 I cannot use this on my kindle fire.  I purchased the New York times Crossword Puzzle and I can't use it as it requires adobe air and it won't work with my kindle fire.  I am very disappointed.
A12HKGC0AJO7N5 B004O3YGMC 5 1333584000 35 I got this when it was free and just now had the time to set it up... not perfectly optimized for the Fire but being able to run iTunes and use Chrome is pretty cool.
A12HKGC0AJO7N5 B005ZXWMUS 2 1335225600 48 this would be an ok app if they would keep it up to date. the aneroid market now has a version 2 issues fresher that takes care of all the glitchiness mentioned in other reviews. the only negative to owning a Fire... update your apps for goodness sake.
A12HKGC0AJO7N5 B007Q3GY1S 5 1336176000 32 I never got to have one of my own but always played my friends when he would let me... now I have my own and it is better than the original :)
A12HKGC0AJO7N5 B0066TUXU6 5 1334534400 260 I see bad ratings for this app and it is always because they are trying to use on unsupported device or they didn't know what hulu + is. hulu + is a service that provides tons of full episodes and movies to your account. you can then access that content from any device. yes some shows are restricted to web access only but those are clearly marked. I was able to get rid of cable because all my comedy central shows are available next day. abc, nbc, pbs, and tons of other channels are available and streanm in HD to you Fire beautifully. someone suggested you could come out ahead by just purchasing from amazon... that is ridiculous. one show has an avg of 23 episodes a year and amazon charges 2.99 for hd television episodes, totalling 68.77 per year... and that is just one show. the hulu + subscription is 95.88 per year and you get access to thousands of shows and many more movies. if you plan on watching more than one show you come out way ahead financially. plus you have to account for cloud storage fees if you are going to be buying 23+ Tv episodes every year because you will be way over your Fire's storage. streaming is flawless with a connection of 12 mbps or faster, and did I mention the picture is amazing. read the app description, understand the service, and don't rate an awesome app based on emotion if you choose to purchase the app without a hulu+ account or a Fire.
A12HKGC0AJO7N5 B0063M86B4 5 1323302400 42 With full screen utilization and tons of interactive content this app brings Wired to life. Just finding all the little bonuses like audio and video files, or touch here for more details functions makes this reading experience one of the best ever!!
A12HKY837WS9SE B004SZHD3K 5 1326672000 27 This is a great app for slot machine lovers who just can't make it to Vegas right now. It's fun to play, with realistic sounds and graphics.
A12HKY837WS9SE B005ZXWMUS 5 1326672000 33 I have this app on the iPad2 and also watch Netflix on two different PC laptops and a desktop. The kindle fire app works just as good, and the quality is great too.
A12HKY837WS9SE B0063IH60K 5 1324080000 21 Great app, no problems, fun to play, good choices of colors, backgrounds, style of play, etc.  Graphics are good as well!
A12HKY837WS9SE B0064T6LV8 5 1326672000 62 If you grew up in the 80's (like me) hanging out in arcades playing real pinball machines and other classics, you'll love this. Most other pinball apps I've found are in 3D with graphics that tilt in a kind of virtual reality way that I dislike (gives me a headache!), but this does not. So fun to play; I really love it!
A12HRUFKNPHPBY B007XKEY6Q 5 1388880000 47 Ok so I'm a game reviewer and so far I have played games and reviewed them and they were bad games I hated them but this one just blows me away it's amazing graphics are great thanks for making this game it's awesome.  #Kianna brown game reviewer
A12HRUFKNPHPBY B009HKL4B8 1 1390176000 46 I got this app and I wanted to play it soooo bad and I got on it and an error message popped up saying something went wrong and to redownload it so I did and the same thing happened this app is a waste of time
A12HRUFKNPHPBY B00GNIJAEA 4 1390176000 25 Well I love it but I'm a kid and you HAVE to have a Facebook account do it's a real bummer I can't play it:(
A12HRUFKNPHPBY B00992CF6W 5 1395014400 45 This is the best game in the world apparently because my daughter won't stop playing it she talks about something called mobs she tells me stuff about and I just nod along like I know what she is talking about but I don't it's great!
A12HRUFKNPHPBY B00DJYC55C 5 1395446400 46 Ok I downloaded this game and it is perfectly fine! It doesn't say inappropriate things and I played it. And it's fine and there is no man in the eyes it is a reflection of Paris to make it look more realistic OK READ THIS REVIEW
A12HZJZGW75EME B009S98W3Q 5 1352160000 21 excellent graphics.  fun fun fun!  I never get bored of playing. I like the option to replay levels with different weapons.
A12HZJZGW75EME B0085P2Z6E 5 1355443200 21 good story line. its got hidden object and other puzzles along with it. keeps you busy for hours. I enjoy it.
A12HZJZGW75EME B007P6T52G 5 1338422400 26 I love this game!!! it takes awhile to get the items you need but totally worth it. I highly recommend this game to everyone.  five stars!!!!!!!
A12HZJZGW75EME B00A77II0U 5 1354752000 25 excellent game. definitely work paying for. hidden object plus makes you think of how to use objects to get you through the game. highly recommended!
A12I72G6QE3WT6 B00846GKTW 5 1351123200 30 THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN FOR PEOPLE WHO WANNA BE A PHOTOGRAPHER OR A MODEL IT HAS REALLY GIOD DETAILS AND IT IS A TRU FASHION SENSATION!!~Mariah A.K.A. MB Ghurl
A12I72G6QE3WT6 B008JGSM6G 5 1350691200 32 This Game Is Really Addictive, When I First Got This Game I Thought It Was Sack But Then When The Challenge Started Rolling In I Saw That It Was Actually Really Fun...~Mariah
A12I72G6QE3WT6 B004WKWU5M 3 1350777600 46 This Eye Flooring App Is OK For Some Of My Pictures In The Photos When You View The App The Eye Colorado Looks Real But Then When You Actually Do It With Your Pictures Its Fake....But The Thing Is when You Upload It It Looks Real!!
A12I72G6QE3WT6 B006KX3GXO 5 1350691200 43 Makes Photo Editing Way Easier And Fun I First Realized I Needed Something Like PicsArt When My Photos Started Looking Dull... I Really Suggest This To Anyone Who Wants Words Or Decorations On Their Picture IAm Like Obsessed With PicsArt Photo Studio!!! &lt;3
A12I73B1D67Q0K B00ELOOYZI 5 1385424000 38 I've been a fan of this dev's physics game for a while. Very well designed and not too technical to learn. Even my 7 year old is a fan now...Simple Rockets is on all of our mobile devices.
A12I98DMRXV7L4 B00GP0G0IK 5 1385769600 83 This game is addictive...couldn't wait to get back to it after HAVING to put it down.I enjoyed the story line, graphics very good, finding the many needed objects and having to go back added to the adventure of the game. Not making it to easy is good. Having the ( hint and map) options is a good choice to include. I played the easy option and enjoyed it...Will probably play a more difficult one in a few days.Thanks for a great mystery-adventure-fantasy game.
A12I98DMRXV7L4 B007VT07QU 5 1390435200 24 I really enjoy the adventure part and interaction. It is a simple task/adventure game. I give it a 5 star so far...keeping my attention.
A12I98DMRXV7L4 B00ATPVA78 5 1385856000 22 Thoroughly enjoyed the mysterious aura of this game. Loved the characters...Good art, good story line, and interesting mystical fantasy game.Loved the game.
A12I98DMRXV7L4 B00ATDOVNK 5 1391040000 74 This game is like reading an adventure novel and literally being one of the characters. Including a video storyline through out has a great affect on increasing the adventures real-ness to the player. I enjoyed the puzzles, the memory games included were great. Another great G5 game.If l could offer a suggestion...a game with multiple endings, depending on the players choices would be a great option...though much programing needed.Thanks again for a great game.
A12I9A785A584L B00BLS2U6M 4 1387411200 55 So I got this game a month ago and it was great until I had to name myself. I put the name, &quot;Hannah &quot; in exept it erased my name so my name was.....Yeah. I couldnt change it. Im trying again but it might not work. I guess we will see. Maby it will work!
A12I9A785A584L B00CZDSK7K 4 1403395200 64 I love this game! I do have a couple suggestions though.-Boyfriend/Girlfriends. I think it would be cool if when the kids are 13 they begin dating. Instead of just marrying.-Phones. you cant call anyone! that would be cool!!!-go out. they should be able to leave the house. there should be grocery stores, etc.-Animations. more 3D,detailed, Animations and more common names.That's just what I think...bye!
A12I9A785A584L B00BXTTRO2 3 1375660800 21 uh... When i got it worked fine then it crashed! :( still trying to fix it....:/ so im not really sure
A12I9A785A584L B004SCR8QU 5 1395360000 47 This is the best drawing game ever! I love being able to draw in my own unique style. I love the many icons. I draw people and animals that are helping me get better at drawing! Nothing is better! (ok well maybe its not THAT good :D)
A12I9A785A584L B007L3M1W4 4 1380326400 39 OMG!!! I LOVE THIS GAME until the crash that is.i mean cmon! i updated the app 2 or 3 days ago and as soon as i knew it 2 of my favorite features where gone! its terrible dont update!
A12I9A785A584L B00A7Z8KAU 1 1395360000 27 I barely have any apps but still....I cant download this darn game! Why? why? WHHYYYYY?! I give it a one star due to my bad luck. grrrrrrrr
A12I9A785A584L B00DS86XPM 5 1388534400 21 this is a wonderful app. it makes drawing really hard things easy. I have mastered drawing Demi  Levato . great game.
A12I9A785A584L B0074W01II 5 1394841600 22 I love this game! dunno why I ever undownloaded it before: prob storage space!! haha never stop LOVIN ITTTTTTT. just So creative!
A12I9A785A584L B00CXP63BK 1 1377993600 43 I got the game . At first It was cool but u have to buy EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!! DO NOT listen to the good reviews!  All of the clothes u have to pay for! I HATE this game. DONT LET IT FOOL YOU!!!!! X (
A12I9A785A584L B00HFUNYWY 3 1394150400 26 This game is only ok. And I MEAN ONLY! The dress up is fun but the rest is pooh. I'm sorry peeps but this game sucks!
A12I9A785A584L B00CTXY8RC 1 1395446400 41 I think worldcraft (regular version)  is SO MUCH BETTER! Best game is not what I would call this. its really hard to chat and move even. Its not good so DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!! And highlight that.  JUST TRUST ME!
A12IB3OF77L323 B006OP8494 5 1363564800 25 This is the perfect tool for LDS members to use at church or at home or anywhere else. It has everything you need. love it!
A12IB3OF77L323 B008JGSM6G 5 1363564800 39 This game is totally addicting! Even the kids can do the simpler ones. My only complaint is that with the &#34;one click&#34; purchasing my kids buy &#34;hints&#34; whithout my knowledge so you have to keep an eye on that.
A12IB3OF77L323 B008NMT684 5 1363564800 51 My 2 year old son loves this game! He did want more than just the free puzzles though so I ended up buying the full thing, but it was only $1.99, totally worth it. The sound effects are great and he LOVES to pop the balloons after he finishes the puzzle.
A12ICBZU4ECN5V B00AMEFZ72 1 1395532800 19 Very very confusing. Too many options and not clear. You cannot just start playing without doingTesting so many options
A12ICBZU4ECN5V B008AZGWYK 3 1356393600 21 l was disappointed in this website because if you ask for more information they ask for a fee by a doctor
A12ICBZU4ECN5V B00ARI9CDQ 5 1373155200 20 Excellent tablet for all types of news sports politics entertainment etc.the response is fast .pictures are very clear and easy
A12ICBZU4ECN5V B004VA3X7M 5 1363046400 24 This is one of the best .com service that I have used. It it very thorough and covers in detail all of Zappos departments
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B00CAM8YL8 5 1390003200 41 I have an over active mind so finding my quiet place to meditate is taking longer than I care to admit, but I have been losing between using the app and Weight Watchers. Also my stress level is getting better.Thumbs up!
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B006RXD2I6 4 1404518400 15 Too much time by myself I think. Helps me through the boredom and meditative thinking.
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B0063GORYU 5 1391558400 23 Haven't had a problem with the app. Flows easy and works very well with Kindle Fire HD. I have become addicted to it.
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B0064X7FVE 4 1404518400 30 Close but not quite like watching on TV. I wish it had emergency WiFi for really bad weather when I am away from home. It has come in handy though.
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B008AZGWYK 3 1378944000 42 Works well enough. I am interested in the weight loss plan. Seems a big ordeal to get to the area for charting from my reader. I will be going on a cruise and hope that I can work with this aboard ship.
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B0094BB4TW 2 1399680000 69 So far it works alright. No instructions on how to begin. It's trial & error. I had stopped FB a couple of years ago then I was forced to go there again  by my home association so that we would know what was going on here. They still held on to ALL of my info. If you think you've ever closed your acct. & that you've deleted everything...think again.
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B0066T8SDU 3 1387065600 41 I had an older version that worked!!! In my Kindle Fire HD. The newer version was sent in to my system and has been freezing things up. Give me a break, please and give me back the old version.  Thank you.
A12IDDG3QN2M92 B0063IH60K 5 1393545600 26 Great graphics! Even with all of the ads. Thank goodness there is an automatic fill in at the end when all the cards are face up.
A12IE3GS7IDMLL B00C4OZ3CK 3 1386892800 60 A lot of the products that I scan come back with no answer. I'm hoping that I just happened to pick products that aren't in their system, but I really expected to be able to get more use out of it. I'm going to keep trying though because I think that it's a great thing to have if it works.
A12II0QJC4UGFU B004SJ3BCI 4 1338940800 85 The story is, some pigs decided to steal some eggs from a group of birds which have special abilities to destroy things in their own special  way. Your eyes will be glued to the screen untill you are forced to remove them, and even then you won't  be able to wait untill you play it once again.the levels are very challenging and the noise that the birds use as a battle  cry is a little annoying, but you definitely won't  regret purchasing  this game!! :)
A12II0QJC4UGFU B006OCM0G0 3 1338940800 23 very cool. v v v v v v h h h g h g v gbg v hbhbb b h h n j
A12II0QJC4UGFU B0086700CM 5 1338422400 20 i thought this game was super awesome. there's always  something  to work on. its so amazing. w w w w
A12ILZBLZ1I350 B00BP29SAA 5 1381795200 26 my grandson loves it. He is three and can operate it by himself. Many different levels that can keep him interested for at least an hour.
A12ILZBLZ1I350 B0091QS88K 2 1381795200 43 I find it very hard to use. The free addition only cooks two items. If it cooks more I can't figure it out. If I bought the complete full version, I hope it would be as good as the Dr. Panda's other games.
A12ILZBLZ1I350 B00EBQRSTK 5 1381795200 37 We are both playing this this game. I think it will help with memory and our vocabulary. It is the type of game that you can pick up and play just for five minutes or an hour.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B0089ZM1GY 4 1341446400 45 I just started playing the game and so far so good. Like I said the graphics are adorable. It is the FAOTD so try it yourself. What do you have to lose if you don't like it just uninstall it. Pretty simple wouldn't you agree
A12IN92QTETJT3 B004DPC5Y2 4 1336867200 46 This is a great game for preschoolers. My granddaughter and I have a lot of laughs playing this game. She loves the part where we get to pick the stickers.  The graphics are very good and the monkey is adorable. Great app for the little ones.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B006PHD0RW 4 1336867200 49 How cute is this game. My five year old granddaughter and I play this all the time. Might I just add I really don't think either one of us are going to be employed by your nearest grocery store anytime soon. You can relax---your groceries are safe for now
A12IN92QTETJT3 B0097GVJWQ 5 1347926400 62 I had a lot of fun playing this app. I will admit to hitting the hint button a few times though. The graphics are beautiful and the story line is interesting. The hidden objects part is fun also. Totally worth the $3.99 that it costs. I too can't wait for the next chapter of this game. Thanks Big Fish games. You rock.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B007TBHAOC 4 1355270400 37 My 5 year old grand daughter loves the colors. It is not to difficult to play. I would say most young children would enjoy this faotd. What the heck if you don't like it just uninstall it.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B005UQ9FNC 3 1325894400 84 My four year old granddaughter and I have a blast with this app. She greets me with a kiss and a (we have to take care of our birds grandma!!) She loves the responsability of taking care of those adorable little birds. I do however have a huge complaint about the fact that the site will ask you to restart it and restart it. Someone needs to address this problem NOW. If it wasn't for this glitche it would be a five star game.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B0067VKQLE 5 1336867200 22 What an addictive game. The graphics are awesome. Once you start playing it's so hard to stop. Try it you'll love it.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B008K6G8CK 4 1354752000 49 love the game. but the thing is I personally am not a awealthy woman.What to do? oh maybe the game makers can give us a little BREAK!!!!!! What do you think of those apples........HELP HELP. You know you have all the controls in yourfingers so lets posy GNC casinos.
A12IN92QTETJT3 B00AZL3PBK 5 1360540800 26 I really like the old school games so as you can guess I was pleased to see and play this game. Tons of fun for everyone.
A12IODTSK0Z8SX B00CZDSK7K 5 1392854400 49 It is so cool you start with your own family and you will get emails and sometimes it is a marrige proposal and you can accept it or reject it.And you can buy renovations to make the house nicer and they can have children and it is so fun.
A12IODTSK0Z8SX B00D2K40WY 4 1372118400 39 I got it and it said it would be free but when I got it I could only you se one person and there where barely and any thing you could do if you didn't BUY the full version.
A12IODTSK0Z8SX B009HKL4B8 4 1387065600 34 At first it is kind of confusing but after a while you will start getting in to it and I got help from my friend her name is hope in case you know her.

A12IODTSK0Z8SX B00FAPF5U0 5 1399507200 56 I love this app it is so fun to play on you get a number of live for example if you have five lives and you play it once it does not take down any lives it takes a while so you can play it for a long time it is very addictive I lover it.
A12IPDCL6U5Q3I B004UID2LC 5 1368316800 22 Get this! I got this and there's no viruses. I just easily download a video and it goes on my camera! Amazing
A12IPDCL6U5Q3I B00821L076 5 1375228800 21 This game is awesome and its a great time killer. I play it every day and you should get it to.
A12IPDCL6U5Q3I B00AB7HESI 5 1376265600 36 I begged my mom to get me this and she did. I was super happy. I only have 1 complaint. You have to pay another .99 to unlock more levels but it's a great time killer.
A12IPDCL6U5Q3I B009HKL4B8 5 1372723200 39 Hi I'm playing this game and I absolutely love it! You create sims and have sims make friends and enemies. You should get it and play it. If your not on for a while your sims will become unhappy.
A12IPDCL6U5Q3I B00A9NXGAO 5 1364947200 22 I am in LOVE with this game! I REALLY need friends and no one likes me. So pretty please add me! UBPB9
A12IPDCL6U5Q3I B00DJFIMW6 5 1389312000 56 OMG I loooooooooooove this game!!! It's such a good game! It's kinda like Subway Surfers but a little bit better! (Sorry if your a huge Subway Surfers fan!!!) I love the movie too! Ever since the Christmas update, it's better than ever! New characters, they even added Paradise Mall!!! I truly and REALLY recommend this game.
A12IPLJOSRB28J B00DJFIMW6 5 1395964800 23 This game is so much fun. I love it so much because of the minions and the places are so cool and fun.
A12IPLJOSRB28J B00BC4I19U 5 1396915200 21 This game is so much fun and is not really for toddlers but for all ages and you get power ups!!!!!!:):)
A12IRWTSRPD754 B009WJNXAE 5 1363219200 22 This game is totally awesome. Feels good to play no go and have some old bag next to you Heilongjiang before you
A12IRWTSRPD754 B00B2TET3C 5 1362614400 22 Here's a game that's worth having. It makes this awesome game great to play anytime. Most definitely not your G-Ma' s bingo
A12IRWTSRPD754 B0087TQYUG 5 1362182400 20 Awesome game enjoy playing it with my Facebook friends. You really gotta play this especially if you Facebook friends do
A12ISN624IFGU4 B009UX2YAC 5 1360368000 21 Great and addicting game! I would definitely download this! My favorite game ever! Great for all ages not gender specific either!
A12ISN624IFGU4 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1391299200 25 Its challenging but fun, if you like solving puzzles with a time limit then this is your game. I highly recommend trying out this game.
A12IVB87XJ30Y9 B007F2EGFQ 3 1366761600 104 A fantasy town you can build yourself with pets, houses, shops an more.It takes a long time to build up gold and forever to build up rubies essential to fulfilling goals unless you purchase them with a lot of real money. This 'free' game will not let you progress far unless you're willing to pay a lot. I will never buy another Gameloft game with this type of 'customer service'. I recommend to all people who just want to enjoy a game without strings not to buy their games. There are plenty of great games out there you only have to pay for once.
A12J4WQR3GL81C B008IXP8IU 5 1391472000 44 at first i thought it may be too hard. but its fun and i like how u have to figure it out...as u find words those letters go out of the choice area...so the letters left behind are for the remaining words only...nice game...
A12J4WQR3GL81C B00BL0I7WG 4 1397606400 27 there is no real music to go with the game...but it is fun anyway...some scenes are a bit dark and finding the object is harder that way...
A12J4WQR3GL81C B00E8KLWB4 4 1395100800 25 like the game but dont want to pay...the game goes through too many explanations...u have to wait to play if u dont want to pay...
A12J4WQR3GL81C B006VW94HQ 4 1391299200 20 i love the game hate the pop ups ...its not easy but not too hard either...glad i got it...good fun...
A12J4WQR3GL81C B00ALKKM98 1 1388448000 26 the game worked once and now it will not come on.... I want to delete it and cant seem to find a way to do it....
A12J4WQR3GL81C B00CRHF748 4 1390435200 27 its good.... I play it once in a while .... not easy but not hard....there are other games I play more such as solitaire and word games
A12J7WRG7G1I1D B005UQ9FNC 5 1333497600 23 Just one think all my apps got races on my kindle and I need to find how to down load my regal app.
A12J7WRG7G1I1D B00AVGGYNA 5 1366761600 22 I just love the game its great for the doctors office.my kids love the game to. We play it all the time.
A12J9BBVKURNHM B0094FYBB6 5 1374105600 24 Excellent way to improve your memory and ward off preliminary indications of dementia. Increases wordpower and allows you to improve your health and memory.
A12J9BBVKURNHM B005V1N71W 5 1374105600 23 Although somewhat limited,this service is the best provider of music to a generation of individuals tired of excessive fees from providers like Sirius.
A12J9BBVKURNHM B005ZFOOE8 5 1384214400 20 Better than Pandora. This free service provided clear channel music and out distances the compition by a mile. Good work,.
A12J9BBVKURNHM B009VSW15Y 3 1384214400 72 Don't use it much as the Kindle cannot change the direction of the lense, which in of itself, makes this software highly unusable. Additionally, the Kindle has it's own camera setup, which those inadequate, does okay for spur of the moment shots. That is if you can turn the Kindle and hold it, and capture the subject, while trying to center the subject, without looking at the screen. Good luck with that.
A12J9BBVKURNHM B0064X7B4A 5 1374105600 24 Increases word power and mental health. Interaction between the participants allows users to improve their vocabulary, memory and ward off preliminary indications of dementia..
A12J9VTM67ZFPV B004DLNC4I 5 1318550400 109 First let's make one thing clear. The application has NO control over what channels are available. The people rating it 1 star need to read.The scanner itself works great. It uses an online provider to get its data, which receives its data from individual enthusiasts.It is great to use for killing the time or listening to local events. It may be a data hog but there isn't really an easy way around it from a code point of view. Nonetheless, this application is worth the increased data use. If you have a wifi connection of unlimited data like myself there really is no reason to avoid downloading this application.
A12J9VTM67ZFPV B004OZOTSQ 5 1321056000 101 This app works great. Any feature I want for file exploring is available here. Now, many people have been complaining about there not bring an exit button but there is actually an exit button now. Just press menu --&gt; exit.The app can sometimes run a little slow, though. Not sure if my wifi is the culprit or if the app needs some attention.All in all, it works like I would expect it to and I don't really see any big problems with it. The picture viewing and media player are handy as well (when you are exploring a folder with media).
A12JC1QC4LSR15 B006QZM73Q 4 1327795200 29 This game is really good and simple. Although sometimes when you press a word, it doesn't take you to sections of the game. But other than that, it's flawless!
A12JC1QC4LSR15 B007TNQ7EY 2 1371254400 55 glitches and not enough money you can barely make anything without doing missions witch are absolutely no fun don't waste your money buy the real gta its way better this is nothing but a knock off and waste of time and money I only bought it because I couldn't take my console on a plane
A12JC1QC4LSR15 B00CZDSK7K 4 1373932800 48 This game is fantastic. I highly reccomend it for anyone who likes to control people and run a family. I am in my 5th generation in the game and I'm not really that bored. But after a while it gets a wee bit boring but its pretty fun.
A12JCM5NMFUA0O B00AH3B7X4 5 1356393600 20 I LOVE this game....its so much fun on my kindle fire I cant stop playing it...y'all have to get it...
A12JCM5NMFUA0O B00BM7HD4Q 4 1364428800 23 Shogi monsters is like pok&egrave;mon on steroids....it makes cool look cooler.I really Love this game but I think id prefer something more extreme...
A12JCM5NMFUA0O B009DCOU9S 5 1375574400 20 this game is more fun than the first one....and the hidden items are a little harder to find.....I would recommend.
A12JEX08AI8AYB B0063222V4 3 1393286400 30 Seem to work well wish it had more information on getting rid or what would cause them to nest in various area's .Or how to prevent infections in certain areas.
A12JEX08AI8AYB B0096YJDNQ 4 1390953600 74 Seems to work very well set up is sometimes difficult but worth it I'm not as good on computer as many of you are but figuring it out is half the battle. Did not like what Amazon did they put it on as 5,99 with 180 coins free I had some coins on my account ,but instead of taking them off they charged me and gave me 180 more on what I presently had.
A12JHKQERWHDBR B004RCHGRC 5 1358985600 24 This app works great. I play with friends and strangers, it's always fun. I like that I can chat with friends while playing, too.
A12JHKQERWHDBR B00702PZME 5 1395446400 43 This game is a lot of fun and it keeps your brain engaged. I always think I'll play a couple of games, but end up staying much longer than planned. I like it because it's something I can do alone. I recommend it.
A12JHKQERWHDBR B005ZXWMUS 5 1366761600 45 I love Netflix. I hated when people were talking nasty about them a couple of years back. I mostly just use the DVD rental since I have Verizon and Verizon doesn't give us enough bandwidth to stream movies, unfortunately. Netflix revolutionized how we rent movies.
A12JHKQERWHDBR B008XG1X18 5 1359158400 30 I love Pinterest, but I especially love using it on the Kindle. Everything works smoothly and I haven't seen any glitchiness at all. I love it and highly recommend it.
A12JHKQERWHDBR B0061S5NNO 5 1366761600 52 I love this app! I have it on my pc, my Kindle, and my smartphone. It's easy to use, has a great database of foods to choose from, automatically gives you nutrient information, and best of all (to me) is that it isn't glitchy in the least. It works great every time!
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B0088QDDDY 1 1348617600 30 really wanted to like it based on the other reviews, but after 10 minutes I wanted to stick a pencil in my eye because it would have been more fun...uninstalled.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B004N8R576 3 1313193600 79 Not too bad...definitely better than some, but not as good a others. Its a nice tine killer. I would recommend to the developers that there be more time at the end of the game to actually read the &quot;hints&quot; (seemed to only read half the hint before it went to the main menu). I would recommend trying it and if you get bored then un install it. Oh and the permissions are very low(unlike some other games).  Droid 2
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B0052UZIFA 5 1306800000 34 I've wasted hours playing the PC version, new I will do the same on my phone. This is an awesome game...even  better than Angry Birds. Works without any problems on my Droid 2...highly recommend!!!!
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B005DO1N2W 4 1330214400 29 While I don't buy into horoscopes, I do find this app fun. It is ready to use and thoroughly breaks the month into thirds for a more refined horoscope.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B005AKPLYK 2 1312588800 36 This was one of my favorite  game apps when I downloaded it last month. Game play  and graphics were awesome. However the recent &quot;update&quot; now causes it to freeze on my Droid 2 making it unplayable.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B004RCUJ9E 5 1318723200 28 I like the options and the different levels. This makes you think and is more complex than other games. I highly recommend this game and specifically this app.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B004UMMWVY 3 1305072000 46 After installation, I quickly realized that Google Calendar (which also includes Tasks) does the same thing. With this program, I can only see the data on my phone. With Google, I  can see it from my phone out any computer. Thanks anyway, but had to uninstall.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B0058P7KUA 4 1310083200 28 Controls take Some getting used to. If you  find carnage fun then this is for you.  Lots of killing. For free, its worth it for sure.  Droid 2
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B007Z4AKQI 1 1336435200 48 As with all Glu games, this is unplayable after 30 minutes without spending a significant amount of real money.  The play is very slow, controls are poor, and you have to spend more time in the shop upgrading than actually playing. Not recommended at all...un installed very quickly.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B004TA2F14 4 1305331200 48 The name is a bit misleading since it does more than shopping for groceries. I like the flexibility of making sub-lists that are separate from the main list. I'll keep this app and see how it holds up after a few shopping trips over the next few months.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B00DQR26EC 2 1390608000 55 Using an HTC Rezound the controls are frustrating and a total pain in the a$$. After 20 minutes I uninstalled the app. Movement in the game was fine, but operating menus/equipping items was horrendous. If the controls were to be fixed then the game could be good, but until then I can't recommend this game.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B0064ETS1I 5 1330560000 32 Great interface, easy to understand, yet with increasingly challenging levels. I would recommend this as an alternative to the run of the mill games out there. Definitely worth a buck our two.
A12JIJOX2RHJNJ B0050KEVO6 2 1311206400 28 It is interesting at first (sorry, but can't call it fun)...but then it gets boring quickly. Try it if you want, but I  un installed it relatively quickly.
A12JIQFWKKQBU0 B009WJNXAE 5 1379116800 25 I already liked and played  Bingo Bash on my Kindle, but now I really enjoy it sincethe games been revised..much more fun!!!Can play for hours!!!
A12JIQFWKKQBU0 B00A6GNC1M 5 1383004800 58 I play this game every morning, along with 2 other bingo games...It's a exciting game on my kindle fire..however, it some times freezes my kindle upon clicking on the game...I keep going back to it until it initiates the game...it's not my kindle...game seems to have problems at the start up of the game...happy when problem is fixed....
A12JIQFWKKQBU0 B0064X7B4A 5 1363219200 35 I and my friends love this game...can't wait to play...I have no problems with words on my kindle fire :-D...I have the ads, hit the back key and it skips them..really like the update too..
A12JIQFWKKQBU0 B00CMF27DE 4 1378080000 29 If you love Bingo , this one is a keeper!! It will keep you coming back for more...go back twice a day for more chips..this game is so entertaining!!!!
A12JIQFWKKQBU0 B006OC2ANS 5 1334793600 23 Great fighting game for kindle and an insane.amount of stuff to buy. if you like rpg games, this is the game for you!
A12JIQFWKKQBU0 B00B2TET3C 4 1378080000 26 Tired of downloading a Bingo game, just to delete it later...this one will keep you entertained....the cat has a secret too...just tap behind the ears...truely enjoyable!!!!
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B00HHBXYGM 5 1390348800 32 Better than candy crush.  I love playing a match three this way.  It lets you match jewels that are just touching, they don't have to be in a row.  Lots of fun.
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B008K3OOJM 4 1346198400 22 not very exciting, but my son loves it, so it's a keeper . it's easy to use and beautiful to look at.
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B007PTJOV0 5 1334620800 20 most free games I have tried have been garbage but this one is really fun.  I would recommend. to everyone.
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B008JJS6D2 4 1346198400 22 I really like it, but I wish you could win more of the collections instead of having to buy most of them.
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B00A4KVFLY 5 1356998400 25 this game is so much fun. it really is just like the Tv show. I love how I can play with all my facebook friends.
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B00A3E2BVE 5 1359504000 26 Ssssoooooo addicting. I play all my friends on facebook, it is way to much fun.I love music and trivia, so this game was made for me.
A12JJFPQZ480EJ B00FAPF5U0 5 1387238400 22 A wonderfully amazing and entertaining game.  If it wasn't for my kids, I would never stop playing, but thank goodness for naptime.
A12JKS8J36CPF2 B00BXPQN2K 5 1369353600 25 This game is super fun. It has good graphics, the story is fun, and the actual game is fun in general. You should buy it.
A12JKS8J36CPF2 B007NACZPI 5 1332806400 39 I really like this game! whenever I come home from school the first thing I do is play tiny village. I like how you can design your billage and how you can pit things were ever you want them.
A12JKS8J36CPF2 B006U0Y07I 5 1340064000 50 I love this game it is so fun! it makes you concentrate and it passes time well. the ghosts look awesome and very real. its tough to find the objects that you are looking for though and that is part of what makes it so fun. over all wonderful game!!!
A12JKS8J36CPF2 B007D2XSW0 5 1356480000 23 I have no complaints about this app at all. It makes all pics look great! Need more words so blah blah blah blah!!
A12JO7L16KZ4TS B00I10HCV6 5 1396396800 20 Fun to play and kind of addictive!  If you like these kinds of games you will definitely love this one!
A12JO7L16KZ4TS B00G357N92 5 1396396800 23 I love all these chef games but this one is by far my favorite and the most addictive!  I really enjoy playing it!
A12JO7L16KZ4TS B00JV858HM 5 1400112000 24 Great game, makes you think just the right amount without making it impossible for the average person to play!  Fun to play together too!
A12JO7L16KZ4TS B00CXBSYVG 5 1398211200 23 Fun and easy game to play.  Lots of options I haven't used yet but it's fun even when you start in free mode.
A12JRLR467HI0A B009NTJRQM 1 1367107200 64 I thought this looked fun, so I downloaded it . When I opened the app it was working then it froze my kindle. I couldn't lock it nor exit the app. I had to turn my kindle off then back on. When I turned it back on I was exited out of the app. Then I deleted the app from my cloud. DON'T DOWNLOAD
A12JRLR467HI0A B006PH7WBM 5 1358812800 37 I love this game i had it on my iPod touch but when I got my kindle fire for Christmas I was so happy they had it in the app store. I would recommend this for kids.
A12JRXQ6IY8EGM B00BIK524A 3 1389830400 21 Beautiful graphics but after level 32 you must pay to continue playing. But overall very relaxing and the music is sweet
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B004FOA84A 5 1303344000 58 this game works great on my Evo Andy wifes Evo Shift, I see the negative reviews are coming from those with lower end devices like the Optimus V etc... The big problem with some of the apps on the Amazon app store is the inability for it to  distinguish properly if it will run properly on each device...
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B004N2NWT2 5 1303344000 30 This game is a really good time killer and is also a lot of fun to have at family get togethers as you can see who is the biggest &quot;Moron&quot;
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B008CFVG58 1 1370736000 57 The problem is that it seems to glitch out and the servers won't do what you want them to do. Also to earn Garfield coins the tasks seem to be almost impossible for the most part. If this game was updated and made the goals a bit easier at times this would be a 5 star game...
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B00E616R5Q 1 1383523200 26 The game is rigged to make you buy coins, would be a fun game but please make it easier to win without having to spend money...
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B005F9Z2G8 5 1312934400 50 For all those complaining about ads, don&apos;t forget you got it for free. Secondly it is not a fear based news source it just is not MSNBC. People seem to complain so much on here about Amazons free app of the day if it isn&apos;t exactly what they were wanting.
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B004SC3BLG 5 1327276800 45 The app does exactly what it says it should and does it well, this should prove to be quite useful! Now for &quot;superman&quot; it is a real shame that amazon will not allow you to flag reviews as spam as that is what his are.
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B004SBS8LA 5 1301184000 27 You've heard the hype now try it... Fun game that helps to pass the time when you are bored... nothing more to say...SERIOUSLY AMAZON? 25 WORD MINIMUM!
A12JTEUWNJ9OSR B006ON41FC 1 1329523200 24 I never use open Feint and so would appreciate you not automatically running it. also the app freezes a lot on my EVO 3d...
A12JTFKBQ6S9DK B00FAPF5U0 4 1390089600 20 my children can play this game (3 and 4) but it gets very addictive for adults. it is pretty fun!
A12JTFKBQ6S9DK B006P0A5KO 4 1325376000 26 Fun game would be great for a beginner. The games are a bit easy but I atoll really enjoyed it. Good for kids of all ages
A12JTFKBQ6S9DK B0085VR7WU 5 1368662400 21 Great game to play if u like farkle. Just be careful you can lose track of time very easily. Have fun
A12JV97RDL7LZC B00DJFIMW6 5 1376092800 24 I got this game for the kids but I play all the time too. Great way to pass the time on a rainy day
A12JV97RDL7LZC B00GOZQ2E8 5 1396483200 25 Different then all the other build a town games. Lots of extra stuff to do...and it doesn't take 6-12 hours to do one thing....big plus
A12JV97RDL7LZC B00HDRTGDK 5 1392163200 27 Love this game. Brings back a lot of memories. Completely forgot about some of this stuff. It's a must have if you grew up in the 90s
A12JV97RDL7LZC B00ANH526W 3 1372377600 67 I got this game a few days ago and I like the idea of the game. It's actually kind of fun. The problem is you just don't make enough money. So I paid to have in game money but I never received it. That was 2 days ago. So I gave it 3 stars. If I get what I paid for I will change it to 5
A12JV97RDL7LZC B00ED4TX2A 3 1382400000 55 I only gave this game three stars because even tho it is an awesome game unfortunately I can't play it half the time unless I have the patience to try to get it to open for an hour. Hope the update fixes this problem as I would love to be able to play it again.
A12K15QXJW7F5S B009WJNXAE 3 1388534400 23 It's an ok fun game but gets boring quick. Find it to rhythmic get old fast. Same amount of credits goes to quick.
A12K15QXJW7F5S B009KS4XRO 5 1388534400 23 This is a addictive game. Only prob is there isn't enough daily credits. Would like to have more do I can play more.
A12K15QXJW7F5S B00FAPF5U0 5 1388534400 20 Like having challenge of levels. Drives me crazy cant get past level 125. Fun game  fun levels. I love it...
A12K2KQF732ZK2 B006MK63XK 5 1335830400 21 I love it really fun. I wish it had more guns and I wish it was easier. but overall pretty good.
A12K2KQF732ZK2 B0067Q4DPE 4 1337126400 29 just started. like the graphics. the little game person keeps telling me what a good job I'm doing. gonna stop writing this review so I can play some more.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B0086700CM 5 1338249600 66 I love temple run soooooo much it is sooooooo awesome I'm sooooooo glad its out it took a while for it to come out but I got it early I downloaded it online. If you gave this one, two or even three stars you are an idiot, a technological dinosaur or there is something wrong with your device.BTW this is my moms account I'm a kid
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B00876UUN6 5 1341532800 66 This is a really awesome game.You travel through the zodiac islands, fighting and capturing mogas to complete quests and make your fighting team bigger and more powerful.The goal of the entire game is to collect enough mogas to defeat evil king Otho.To unlock each island, you must beat the previous island and capture enough mogas.There are IAP's, but you can  beat the game without purchasing anything.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B008CG839O 5 1341273600 58 This game is really fun. It is similar to It Girl, which I love to play on facebook. I'm not sure what the people who say it crashes are talking about. Maybe because its K fire version if you download it on something else it crashes. I don't know. If you have a kindle fire, get this game!!!
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B0088QGB7Y 5 1339977600 56 I really like this game.It is fun and I love feeling like I have a smurf village in my hand.I have been waiting for it to come out on KF and now it is here.And if you save up your berries and just wait for things to grow or build, you wont have to spend money.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B00B2V66VS 4 1361491200 140 When this app first came out, I was excited and rushed to get it. It's a lot cooler than temple run and it's free. I mean, how many apps this awesome are free? I loved it and played it a lot. But then about a three weeks after I got it, it stopped working. I tried to open it and it went to the Imangi studios screen. It stayed there for about 30 seconds and I thought it was loading. Then the screen went blank and it went back to the home screen. I tried multiple times to open it and this happened every time. I waited a few days, tried to open it, and the same thing happened. Maybe there is a glitch in the K Fire version, or is everyone having this problem? Or is it just me?
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B0064DBE9I 2 1336435200 28 it seems interesting, but when I tried to download it, it wouldn't download right and I had to re-download it many times, then it crashed my kindle fire!
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B00A3WTXQ2 4 1361577600 78 I really like this game. A friend recommended it, so I got it. It is adorable and pointless, but really addicting. I like the fact that you can customize your dessert. The one thing that bugs me is that every now and then after ypu die an almost full screen ad pops up. I'm usually not expecting it and naturally tap the screen to play again, and click the ad. Over all it is an adorable, addicting game.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B007SPQ04A 5 1341619200 50 NO WAY!I cant believe it.There is actually a faotd that doesn't have IAPs.This is incredible.Also its a really good game the graphics are cute and fun, and its really entertaining.I bought this yesterday when it was the faotd, but was so busy playing I didn't write the review until today.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B0085N9I84 5 1338595200 38 I really like this game.Sometimes its a little laggy but overall it has cute graphics and is really awesome.I like it because how fun it is to challenge your friends on who can grow their park the biggest.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B005JT3YNC 3 1334793600 21 the game itself is cool and fun because you get to design ur own cupcake. but floating icing is not cool.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B007693VXG 3 1334793600 36 I haven't downloaded the game yet but it sounds interesting... and for all u babies who complain about how bad it is and that it takes up space on ur device you should just delete it.
A12K45Q5YUNFKS B008Y7SMQU 4 1349049600 32 I liked this app, it was interesting to guess the logos.My one problem is that it uses some logos that are not widely known, which makes it hard.Other than that,  its fun!
A12K9EQCG2QFXJ B004UBB1HQ 5 1367539200 64 I have used ComiCat on both my original Kindle Fire and my new Kindle Fire 8.9 and it works with no problems on both. There are plenty of settings to choose from and I have had no issues with it. I like. that I can set it to enhanse an older comic to bring out the Color and detail. I highly recommend this app!
A12K9EQCG2QFXJ B009C7ZQM4 5 1376092800 47 A great app for cleaning up my  memory &amp; storage on my Kindle and my Kindle HD.The first time I ran it on my oridginal Kindle it cleaned up between 2 and 3 gigs of space. I've had no problems with Clean Master and  highly recommend it!
A12K9EQCG2QFXJ B0066T8M1I 5 1326153600 21 If you like Monopoly you really get this game. The game play is quite good, and the rules can be customized.
A12K9EQCG2QFXJ B004SZ1U66 5 1344211200 44 I have no idea what the negitive reviews are about. I got this for free and I think its great.There is an Option to buy added tools later in the game, but so what. Its fun, there's no time limit,and no mess. Great App!
A12K9EQCG2QFXJ B004HXHVZ8 5 1325635200 24 Flixter is a great app for keeping up to date on movies in my local theater and what Dvd,s are being released.Two thumbs up.!!
A12KDPZKGRFOR B009NOQG9S 1 1370649600 22 It crashed minecraft I had to delete it from my cloud do NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAMESo just save your space and minecraft
A12KDPZKGRFOR B00CPPXYC4 5 1370995200 39 This game is awesome and a few weeks ago I was playing a glu gameAnd I wanted credts and it said free money now so I clicked on itAnd it wanted me to download this and I said yes
A12KF96SMOWJS9 B00DJFIMW6 5 1390521600 21 This is a cute game  for our Despicable Me lovers. My little girl loves playing this game...I highly recommend this app.
A12KF96SMOWJS9 B009O2XY12 3 1385769600 44 This little app would be great and my little girl loves it but it don't give you enough bubbles. Once you run out you have to wait 30 more minutes to play again. Unless you want to purchase more with the constant annoying ads.
A12KF96SMOWJS9 B00JTKDTLE 4 1400371200 52 This game is fun. But if your easy to get headaches you might not want to play it much. The first time I played it I got a really bad headache watching the tiles. Other than that the game is really fun and I really like the music that the tiles play.
A12KF96SMOWJS9 B0091937MO 5 1374537600 88 &quot;I got this cute little app for my 7 year old little girl. Since then, I have played it more than her. It really is so much fun. And you can't put it down once you start playing.. And it's FREE! Which makes it that much better.. I highly recommended this app and all the other apps that show up at the bottom of your screen, that is similar to this one. I GUARANTEE that you and your children will love it, if you give it the chance!
A12KF96SMOWJS9 B009ZZDNT6 5 1384732800 53 This comes in so handy app especially when the power goes out. This is a great backup! You choose the time you want up and it will stay on the same time for as many days as you set it for. You only have to set it one time. Highly recommend this app!...:)
A12KI8M6MC4FJV B009HKL4B8 4 1383350400 27 this game is good for killing time the only complaint I have is it takes to long to gain enough credits to purchase items and level up
A12KI8M6MC4FJV B00GTXFOIA 4 1385424000 29 I think this is a good game easy to get credits excellent bonus rounds good for killing time even getting 2000 credits for a review is a good bonus
A12KQ2CAFP7039 B004SCR8QU 5 1395705600 24 Like SketchBook Pro, SketchBook Mobile Express is a great tool for artists. It's similar to SketchBook Pro. Like SketchBook Pro, it's easy and fun.
A12KQ2CAFP7039 B00DZJ4O2S 4 1401926400 30 My sister got a similar game for her Kindle Fire. I was trying to find that same game. I didn't find it but I found this, and it's pretty cool.
A12KQ2CAFP7039 B007XKEY6Q 5 1363737600 31 I'm an artist, and this is the first game I've gotten on my Kindle Fire. It's great to have a game that puts my artistic talent to use. Also, it's free.
A12KQ2CAFP7039 B004SJ3BCI 5 1367366400 34 I'd heard about this game, so I decided to get it free for my Kindle Fire. It's a very simple game, but it's also very fun. The characters funny. I really enjoy Angry Birds.
A12KR4WGULH36A B00A6S051A 5 1391904000 43 You should totally get this app. I'm moving soon and my best friend is very sad. I'm going to surprise her with a PIC COLLAGE to make her feel better. Get this app if you like art and creating fun pieces of art.
A12KR4WGULH36A B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392681600 93 I just got the app and I already love it. My friend has the original app Flappy Bird and I really liked it. I told her I was going to get the app and she said it was taken off the Appstore. I was so disappointed. Then I saw Flappy Wings. I read some reviews and it sounded really good. I got the app and I can't stop playing it. And this app is FREE! Even better. Get this app. I totally recommend it if you like Flappy Bird. :) ;) x) :D
A12KW2BQXS8VS9 B00GIZO674 5 1387670400 54 I just got this app today and I have almost beaten it. It isn't hard and it is fun. You get to live the life of a person trying to build a business. It is very fun and I suggest that you buy it ,I mean it's free what is there to loose ?
A12KW2BQXS8VS9 B007FVIX4C 2 1333497600 36 Now if you really want this app so bad go buy an I -pod because the reviews for this don't look so good . By the reviews I don't think I will be getting this app.
A12KW2BQXS8VS9 B007JYI4SU 1 1333584000 24 This thing lied to me, my friends dog died and it told my friend it was exited while she was in cry mode......little liar.
A12KW2BQXS8VS9 B00FCYEZOQ 5 1387670400 50 I am very happy with this app. Although, I haven't used it for that long I love it . It is fun to trivia with and good for parties.If you know your logos than your sure to love this.If you get this app I guarantee that you will like it.
A12KW2BQXS8VS9 B0066W1AZK 4 1333584000 66 When I was younger my uncle taught me how to play chess and we would always play it when I saw him, he would always win. After I moved away I only see maybe 5 times a year and he has bad health and we just stopped playing chess with me this game brings back happy memories and I also love playing chess no matter what.
A12KXMJ1QN6VJ5 B00IKZX1ZI 5 1397174400 25 I purchased the game for my 4yr old but I play it more than she does.  It is a good time waster.  Lots of fun
A12KXMJ1QN6VJ5 B00EBE8MUG 4 1399507200 28 I AM TOTALLY ENJOYING THIS GAME.  I GOT IT TODAY AN I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN.  THE BEGINNING IS FAIRLY EASY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HARDER PUZZLES
A12KXMJ1QN6VJ5 B00A9JG6RS 4 1370995200 28 I had this game on my phone first and was addicted to it.  So naturally when I saw it in the app store I had to have it.
A12KXMJ1QN6VJ5 B005ZFOOE8 5 1388793600 35 I instantly loved this app.  The music that came on were the songs I loved. This app is great.  I can compare it to other online music and I still feel that it is better.
A12KXMJ1QN6VJ5 B00CKW6FVE 4 1387756800 22 A good time wasting game.  I regularly play and enjoy it.  Good fun for the kids.  The updated graphics are good also
A12KXWXT2DNB5I B00992CF6W 5 1364342400 69 this is the BEST game ever. It is a bit bad though because i had to completly shut down my kindle before i could play any of my maps and now the game doesent evem work! i have tryed 23 times to get to play my game and it is stuck in the cloud. i blame the minecraft people for that last part. it should be fixed by now.
A12KXWXT2DNB5I B0066W1AZK 4 1372723200 34 this app is spoon fun but the computer hallways skips moves that a actual person would do like they don't take my free queen or move their queen. if that gets fixed 5 stars.
A12KZXMN32YSO3 B00GGQLZUG 5 1398902400 34 This app is a lot of fun! I've never had to buy coins, play often, and it's never stopped unexpectedly on me ! Thanks for the fun way to pass some time and relax!
A12KZXMN32YSO3 B00FOW265Q 5 1393113600 25 This is a fun and challenging word game! Good for passing time while exercising the brain! Love it! Encourage others to give it a try!
A12L8NYKONKWGK B007OXASB2 5 1333929600 40 Cute and addicting game. Just wish it didn't take so long to breed and build pens. Also wish that you didn't need jems so much. There should be NO tasks that require jems to complete. Spending jems should be optional.
A12L8NYKONKWGK B006OC2ANS 5 1333670400 25 Graphics and tunctionality are amazing. Very addictive and fun. Hard to believe it is a free app. I am very impressed with this game. :)
A12L8NYKONKWGK B008Y0REKC 4 1352419200 22 Very cute. Al little hard to remeber evreything at first and waiting sucks but other than that is is a nice game.
A12L9J074TD7VF B00FZUF5VY 4 1385164800 23 So far this has been a fun game. The graphics are great. The pay outs are pretty decent also. I recommend this one.
A12L9J074TD7VF B007Z4AKQI 5 1380758400 23 This is a great game! I love the graphics. It's a little hard to hold the aim still, but overall a fun time!
A12L9J074TD7VF B00FAX6XQC 4 1388275200 24 This is a great game. The graphics are great. I like the options to upgrade in the game to give you a better chance.
A12L9J074TD7VF B00HKF00UI 4 1388966400 25 This game is pretty exciting. The wins are kind of few and far between, however. It's ok for sitting around and wasting a little time.
A12LCVWV1SPSUV B00FEMJF6O 5 1400976000 22 Loved this game on Facebook...so loving that I can get it on my Kindle now!!  I'm going to be so busy!!  LOL
A12LCVWV1SPSUV B0066TUXU6 4 1381363200 107 I understood having the commercials on the regular Hulu....but when I pay $7.99/month, I honestly think the ads should be removed. I noticed on the kids shows they are gone, but not on the regular shows.  And I have noticed a lot of the shows I want to watch are only available on the web or cannot be instant streamed.  What good is spending the money if all this is going on? I currently don't have any regular tv service. We go through Netflix and hulu plus exclusively. It would be wonderful if hulu would fix these few issues and make it more of an enjoyable experience!!!
A12LCVWV1SPSUV B00BXPQN2K 5 1393200000 20 So far I'm hooked!! The missions are fun and the graphics are pretty good. Seems to run smoothly so far!!
A12LCVWV1SPSUV B00H59CTW6 5 1394928000 35 I enjoy playing this game when I have nothing to do while waiting on my kids to get out of activities or such. Since it doesn't need internet, I can play it on the go.
A12LCVWV1SPSUV B00HAS1AKY 5 1395100800 23 Fun way to pass the time! My kids actually know a few of these as well!!  I'll be playing this on the airport!
A12LFNZ9RGWJZ4 B007PTJOV0 4 1364083200 49 This is a great game.  A lot like Mario bros. I just wish they would have more characters . I thought they were going to introduce some new characters  in leps world 2 but they didn't. I still think it's a great game and personally better than number 2.
A12LFNZ9RGWJZ4 B005HSL626 1 1364083200 35 Well I can't really say more about this game. IT SUCKS! The whole time you just slice fruit BORING! I wouldn't pay a penny for this game! If I could rate zero stars I would!
A12LFNZ9RGWJZ4 B00IZJLRQE 4 1405382400 24 A good free app,but would not spend money on it got it as free app of the day and its just like flappy bird.
A12LFNZ9RGWJZ4 B008TQ16OG 4 1385251200 20 Fun but should be free on kindle fire other than that it is very entertaining game and fun to play.
A12LFNZ9RGWJZ4 B00AEORXR0 4 1392422400 24 Needs a update its a lot better on computer. It is still a good app but I would Give 5 stars if it updates.
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B008Y7SMQU 5 1350604800 22 this Is very fun and challenging it has lots of logos I know and don't anybody know how to spell Hershey's chocalate
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B009PSV1HE 5 1351987200 26 This app is very fun and I love it.. I love how u can do what ever u want. This game is so intreging and different
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B0080IOHLW 5 1345420800 32 I totally recommend this app it is totally awesome!! it is fun for little ones to play also..... I love this game although it kind of gets annoying its still fun though
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B00B6P6Z48 1 1361145600 38 I got this game for my daughter bandit ended up costing to buy the dolls and the food and everything in it. this app has a lot of hidden costs and ways you kids can end up paying.
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B00FCYEZOQ 5 1385683200 25 Love it!!! Its such an easy game and it can be quite challenging!!! I love it and ive only had it for 2 days already
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B007ZGO7EM 5 1346889600 21 this app is so amazing it helps me every day with my home work..... it save me a lot of time
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B00FXKHEK6 5 1385683200 20 its a fun and entertaining app!! one down side is its really wash and not very hard obviously.  so ya(:
A12LGJA8UJN2H2 B006GIX2MI 5 1351900800 32 This game is very fun u get to make your own cities and u control it u are always making money and u never stop even when u are off the game
A12LIH1OJZIDKZ B00B4G3MV8 1 1375747200 21 Couldn't make it work on my Kindle Fire HD.  I had to have my cable company help me with my H.B.O.app.
A12LIH1OJZIDKZ B00BGBOK9O 4 1384041600 26 Enjoyed my first try at this.  The level didn't seem to make it more difficult.  So far so good.  Will try,again and maybe share with others
A12LKX4QGWJ50T B00785P2QC 4 1353801600 55 Very slow start to the game unless you wantto spend real money to buy game money and permits. The review this game on several media's as goals is very silly. The game is in day 2 and my city is coming along though so far so good. But wish you didn't have to buy progress.
A12LKX4QGWJ50T B00B2V66VS 4 1359244800 48 This is a pretty cool game over Temple Run the original.  Like the improved game path (zip lines).  Just played it for a few hours now, so I can't say for certain that the entire game is great.  But it is a little better then 1 and Brave.
A12LKX4QGWJ50T B009UX2YAC 5 1360627200 65 This game is just like Temple Run games, but with a kid twist to it.  My two kids just love it and play every day.  I think is a cute game and I play it every once in awhile just to spend some time with my kids.  They tell me what to do just to make some money to buy upgrades.  We just love it.
A12LN1UTGCPU4R B004VA3X7M 5 1360195200 30 If they delivered any faster, my package would hit the front door before I put in the order.  The post office dosen't even carry a letter across town as fast.
A12LN1UTGCPU4R B00D2K40WY 4 1374883200 20 If its about fashion, my granddaughters love it.  They spent a lot of time with this one. Would buy again.
A12LN1UTGCPU4R B00B63HT8Q 4 1391904000 22 Sometimes my kindle dosen't like radar and locks up.  This one works but dosen't forcast. Can't beat the price so who's complaining
A12LN1UTGCPU4R B004GMT14Y 3 1371168000 20 It's ok for the price and nice to have on my kindle but it is a little awkward to use.
A12LN1UTGCPU4R B0073G5PU4 5 1360281600 23 You can write in this with your finger on your kindle.  I have kept this and occasionally use it. It is fun anyway.
A12LN1UTGCPU4R B008AZGWYK 4 1360886400 21 I really like to standard version better.  Probably takes up room on my kindle unnecessarily.  I don't recommend it to friends
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B00AK0X5VQ 5 1367712000 77 I love this game more than any on my kindle! I only have this game because it was free a while back, and I figured why not? I have since fallen in love with the peaceful urgency this game presents. It is great to do a few levels before bed to unwind and slow down my mind enough to relax :D I highly recommend this game, even at full price, it's worth it in so many levels!
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B004H6WTJI 5 1357430400 130 I have been using MFP for almost 2 years now and have yet to be disappointed! The only time it doesn't know a food is if it's the obscure brand that my local grocery store sells! It has helped me lose 30 lbs in 3 months and I am still steadily losing! I will recommend pairing it with Drs advice, bc he put me on 1500 calories a day, whereas the app tells me I can have 1750, but nonetheless, This app has literally saved my life! I recommend it to everyone I know and have even managed to get 5 or 6 people on it with me so I have a great support system :D I hope this helps someone change their life like it has done for me!
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B0099WWKTO 5 1356480000 25 This game is so much fun! I love being able to play with her whenever I want. It's so relaxing :D I Will highly recommend!
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B008CPZNL6 2 1357344000 85 Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this app! But i finally downloaded a data manager and found out that i was using 40 MB PER SESSION! We aren't talking sitting on it for 2 hours either...like...20 minutes. Being someone who only get 5GB a month, this is unacceptable, I hope that I can figure out a way to bring this down because I LOVE being able to see all of my news in one app, but I just can't stomach this much data use :(
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B008B88LEU 5 1356998400 38 I can't rave enough about this game! Buying the unlimited turns is most definitely worth it! The original map is fun, but nowhere near as Bear Attack!!! I will definitely be recommending this game with the highest praises!
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B00AAX68HG 4 1358640000 44 OveralI I really enjoy this game! Love the art style and quirky blobs of pudding. I am glad that I got the free edition instead of paying for the HD version. Great concept butvI am still waiting for About A Blob to come out!
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B00BFUUMO8 2 1362355200 50 I have tried numerous times to get this to connect to My facebook, but it won't. Even when I go to the facebook page to start it, it says the game isn't available for My device...please fix this! I am dying to play this game with the ability to save!
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B004UBH4S6 5 1356739200 20 i thought this app was enjoyable enough, not very detailed our extensive, but just fine for a quick horoscope check
A12LNDQN72C0R3 B0055ILRN6 5 1357430400 96 If it weren't for this app I would have gone WAY over my data limit! It works exactly as advertised and is incredibly simple to use! It really did save my skin! We only get 5GB of data a month and something I was using was eating it like a hog on slop, but this AMAZING app showed me exactly which apps were using the most data and how much they were using, in bar graph, pie chart, or numeric format :D Needless to say, I don't know how I ever survived without it! Highly recommend!!!
A12LP0CSD02SLM B008XG1X18 5 1359331200 34 I am addicted to pinterest. I don't believe there is a day that goes buy that I am not on it. There is so much neat stuff to find and see and the site.
A12LP0CSD02SLM B0064X7FVE 5 1359331200 21 I thought this was handy so I could check the weather on the kindle when I was not near a computer.
A12LP0CSD02SLM B0064TVQ5E 5 1359331200 25 I loved this game on the computer and when I seen this app I was so excited. It is a game that racks your brain.
A12LPRJGRTUX4H B009EEFTMC 4 1361145600 20 I rated this 4 stars because it does provide fun and challenging oneself. It's quick and easy to play with.
A12LPRJGRTUX4H B00JBNS6KS 5 1398470400 19 This is so challenging love itIts addictive you will have tons of fun hours and hours you can't stop
A12LPRJGRTUX4H B007ZGO7EM 4 1363737600 33 Love this calculator the numbers are big and easy to see. Used it already several times. For those like me that need the numbers to be big this is the calculator for you.
A12LPRJGRTUX4H B009T8XBBO 4 1372377600 45 I really like this game. It is fun and strategic in nature. I just love building my castle. The little men that run around gathering the things are too cute. You will have lots and lots of fun playing this game. I recommend this game.
A12LPRJGRTUX4H B009RLG7RI 5 1363737600 97 My husband told me about this game and found it challenging and exciting. Building the villages was just so cool. Love the little people each time you planted a tree or flowers they would cheer for joy and little hearts would appear. I enjoyed the different strengths that the hero's had. My only disappointment was when I made it to the end and all my villages were completed.  I plan to restart it again it was that much fun and for at least 30 to an hour I was transformed to another place.  I highly recommend it.
A12LS5ZKQ71YM1 B0067Q42BY 5 1329609600 31 i played the free version over and over, then today it's free and i have not stopped playing, just long enough to write this.  i would get it forsure. kindle fire
A12LS5ZKQ71YM1 B007PTJOV0 5 1334102400 25 its very cute and i love it!!!!  i only stopped playing to write my review.  so i love the game its kinda like mario brothers!
A12LS5ZKQ71YM1 B006RA13BW 4 1333411200 23 it is a cute game.  the graphics are super friggin awesome.  i am trying to get my friends and family to download it.
A12LT4BI3KZTNM B00A4KVFLY 5 1361836800 23 This game is great,You play live people and can connect and play friends through Facebook. I really like it and so will you!
A12LUFY3M72TQB B0064DBE9I 3 1385769600 33 This is a fun app to tinker around with and to let the grandkids play a tune or two. I used it frequently when i first got it but hardly use it now.
A12LUFY3M72TQB B005ZFOOE8 5 1385769600 38 This is a good app for your mobile phone. You can get local radio stations as well as distant stations and listen to all kinds of music, sports talk, or political talk shows. I use it almost everyday.
A12LUFY3M72TQB B004Q3CJQ0 5 1385769600 45 This is a good little gadget i use quite frequently. When I walk the dog at night I use the flashing yellow light mode to be more visible to approaching cars. I also use the flash light for whatever task you would use a flashlight.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00BW08XRO 2 1372204800 24 Not for me but it looked great on a 10.5 tablet and the game play was fairly easy.  Very repetitive with few game options.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00BTL5YMI 2 1372204800 33 I love slot games and was excited when I saw this one listed.  It looks great, downloaded quickly but the game has so much going on it is hard to really enjoy it.
A12LVK3RI392MU B0055S348W 2 1399248000 37 I downloaded this app to be able to print to my Canon blue tooth printer from my phone and tablet.  It downloaded easily enough but I was never able to connect to the printer for either device.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00B5KHZA2 1 1372204800 29 I love hidden object games but this one was a disappointment.  Far to much story and not enough actual game play.  I deleted in not long after downloading it.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00846F1YW 3 1368662400 33 I love hidden object games but this one was boring.  It took a long time to get to the actual game play.  It did run and look really good on my ASUS tablet.
A12LVK3RI392MU B005CKNPAK 3 1368662400 25 Download and looked great on my ASUS tablet.  Game play was boring and uninteresting.  I suppose it is personal preference, not the game for me.
A12LVK3RI392MU B007PT3QOQ 1 1372204800 21 Far to much story and not enough game play.  I was expecting more from this, extremely disappointed.  Deleted soon after download.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00B2V66VS 5 1368662400 21 A entertaining and fun game, works and plays well on my ASUS tablet.  Not that much different from the first version.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00ANH526W 2 1400371200 21 To many directions and not enough game play. I want to escape when I play a game, this one take effort.
A12LVK3RI392MU B0085N9I84 3 1368662400 29 It downloaded and ran well on my ASUS tablet but I was not impressed with the game play.  I like simpler games that don't take a lot of thought.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00C1PKO4O 5 1398816000 33 I love all of the Flo games, this one is a lot of fun.  It has great puzzles and in game, games.  If you like time management games, this one is a must.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00AKKTDJY 5 1372204800 39 One of my favorite PC games.  I was excited yet skeptical when downloading the android/tablet version.  Was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed playing the game.  It is worth the download.  The in game adverting to download other games in annoying.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00CEBO09A 1 1372204800 29 Not my cup of tea.  Looked great, downloaded quickly but the game play was boring and somewhat confusing.  I don't like games that require a great deal of thought.
A12LVK3RI392MU B008D2QRAO 5 1368662400 29 I love this game.  The hourly bonus allow you to safe up your money for one big play or to play every hour.  Work great on my ASUS tablet.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00A4KVFLY 5 1364342400 21 Easy yet fun :-) only complaint is the server does not always connect. Overall it is fun and entertaining family fun.
A12LVK3RI392MU B009PSV1HE 5 1398816000 30 Love this games! Another great Flo game, time management at its best.  Its not fancy but it is fun and a great way to lose yourself for a few minutes.
A12LVK3RI392MU B004XNGKBS 2 1399248000 39 I downloaded this for my tablet.  In theory I thought it would be a good tool to replace pen and paper in meetings.  It was difficult for me to write on even using my stylus.  I deleted the app.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00A11AN6O 5 1368662400 21 My husband introduced this to me and I love it.  I have not used even a portion of the available space.
A12LVK3RI392MU B004DLPXAO 4 1372204800 26 Good application with a quick download and frequent updates.  I tend to use this app more than Google read due to the selection of downloadable material.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00CC59H8W 3 1372204800 26 It was fun for a few minutes.  Very repetitive with few game options.  Looks amazing on a 10.5 tablet and downloaded fast but not for me.
A12LVK3RI392MU B004FRX0MY 4 1399248000 28 It is easy to use and gives you access to your music as soon as you download it.  I use it on my smart phone and my tablet.
A12LVK3RI392MU B008RA3X5E 2 1399248000 26 I had high hopes for this app to replace my phones alarm feature.  It was confusing to use and set up and I finally gave up.
A12LVK3RI392MU B004EFYZ1C 2 1399248000 20 An impulse download and a huge waste of time.  It was difficult to use and I deleted is soon after.
A12LVK3RI392MU B00AK2RHR2 5 1368662400 20 I love the cooking dash games they are so addictive.  It downloaded quickly and looks great on my ASUS tablet.
A12LVK3RI392MU B0052UZIFA 5 1372204800 30 My all time favorite PC game.  I was very excited to download to my android tablet.  I was not disappointed, great game place and hours of fun.  Worth your time!!
A12LW3G3OMDA0L B00AKL1XPU 5 1370131200 24 This game is fun I play it all the time . I wish they would make the crossbreeds cheaper so I could make more
A12LW3G3OMDA0L B00B2V66VS 5 1360972800 21 This game is so awesome I play it all the time I wish it came with the kindle I love it
A12LW3G3OMDA0L B0094BB4TW 5 1378080000 25 I like Facebook so much bc i can talk to all my friends any time i want so this is now my favorite app ever
A12LW3G3OMDA0L B00GZP30G0 1 1401148800 25 This app was fun but I've read reviews about freezing and it already happened to me twice!! I can't believe I paid $3.99 for this
A12LXOXFJWCMFH B006MK63XK 5 1335052800 27 love this app! its my favorite app on amazon. play it every day is what everyone should do with this app. its what i do with it.
A12LXOXFJWCMFH B006OC2ANS 1 1332028800 27 I got this app for my kindle, it was fun and I enjoyed it, but it wont work after tut. 5. Don't get this app for kindle!
A12LXOXFJWCMFH B007Z4AKQI 1 1340236800 39 THIS STUPID APP BROKE MY KINDLE FIRE!!! I CANT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET NOW!!!!! AND MY HEADPHONES STARTED TO WONK OUT EVER SINCE I GOT THIS APP!!! THANKS A CRAP TON GLU MOBILE INC. YOU REEEAAALLY MADE MY DAY!!!
A12M04SMQRUJMM B006OCM13M 5 1400284800 121 I love this game. It is, like the title says, the best game ever! You can make a storm id to visit other people's bakery, and make friends. You can post messages on their walls, and have people post on yours! You gain star rating by tipping the other bakeries, and can also gift you friends, or neighbors. I love to interact with the other different players all over the world! The only few regrets I have is that the prices go higher as you go on, you can't have conversations all that well, the fact that I should be a five star rating and I'm not,and food spoiling. There are some others, but over all, this game is the best!
A12M04SMQRUJMM B00J68TF6W 4 1400371200 77 Well, this game is fun, works great on my kindle fire, and is addicting and time wasting. When you sit down and try to play,"just a little," you might be playing for hours. I find it very hard to put down. It's frustrating, fun, and, yet again, frustrating. I have taken away one point because it distracted me from my stuff, but other than that, it is a good game, while your waiting for something, to play.
A12M04SMQRUJMM B00J05XSGY 1 1402790400 69 This app sucks. I hate it! It doesn't work nearly as well as my other one! (I got this one so I could see how it works) How does it not work well? It has horrible reactions! So slow! I swipe my finger left, and then ten seconds later, it goes slowly left. Don't get this app! Get the normal 2048! If you get this one, you'll regret it!
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00FR84CB8 1 1382313600 42 This game has too many gliches. I have had to restart my kindle many times after or before using this game. I recommend not to get this game unless you want your device to not work or have a lot of gliches
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00G5LQ5MU 3 1384560000 23 this game tests your mind to see if you can do something if you challenges then you are going to like this game.
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00EQB80HE 5 1378857600 21 I love this game it is additive I can't stop playing it. I recommend this game for people who like bongo.
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00CRLSN4U 4 1375920000 30 I really enjoy this it is very entertaining this is the best game that ive had on my tablet yet. I love it I recommend this game for guessing lover.
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00D0KRGYU 1 1383782400 28 this game is terrible me and my nephew were watching this and now he can't sleep. Don't buy this game unless you want your kids to not sleep.
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00CDBLC8S 4 1383350400 27 This game causes you to think a lot. It's a lot of fun, if you like games that challenge your brain this is the game for you.
A12M60UCVPIMZ7 B00DJFIMW6 4 1375574400 22 This game is an amazing game I let my nephews play and it is so entertaining for them I recommend this app.
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B007NZRKF8 2 1342310400 53 There I was trying to find an audio book I saved to my phone..so I was looking in the sd card folder...and wow there were all these thumbnails of the cards and background for this app..it appears that every time I played 100s of thumbnails were generated.. I only played 4 times :(
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B006IY163C 2 1324771200 22 Free but not really--well 4 are free but mostly it's an advert for the other 5 games---kinda of a waste of time
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B006RA13BW 3 1333411200 28 Ok you have to hit home to get out of it...but it's kind of fun even for adults...especially if you need a time killer that's not very involved
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B004SYP5WC 3 1331510400 43 For those of you who are so much smarter than the average human...it must be nice to never forget...just wait..one day you too might be juggling two sets of household bills then things can get dicy....everybody eventually forgets at least one bill once
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B007ROSXRO 5 1362096000 22 Needs more sound selections..you can never have enough.  I think the ability to mix the sounds and record is a great benefit.
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B00529IOXO 3 1335657600 61 This was a nice little app till the update abt a month ago when my text number changed. Since I keep the texting mostly for ppl to text me, i didn't realize my number changed because i got no notice.  The app sends me all sorts of crap texts but it couldn't let me know my number had changed.  Very disappointing
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B006YVGOA4 5 1337040000 23 I have little piano pro and this beats it hands down. You can do so much more with keychord..including recording what you play.
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B0067R0APK 3 1364083200 39 I loved this app b4 this last update. I find the hourly forecast hard to read now ( suddenly the Weather Channel free app is easier to use). It is nice to fluidly look at move than one location
A12M8IH4UUGN6G B004T68X4Q 5 1326240000 21 Didn't have any problems with this on my ATRIX 2 except I couldn't stop playing it--and the birds are so cute
A12MC4DHHH4UAZ B004HE5TAG 5 1374278400 25 This game is a lot of fun and so easy to play. I have learner a lot about the game. I'm ready for Vegas baby!!!
A12MC4DHHH4UAZ B00529IOXO 5 1369180800 45 I have tried several other texting apps but Textplus has been the easiest to set up and use. The other person does not have to sign up for service like the other ones make you do. It could not have been easier to start using!
A12MC4DHHH4UAZ B00AVGGYNA 5 1363305600 21 This game is great! My kids are always asking to play. I think it helps them think faster!!! Great family entertainment!
A12MC4DHHH4UAZ B009C7ZQM4 5 1387324800 30 This app does exactly what it says it does. My Kindle Fire would be useless without being able to clean it up from time to time. Really makes things easier!
A12MC4DHHH4UAZ B00ELV0WF2 5 1394755200 21 I enjoy playing. It is very easy and goes real quick. I seem to play this game the most right now!
A12MF1KAO3X1JZ B00BS3UFCQ 5 1366848000 21 This app is a great way to test how well your memory is. I simple love this app. It's very entertaining.
A12MF1KAO3X1JZ B009KS4XRO 5 1373500800 22 I love to play this game except I wish we could get credits more often. But I'm so addicted to this game!!!
A12MF1KAO3X1JZ B00CRLSN4U 5 1379808000 21 This is a great app for adults and kids. Very addicting but fun. Just wish that hints didn't cost so much.
A12MIHSH7XDY7S B006OOHYIC 5 1346976000 23 It actually keeps me busy. Nice mental challenge. I barley started the game but but the first 3 levels were fun to play.
A12MIHSH7XDY7S B007V4X5MS 5 1337644800 43 This app is great for kids. I like the other app this company makes called color and drawing. They ask to play it all the time and this app is just as great. Good way for them to learn their ABC as well..
A12MIHSH7XDY7S B004QJGPNM 5 1301961600 27 this game is actually not bad at all..dope graphics and pretty cool to battle other people. lol and I got it for free with amazon app store
A12MIHSH7XDY7S B004DPC5Y2 5 1323388800 32 great app for kids. my niece who is 3 learned her color with this and the two year old is watching and learning what she does...overall great game wish there was more
A12MIHSH7XDY7S B004FRX0MY 5 1301616000 25 Cloud uploading is pretty sick..buy an album and they give you 20 gb for year for free its like Pandora but of your own music
A12MQ0B7LDX44U B0093QQCGI 1 1391385600 28 Works for subscribers to scores of cable systems (like &quot;VolcanoVision&quot;!), but not for Time Warner Cable. Looks like a good app if you're not a victim of TWC...
A12MQ0B7LDX44U B008DYK0I2 4 1359072000 132 I'm surprised and pleased that this live TV app works on my Fire HD, since the unavailability of Flash Player precludes most live TV on my device. But this one works fine; I have Time Warner Cable (which may or may not be a factor). I actually get more ESPN channels on my Fire HD than on my non-premium TWC cable television. This app has a nice menu which permits searching shows by sport or by ESPN channel, including schedules of future telecasts and video replays of recent-past telecasts. I took one star off my rating because the picture quality can vary widely from from one video replay to the next: the BCS football championship replay was pretty muddy, for example-- but picture quality on the live shows is apparently consistently good.
A12MRS3AJVVAGT B0064X7B4A 1 1335484800 47 I used to play this game with about 10 friends when suddenly everyone stopped playing. found out they all did the update and it rendered their game unplayable. this used to be an awesome game on my kindle firebut ive uninstalled it since it no longer runs.
A12MRS3AJVVAGT B005ZXWMUS 2 1325635200 42 I installed this on my fire and it worked the first time I used it but the sound was out of sync and the video very choppy. I uninstalled to try again and now it wont even install.  What a shame too.
A12MUCYXT1P2D8 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1386460800 24 It's a great game not too hard but doesn't definitely makes u use ur head. I just started playing it but love it already
A12MUCYXT1P2D8 B00FPH8L40 5 1392681600 20 Love this app it exercises ur brain. Plus free coins. I would recommend it to every one that I know
A12MUCYXT1P2D8 B00G357N92 5 1393027200 21 I like how you can cook and serve different varieties of people. Plus free 500 bucks for upgrades for in game
A12MV2TCVXXRPU B00E4MCCF6 4 1392336000 21 fun and works well. would like more options for puzzles or to generate new puzzles with my own pictures or photos
A12MV2TCVXXRPU B007FTZDN8 5 1395360000 116 It is not hard to find content on the internet that is just plain junk or misleading, many web sites show little integrity for it's inventor, TED talks however shows its value and opportunity to hear from  those who are the movers, shakers, inventors, makers, and influential thinkers. Thumbs up that through this project you can hear just about any kind of speaker, subject or interest that you can imagine and whether you agree with them or not It is a way to learn and stay informed and is available at your whim or convenience.  We would rarely have the privilege otherwise to experience these leaders and experts in their own words.  Great app and free!!!
A12MV2TCVXXRPU B008UXIDYE 4 1398038400 20 very well put together information and search option, I found that the translations a big help in understanding scripture refrences
A12MVB5OOHYYBQ B005ZXWMUS 5 1391817600 23 Always fun to use and enjoy with the family. Lots of great value. Constantly updated. A must have for shows. We Love it!!
A12MVB5OOHYYBQ B00BEPVAV8 5 1362873600 23 I like playing this game with my daddy. My mommy found it for me. My sister watches us play. My dog is awesome!!
A12MVB5OOHYYBQ B00BS3UFCQ 5 1369353600 21 Well done app. Fun to play on the road. It really gets the movie Trivia moving. Fun to compete with others.
A12MX9I47SO4BD B00CD3L8JY 5 1403222400 48 I downloaded this for my 22 month old grand daughter.  She loved it.  It's a fairly simple puzzle app where you click and drag the pieces to &#34;fit&#34; into the outline.  There are animals, vehicles, and even popsicles.  She especially likes the flower puzzles.  Good app for toddlers.
A12MX9I47SO4BD B00EEDJHXA 5 1377129600 43 My 15 year old told me about this game.  I am totally hooked.  You have to plan out your moves in order to complete each level.  It's lots of fun and it can keep you busy for hours!  I highly recommend this game.
A12MX9I47SO4BD B00BGBZGEW 2 1363392000 28 I bought the 99 cent version to get the hints.  I had no idea there were only a few levels and then it started back at the beginning.
A12N8NVXAO5XXJ B007DKC922 5 1332633600 27 ive been looking for a game like this so I can splatter bugs and this game I have bombs to splatter the bugs with bring it bugs:)
A12N8NVXAO5XXJ B004TP2E7O 5 1328659200 24 I always seeing this but never download but know I cant stop playing it all the deferent world's upgrades all the armor funny clothes
A12N8NVXAO5XXJ B008LG021M 5 1356652800 36 if u love guns and cars this is ur game freaking great game ppl I couldn't believe it was free wen u get the chance to download and play ur going to be in love ......
A12N8NVXAO5XXJ B006OC2ANS 5 1330300800 28 I like this game its pretty good its a little hard to get the stuff for guy and u have to pay for everything but its all good
A12N9SH7OVMCR5 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392336000 24 It is fun and is like flappy birds but less aggravating. It is easier then flappy birds I just started and already got 10.
A12N9SH7OVMCR5 B00CKW6FVE 5 1395360000 20 Fun fast paced enjoyable to play everyday .it is a challenging variety game of the original Tetris game ...Very addictive
A12N9SH7OVMCR5 B008Y7SMQU 5 1363132800 25 This was the funniest game in the world. Some of the logo I never saw before but sometimes there are easy ones and hard ones.
A12NC5IM9OM4HS B00DEG4Z1W 3 1373587200 26 this is children's awesome paly with it and I hsve fun with it if I get bored with it and once awhile playing for cutting hairs!
A12NC7J2QMR1ZU B00AREIAI8 5 1360886400 30 This is a great virtual game....keeps me coming back to make sure my horse is well! Great to help give someone an idea of what it takes to keep horses.
A12NC7J2QMR1ZU B00F0U8SAO 5 1385164800 33 Liked the thought provoking puzzles! Scenes were well done and the app ran smoothly on my kindle.  I would highly recommend this game for those who like adventure...can't wait to start Drawn 2.
A12NC7J2QMR1ZU B00DRHY8EW 5 1386374400 26 Great game! Puzzles are thought provoking and hidden objects not so easy to find.  Program ran smoothly no glitches! Also like having strategy guide for reference!
A12NC7J2QMR1ZU B00ENTE4XS 5 1388620800 32 Love this game!  Big Fish does a great job on developing challenging, thought provoking games...very well done!  Scenes are very well illustrated.  It is hard for me to put the game down!
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B008Y7SMQU 5 1348185600 26 good game, some are very challenging. takes up a lot of time and is a good distraction when ur on the road. thanks for this guys
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B008FRA5LY 4 1342137600 75 I played this game on my friend's ipad and I liked it. I just downloaded it on my kindle fire and its ok so far, but any time I try to hit the logo button at the top, it doesn't do anything..so I'm jus stuck there. The back button at the bottom takes me back, but I don't get a tick on the ones I answered. not sure, but hopefully restarting my kindle fixes it.
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B006OOHVVC 5 1348012800 28 It's nice and challenging always. Sometimes its hard to figure out simple words lol..or sometimes it seems like its one word, but its really another. Love it :)
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B00BS3UFCQ 3 1369180800 33 it is kinda hard to see some of the images and they are in a cartoon like form,  so that makes it harder to guess. there are no movie clips, faces or anything.
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B00CTQ6SIG 1 1373155200 22 downloaded it and it doesn't open. deleted it and reinstalled it, same thing. not worth the time and space. don't even bother
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B0088QGB7Y 5 1351900800 85 I'm not sure what everyone is talking about. my game doesn't crash like they say. sometimes (but very rare), I have to force close it, but when I open the game again right after, it world smoothly. I don't buy smurfberries as I'm not one to purchase things on games..but u get 1 berry every time u level up. I barely use mine. I have been playing for months and it keeps mme occupied. overall I think its a very fun and cute game :)
A12NCDQ9GWV8TC B005AJ6ISO 5 1348185600 24 Great read each day. Its a timely reminder, especially in down times. What a blessing. May God bless all those who've worked on this.
A12NCG1YY07LMN B0067VKQLE 5 1374883200 56 Wonderful graphics, sound design and humor in this tower-defense type game. One of my favorites for killing time. No outside money needed, quick-loading, great variety of levels, just challenging enough not to be boring but it's not brain surgery, either - perfect for when I just want to veg out. Fun for kids who can read.
A12NCG1YY07LMN B008JHQXK2 3 1374883200 50 It took a little effort for my four year old babysitting charge to learn the drag and drop function, but once he got past the frustration of that,he enjoyed it up to a point. He still prefers the color and action of  &#34;Fruit Ninja&#34; which is hard to compete with.
A12NCG1YY07LMN B00CAM8YL8 1 1398297600 182 &quot;Next time you're feeling hungry, give yourself permission to go into supermarket to get a healthy snack like some celery or fruit or dairy instead ... &quot; Really? Dairy as in delicious CHEESE? This hypnotic suggestion is deep into the middle of the program. Not a direct quote, but this program really did hurt my diet, it did not help.  Fortunately around the seventh listen my brain bolted awake and said HEY MAN, BACK OFF with your sketch nutrition advice! I am very hypnotically-susceptible, and enjoy some of the other hypnosis programs in this series, and really wanted a weight-loss one to shed an extra 10 pounds acquired from Christmas that has persisted in spite of working out regularly. I feel stupid now for not forcing myself to stay awake and conscious through this first before downloading it into my brain. This one had me back to impulsively buying cream cheese for the celery in no time - and cheddar, and brie and mozzarella and bleu cheese. Geesh - back to square one with that stupid little detail. I have to laugh.
A12NCG1YY07LMN B00632HWOG 1 1400457600 100 ...I still don't trust it to always send all the emails I've composed, which is kind of basic as far as an email app goes, but I just make sure I go online and do it that way when it's an important matter. Sometimes the screen just freezes. Over all, the experience is occasionally frustrating. I prefer not to use my Kindle Fire for email in general, but often have no choice. I remain hopeful that the developers will continue to work on things. Until then, Kindle remains great for games and reading but is not great things like email.
A12NH5JRJ4GWY8 B006E51AZY 4 1381190400 37 This game is really fun and don't worry boys, the butterfly on the front has nothing to do with the game; I found myself playing this game over and over again so you should definetly get it
A12NH5JRJ4GWY8 B004N2NWQ0 5 1371254400 20 this game teaches youbasic skills for reading and solving conflicts and math problems as fast as possible plusnits totally addicting!!
A12NH5JRJ4GWY8 B00CZY1ZV2 2 1371427200 67 its not all that great. you clean the guys teeth but there aren't that many teeth options. Also, you put stickers and change the Color of his teeth at the end?? seems odd. I don't know if that's supposed to be braces or something but they should have a braces option. it is probably really run for younger kids but its not amusing me for very long.
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B008NCUFYS 4 1359072000 63 So simple I can't put it down! Wish there was a way to actually get rid of the slime for longer than 3 minutes at a time and that you'd get double prizes (or SOMETHING) for landing 2 balls in the same cup. Tilt features might be nice, too, to influence balls already in play, but that could get complicated fast. LOVE IT!
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B00DSM7J2E 2 1401753600 396 This was a strike out for an otherwise amazing developer. There were enough five-star reviews I chose to ignore the negatives. DON'T.The driving is a joke, which was why I bought it to begin with. The truck moves in a straight line. There's no turning the wheel, no navigation options, no route to follow. This is the only section really geared for 2-year-olds. Definitely boring for older children, and my son will even walk away from it while the truck is moving along the road.Building the cupcakes requires following directions but no creativity. Charging the customer for the cupcakes requires following directions but no actual counting or number recognition. I thought he would need to count out the correct number of coins, but the ladybug closes its wings after the correct amount. Also, the screen shows the price and the number buttons blink after a set time without the correct choice being made. This section is enjoyable but not educational for the younger group, and I don't see it holding the attention of an older child.The ice cream slingshot is WAY too advanced for my techno-happy 2.5-year-old. The mouse is constantly stealing his ice cream scoop and telling him he picked the wrong flavor when he just didn't get it to the sling without lifting his finger or going out of the allowed zone. I would like an option (possibly in settings) that would allow him to load the sling and tap the animal on the screen to send it to. He may be the only child in America deprived of angry birds, but he cannot figure out the slingshot yet.The age range in this app is actually a drawback for me since my son enjoys the rewards for delivering all of the ice cream scoops correctly but cannot perform the required task to get there. This means that I deal with a tantrum as my son tries to get me to play the game for him that escalates when I exit the app after being unable to get him to play a different section. Other 22L apps (such as their sight words game) have age range options and the parent can lock out certain aspects of the game that are too advanced for the child. This game needs that.I've had to block it out of his lock app too many times. Uninstalled from my kindle.
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B008Y212PI 4 1381363200 196 This game is addicting and increasingly challenging. Best game of its type that I've played!Hints don't seem to help much since the puzzles I've used them on have large open areas, but they do occasionally help. Deselect button is a big plus!However, I've had issues with the user interface. Even on my 7&quot; Kindle Fire, the paint and break buttons are too close together, and I end up hitting the wrong one at least once very few puzzles, despite increasing how careful I am. I'd love an option to put them on opposite sides of the screen, especially with the playing field being so easy to center.I've tried playing on my LG Spectrum II, but that only works well for 5x5 and acceptably for 10x10. 15x15 makes each block too small for my fingers to be very accurate. I have to be incredibly deliberate painting and breaking on this smaller screen as well.Recently pleasantly surprised to discover additional puzzle pages. I've been playing a little while now and had only found 3 pages. All of these puzzles must be completed before the others are accessible. No teasing here with pages you can see but not access!
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B007IIZVLA 1 1360540800 37 This showed an instruction screen saying to select this program as default, and when I hit select, the program closed and took me back to my home screen. Good idea if you can get it to work!
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B00HRMNKWE 2 1398988800 161 I enjoy 7 Little Words but don't enjoy constantly having to purchase new games. Thought this would be a good alternative, but the fifth level I played is not solvable. I have 2 words left, ranch and feather. I even used hints to confirm this. However, all of my letters are in groups of 2. Can't make an odd number of letters with even numbered clues.Other than that, I feel the game is overall clunky.There should be a button when I finish a level to take me to the next level. Instead, I have to return to the level screen and pick one.I would REALLY love an option to change the color palette to something with less contrast, as well.This is only an annoyance, but it'd be nice if there was more congruity between between the clues and answers. Who thinks &quot;collar&quot; when given the word &quot;flea&quot;?Has potential for five stars, but bad code making levels unsolvable is a deal breaker.
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B0087EACJK 2 1364860800 123 This game wants each level completed within a specific time frame, but it doesn't show a clock or any indication of what that time frame is until the second time through the level. The runner is sluggish to respond (and that is not the fault of my device), so even when I know exactly how to complete the level, I have trouble staying within the 'time to beat'. The tiles must be completely in place to zoom back in, but they don't always go there on the first (or second) swipe. Several times, I zoomed out while trying to get the runner to move. Multiple quick view changes with small movements required in some levels feel tedious. Glad I didn't pay for it!
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B00BOUROR2 2 1380412800 122 I read the reviews and thought, &quot;The cards can't be THAT tiny, right?&quot; Wrong! I could barely see value, let alone suit, and I have very good eyes. I only tried Klondike style and didn't even win that - but it looked like it would be winnable had I been checking suits.But wait! There's more! There is no drop magnet in this game. This means that you have to get a tiny card very incredibly close to where it needs to be for it to drop there. Kings have to be centered in the foundation box, aces need to be centered in their boxes, etc. Quite difficult when my fingertip is 3x the size of the card I'm moving!Sorry, devs - uninstalled...
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B007TXN4TK 3 1359849600 105 I found this very difficult to follow because I couldn't judge when 2 notes on opposite sides of the screen should be played in relation to each other. Slower tempos are actually not helpful because the melodies are more difficult to follow. I also had trouble hitting the right keys as the keyboard rolled over to accommodate a higher or lower section - or really anytime since the keys are smaller than my fingers. Kept hitting adjacent keys. Feel like it would be easier on a larger screen that might not need to roll and/or could have larger keys (I have a 7&quot; Kindle fire).
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B0087SGWI6 1 1357776000 66 Thought this app was stand-alone mind games, but it just linked me to lumosity and wanted me to set up a trial account - which is only good for 3 days before it will auto-subscribe and charge my account. Account set up with lumosity is still required, so there's a time gap between installation and actual play, too. READ AS YOU GO &amp; USE WITH CAUTION!
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B009DDKZT6 2 1372809600 200 This app would be great if the rotate function worked correctly. I want to throw my kindle fire across the room playing as it is, though. My touch screen works perfectly in other apps, so I know that isn't the issue. Two-finger touch controls are a great idea, but a backup button would make this a five star game. I've hit the reset button twice since it looks like it should rotate the cube (playing while distracted). I've not had "sticky piece" issues like some other reviewers, though, and just making sure your fingers are in the empty space instead of on the cube when you try to rotate will prevent pieces from coming off unintentionally. I play Cubistry, so I'm used to making sure I don't touch the cube while I rotate it.Otherwise: The puzzles require just enough thought to stay interesting but not make me give up. The expand feature is a nice touch! Very neat game!Edit: After reading reviews that levels would lock when the game was exited, I tried to check on my device, and the game won't open! Tried several times, even. Very glad I got it free, or I'd be very unhappy right now!
A12NIMGZ4LWUU8 B00HBVON72 2 1388880000 46 This app was fun for all of five minutes. I got up to 315 coins, and suddenly the pictures stopped working. The app was asking me to guess the brand without a clue. I tried closing it and resetting memory, and it still isn't working. Boo!
A12NON60XG7OID B004MC8CA2 5 1345420800 27 Easy to bring along, on long trips, at lunch, or for quiet study time,  easy to reference versus or chapters. I am grateful the app is available.
A12NON60XG7OID B006BDHAX0 4 1370476800 30 I really like this version of Mahjong and I am able to play this one many,  many times. There are hours of enjoyment. to be had with Mahjong Delude HD.
A12NVXTNPJR5AR B00E8KLWB4 3 1390176000 25 This is hard to understand the process of. I have 2 object puzzles open and 1 wooden puzzle what does it. Take to open another?
A12NVXTNPJR5AR B00ADPH2YO 4 1360195200 22 fast fun. easy to understand. there are no controls for the sound effects. sometimes they need to be turned down or off.
A12NVXTNPJR5AR B0067Q42BY 4 1333670400 32 it takes my mind off work of anykind. not at all hard to recognize tiles.  when they change between games. cool tile combos and relaxing backgrounds. great time killer waiting for  appointments.
A12NX1X20YI4KR B006QC53WG 5 1344470400 34 This game is addicting. I always loved tri peaks solitaire and finally found a free game of it. I end up playing this for hours until the battery dies or my wife threatens me.
A12NX1X20YI4KR B0067QCC70 5 1337126400 20 Very fun any at times a good challenge. Have enjoyed playing the game to kill time and just for fun.
A12NX1X20YI4KR B007PT3QOQ 5 1337385600 25 the game is just about as fun as the original. brings back a lot of fond memories. minus the bad graphics from the original game.
A12NX1X20YI4KR B0088QGB7Y 5 1339804800 28 this game is fun to play and reminds me of the goodold days of watching thecartoon when I was little. the mini games are kind of addicting too.
A12NY87WXEW6H3 B00D0VZLVE 5 1376784000 35 this game is very fun and it makes you think. some puzzles are hard to figure out but when you do you wonder why it took you so long. I am having fun with it.
A12NY87WXEW6H3 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1384819200 29 this game is very fun and exciting. starts out easy but gets a little harder. cant wait to play more. I like puzzle games so this one is perfect.
A12NZH66UYUNFP B007NZV2HK 1 1369612800 36 If it didn't keep crashing, didn't have so many ads, didn't have defective puzzles, didn't have made up words, didn't load upside down, &amp; blah, blah, blah. I hope to find a better one. Any suggestions?
A12NZH66UYUNFP B00HY9UK28 4 1399075200 24 My granddaughter loves to play this! It has a good variety of songs and lots of levels. I recommend this game to music lovers!!
A12NZH66UYUNFP B00COVCV50 5 1371600000 46 This game is fun and challenging at the same time! It makes you use your brain to try and figure out what the four pictures have in common. I enjoy playing this game and you will too! Go ahead, download it. You will only have fun!!!
A12O0R6RFGEAGU B008G0HTUU 5 1343692800 20 Extremely fun and amazing. I'm not sure how to spend my remaining words so I will write this instead. Yay
A12O0R6RFGEAGU B006OC2ANS 5 1332374400 22 it is really fun. it has good combat with upgrades. I Love it. I would personally spend about 5 bucks for it.
A12O1IA0C63WD B00BEPVAV8 4 1365811200 40 I only just started playing, but so far, I really like it. It has the feel of a real console game with a sort of temple run in a go cart kind of thing. And it's free, so that's nice.
A12O1IA0C63WD B00CWY76CC 4 1373587200 53 I liked this game a lot more than other games like it. It was challenging, but just when I was about give up, I found the answer. The only thing I would change about it is that it would be nice to have some kind of hint option. Can't wait for more levels!
A12O1IA0C63WD B00AZL3PBK 3 1365811200 118 I had the first Lep's World on my phone, and loved it. I got a kindle fire recently, so I got the second game. It's a much larger game, and the fun game I wanted, but at times, the directional controls won't respond and the most irritating problem is that when the checkpoint is on or near a ledge, it restarts you in mid air next to the ledge and you have to pray that you can double jump fast enough to get you to land. These two problems combined are extremely frustrating. I love this game! Please fix it!! Will gladly give it give stars when these issues are resolved, but for now it gets a three.
A12O1IA0C63WD B00ATDOVNK 4 1370304000 49 I love each hidden object game from this company so far. The only thing I would change is to make it longer. Seems like I beat them in two short sittings. Otherwise, great game! The short time frame is the only thing keeping me from giving it five stars.
A12O2FDRF9557L B008MEM24S 4 1347667200 25 the game it self is very fun but I think they ask to rate it to soon at least wait until after the 1st week
A12O2FDRF9557L B00701L5XS 3 1342569600 27 I like the idea because this could save a life so it can be important but some knots go to fast to see how you tie them
A12O2FDRF9557L B008N8IV2U 3 1344556800 23 I was on legal 30 I go online and when I am back its gone Evan though it is still a fun game.
A12O76D6W3NGT7 B005V1N71W 5 1388966400 20 Easy to use and fun.  Easy to change stations and create customs ones.  Recommend this to all my friends. Thanks
A12O76D6W3NGT7 B00GNIJAEA 5 1388966400 24 I enjoy sharing fun stuff with the guyz, I wish it was more customizable with different things that you can add on to it
A12ODDSMSROMQ5 B00DYY92MG 2 1384300800 21 When you get stuck on one level it's hard to figure it out and I finally just stopped playing all together.
A12ODDSMSROMQ5 B0063IH60K 5 1384300800 21 Play this all the time. I love the variety of choices that you have like multi draw or one-3 card play.
A12ODDSMSROMQ5 B00EBQRSTK 5 1384300800 22 Love this game! Hard to put it down once we start playing. Keeps us entertained for hours. Even our kids like it.
A12ODDSMSROMQ5 B00DBCJLOA 3 1384300800 21 Not a big fan because you don't get very many coins each day and haven't won very much to keep playing.
A12ODDSMSROMQ5 B00FAPF5U0 5 1382572800 25 Love this game, it challenges you to be creative! Once you start playing you won't be able to stop. A must have on every devise.
A12OGQBR7O2KR7 B0097EWK3A 5 1380240000 22 One of the best games I've played. Kept me going the whole way through. Can't wait the sequence. Hope it's as good!
A12OGQBR7O2KR7 B00BJA2VFW 5 1389830400 33 Very good game. I have played it all the way through many times. I am ready for the next one! Try it it, if you like match 3's, you will like this game.
A12OGQBR7O2KR7 B009G9KFQ0 5 1402790400 39 I love having the weatherbug! It is great to open it up at anytime and check the temp and check for any recently updated weather events!!!!!!!! Thank you so much! I have already told many people about this app!
A12OJ40MN3VCUH B0054JZC6E 5 1341792000 32 it is so cool I think that kids 6 and up should really consiter playing this it is so cool I really love it and think that kids will love it to.
A12OJ40MN3VCUH B008CFVG58 5 1343520000 29 I love this game it is so cool and it is a fun filled adventure of cooking serving. it is cool for little kids to I love this game.
A12OJ40MN3VCUH B008H4MVRG 5 1341792000 21 it is a awesome game and I think that kids will love this game it is a really really cool game
A12OJ40MN3VCUH B008UZ00TI 5 1345334400 23 it so cool its like a twist on Angry birds. but in stead of pigs to kill you have to eat rubber Euclid's.
A12OJATGNNA5K9 B006D1ONE4 5 1353283200 28 I love this game . you should get this game if you like puzzles and skip one level than come back to it so I highly recommend it
A12OJATGNNA5K9 B00846GKTW 5 1343952000 34 this game is easy to understand and entertaining if you like fashion play  this game but be careful if you want more money you can earn then for free or pay money for it
A12OMHG68Z5P3U B005J80RTW 5 1380585600 46 Excellent game. Fun for a quick couple of minutes or hours before you know what happen to the time. Great fun playing against friends and strangers from around the world. Bet if you get to the Diamond League, you don't get to stay long. Good luck!
A12OU3A7BVKALW B0071Q75AO 2 1331337600 30 I'm pretty sure this app chooses random emotions and is generally boring, I mean mood rings are more fun than this! trust me don't waste your time on this app.
A12OU3A7BVKALW B00529IOXO 5 1333843200 22 the title says it all. most useful app I have and works great on kindle fire! definitaley a must have for anyone
A12OU3A7BVKALW B007VUA7VO 5 1345075200 31 this great to check your battery and so much more, temp, and the color is changeable this is an amazing. app I recommend this to everybody,  and a must have app!
A12OU3A7BVKALW B004Z9Y3VY 3 1331337600 25 was fun the first time around but is just boring now. is fun to make your friends do but isn't really good for anything else.

I played 4hours at a time, only stopping to recharge my kindle fire when my game stops and says I have to pay 5 stinking bucks to continue!

A12OXT9E9XZ7JG B009HKL4B8 4 1357084800 130 I am 13 and in school. I would have rated this game &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733; but I have a complaint.

THERE ARE TOILETS IN THE HOUSE FOR A REAZON, SIMS.And the &quot;unhappy&quot; Sims cant go to work or other sim's houses. And why cant the toddlers go to preschool? Should'nt they be allowed to do something other than being quarintined in a house with pee puddles FROM THE ADULTS all over? this would have been a great game if the &quot;issues&quot; I described could be fixed.liked my review? where you humored? check out my LOL reviews on apps like butt vader ,plants vs zombies, top girl, and where's my water?

A12P3XMH9TW5RW B0097GVJWQ 5 1371772800 20 I thought it had really good graphics. when I started playing I couldn't stop until I finished the whole game.
A12P3XMH9TW5RW B00AA87JGU 5 1367107200 21 Very entertaining. Cant seem to turn it off. So levels are hard but not undoable. Good game if you like puzzles.
A12P3XMH9TW5RW B00EL71DR2 5 1377734400 20 this was an interesting story line. I had fun playing it and graphic were ok. but overall pretty good game
A12P3XMH9TW5RW B00A77II0U 5 1370217600 20 nice graphics. very fun to play and it was very easy to follow. i couldn't stop playing till I finished.
A12P3XMH9TW5RW B00DRHY8EW 5 1377388800 21 liked the twist on the story line was a little difficult at first but had a lot of fun playing it
A12P45IJPK5A2Q B009UX2YAC 5 1385251200 29 Well my 2 9 year old kids love it and downloaded it to there kindles and its great for when I'm cooking dinner or lunch for all ages !
A12P45IJPK5A2Q B00EW3STPY 4 1380153600 40 My Kids really love this game I have two 5 year old and one 4 year old who all adore this game and develops skill:) I know my 6 month old baby will loves this when he gets older lol
A12P4V52UH5CCU B007PTJOV0 5 1335052800 22 this game is really fun and is just like super mario bros. which i love! its free so why not try it!?
A12P4V52UH5CCU B004Z92T9W 1 1327190400 45 this version of frogger is awful! they buttons to.move the frog are terrible, which makes it very diffiicult to play. you also cant slide right  behind a car because it will kill you! don't waste the $1 on this game, waste it on something else!
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B00824BM76 1 1362873600 23 this app makes no sence and makes it hard to actually make a schedule or pull up what you put in your schedule.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B009UWL580 4 1377993600 35 This game brings back memories when I traveled with my grandmother across the country. I don't travel like that any more but my youngest child loves to play with me and watch the claw drop.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B009P8EMCK 3 1362873600 21 the kids watch occasionally but this doesn't really keep their attention there are such limited options they get more from netflix.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B0087FDS22 3 1359936000 55 It was a cute game and definitely understandable for my 8 year old but any younger and its to much to think about. set up a lot like any other game to &#34;build your own city&#34; however you have limited &#34;energy&#34; and you have to come back later to play more or purchase more energy.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B007ZGO7EM 4 1359936000 47 What more do I have to say hehe. Well if your looking for a scientific calculator this is not the one for you. it is a simple calculator that will not do everything for you so you would actually have to do some work in that equation.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B008Y7SMQU 4 1370908800 23 I thought it was going to be easy for me and I was wrong. But it is very fun. Thanks for the game.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B00ET47USI 5 1403654400 22 I remember this game from my childhood. I enjoyed it then and I still enjoy it. The game is also kindle friendly.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B009HQ9UHC 5 1359936000 40 You don't throw the pigs like in angry birds you help them get to the finish line through an obstacle. you have to build some kind of a go-cart  like thing to get the pigs to the end without crashing.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B006KX3GXO 5 1359936000 40 This app is so much fun My kids decorated pictures of themselves to send to their grandmother who lives on the other side of the country. Also has sharing options to post on facebook or twitter and several other sites.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B0064X7FVE 5 1359936000 39 It gave me weather for my town and that is all I was looking for. It also has several different options to look at such as pollen count around your area. which is helpful for anyone with pollen allergies.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B005ZXWMUS 5 1359936000 29 I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 the picture from netflic is pristine and pleasing to the eyes to watch netflix. (Must have internet connection to watch a movie)
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B008XG1X18 5 1359936000 30 I love Pintrest and this is a pretty easy app to get through it. Even for beginners who are not quite as familiar with the functions of the Kindle Fire.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B009DCOU9S 4 1375574400 59 I like search and puzzle games and they all go by to quick. This game was no exception however I think this game was better than a lot more than I have played.I would not say I had a lot of glitches in this game at one point there were some touch sensitivity but the game was still fun.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B00JVZ0DQG 4 1400716800 29 This game is very addicting. I don't like the wait for things to process it drives me crazy. But it gives me something to do with my spare time.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B005V1N71W 5 1359936000 30 I have always loved pandora. Its just as good on the Kindle Fire HD. The sound is great and all the information about the song is there on the screen.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B008VRQNIC 2 1359936000 51 I refuse to get a *free* app and still have to pay for everything IN the app. I don't mind paying for an app but when it is offered for free and you still have to pay for &#34;Coins&#34; in the game to be able to do anything I'm not impressed.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B00AZOVLUO 4 1359936000 26 My kids love this app. even if they do not get the concept completely they like popping the balloons and changing the colors when they can.
A12P9CHYM0TA7E B004SJ3BCI 5 1359936000 21 Its Angry Birds..... who doesn't like angry birds. Kid Friendly for my kids ranging from 4 to 8 they love it.
A12PBK4DZI8UVP B00AA87JGU 5 1374624000 30 The levels are easy at first, then they get harder. Plays really well on kindle fire. Have not had any problems with it kicking me out. Would recommend to friends.
A12PBK4DZI8UVP B008N3TLNI 4 1369440000 24 play this game all the time. like that you can have more than one game going at a time. i would recommend this game.
A12PBK4DZI8UVP B00881VLCE 3 1338768000 45 the game works good on &quot;fire&quot; except for that top piece. very frustrating when you're almost done and you can not move that last peice. other than that graphics are pretty good. alot of puzzles to choose from and there are free puzzles as well.
A12PBSSBKJWBN1 B005ZY5U2E 1 1324080000 25 I tried force closing it, but it kept restarting. Had to uninstall it to make it close. Too bad. It seemed like a decent game.
A12PBSSBKJWBN1 B004MC8CA2 5 1326758400 33 This Bible app has alot of translations and languages and reading plans. It's my favorite Bible app on Android. Several reading plans are from blue letter Bible - the most awesome Bible site!
A12PDCUJ569W75 B00ARRDTX6 4 1371513600 28 This is a very simple app and my 2 year old likes it. It consists of putting a puzzle together and some sound effects once it is done.
A12PDCUJ569W75 B00BWA8BAS 5 1382400000 22 We like the cartoon. This is a fun little game where you launch Finn to increasing distances. My sons really liked this.
A12PDCUJ569W75 B00AQF8CJ0 5 1378598400 30 Aside from solving puzzles, failing to solve puzzles is fun, too. There is something about the animation--maybe the shocked look on the monsters' faces--that makes the game fun to lose.
A12PDCUJ569W75 B004LOMB2Q 5 1393977600 25 I use evernote to take notes in class. I can create notes before meetings on my desktop and make minor edits in class and meetings.
A12PDCUJ569W75 B006DJ2JSI 4 1382400000 32 I purchased the American Heritage Dictionary 3d. on my other android device. This app is free and still shows word origins and alternative spelling. There are several definitions per word. Very useful.
A12PDCUJ569W75 B00AAX68HG 5 1371513600 22 Challenging puzzle game. It even makes failure fun since the objects react with a surprised face when they fly off the table.
A12PG3FWDTZVN7 B00846GKTW 5 1340928000 82 I just luv this game it is the best game that I have ever decided to get the rest of my games are kind of birding so I just desied to get it one day but it is my best game great for kids to ok so every one get this app but fore all the people who don't like this game you sick ok so see you later and check out my youtube so see y'all later well may be not.
A12PG3FWDTZVN7 B0061SLW7A 5 1357430400 22 I just love this app its amazing I hope everyone enjoys it rate it five stars its just such a cool app.
A12PG3FWDTZVN7 B008Y7SMQU 5 1351209600 25 it is very Gus for kids you should get it house Joe your a ho you need a job got it get it got it
A12PH00HFV7N7Y B004MNO0BQ 5 1308009600 21 on my Asus transformer. not sure what enhancements are in this version but it sure does play better than the original.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B009C7JS14 5 1361404800 46 I have an HTC smartphone and the greatest weather app I  have ever seen in my entire life! I am a weather watcher and so a weather app is an absolute must for me and to have it on the Kindle is pretty great and awesome!!!
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00AKL1XPU 4 1379980800 65 This is an easy review for me, because being that I love build it games, I am very picky. Like this one because it is cause oriented around animus and is a good game for kids. As far as graphics go, it is good but could be just little bit better, but there's lots of items to choose from, so that is definitely a plus.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00ESNW58K 3 1395532800 258 I am generally easy to please when it comes to what appears to look like an easy child's game, but this one actually has me asking why sometimes it's really hard and 'what am I supposed to do next?' Where at that point, I just close out of it and don't return for a long time to play like when I get a notification. I don't like how expensive the crystals are and I don't like how slow and forever it takes to get replenished with crystals. Overall, the game is just not that fun or interesting to me and where I only stick around because the art design is very pretty and pleasing to the eye in size, but the games (I never really liked those kinds of games where you match 3 and I was surprised that this game would even have that. That's probably the biggest single reason why I am not that eager to play this game. I like rescuing the animals and I think it would be nice if you have a certain amount of time before the island disappears, then I think it should be easier to rescue the animal in a shorter amount of time or don't put a time limit on an island. Also because it takes so long to get crystals to finish a bridge makes it that much less interested in playing this game. From my review, it seems I've come up with more negatives than positives, but I still see potential because I love &#34;rescue animals&#34; games.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B0094BB4TW 5 1361404800 26 Facebook is so popular, the Kindle is popular and again I am thankful I can have this app on the Kindle HD Fire!!!  Happy camper, Me!
A12PIIW06AVG51 B008P1EWIM 5 1361404800 34 If you like your weather live, then this is the app to get. I just love high techy weather apps, the more real, the more I like it, and this one is like that...
A12PIIW06AVG51 B007SYWFRM 5 1379721600 52 This is such a cool and fun game. I love building game apps and I love this movie, so it was easy for this game to become an instant favorite. Easy and a lot of fun to play with. I can't wait to see more animated movie game apps in the future.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00881VLCE 3 1361404800 44 I didn't like most of the choices for puzzles and it was pretty hard to get the puzzle pieces to fit. Maybe I just didn't know how to play the game. I wouldn't purchase this and I probably won't play it much at all.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00ANT4OHS 2 1361404800 84 All the car does is drive through different kinds of scenery. It should be more like Zombie Road Trip since this is a &#34;clean&#34; site (meaning no blood), there could be some kind of obstacles to divert and play around with, but it doesn't. I lost interest quickly....  sorry  (the scenary is good ... maybe should be where at the end is the goal and the fantasy destination of like a vacation site or something)  JAI: J ust  A n  I dea .... :)
A12PIIW06AVG51 B0088QGB7Y 5 1391212800 103 I gave this  game five stars because ever since I downloaded an  started playing, I couldn't get enough. I kept coming back it. It's a lot o  fun growing food and getting free prizes, the games you can play every time I come back to the game. It's like a multi-toy for me; there's so much to do and it makes it fun and interesting ...it's the dirtiest best ever. I hope to get more and better free prizes. Also, just would like to be able to get animals with coins, though, instead always cherries. It takes too much time to collect cherries.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B009HHX414 5 1361404800 31 I can text with my close friends and call thru my Kindle.... what's BETTER than that!!  Words can't say.... I am loving this app and thankful it is there for free!
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00BFUUMO8 5 1380153600 31 I just absolutely love this game. Great graphics, lifelike and it is worth the time to play it and get to levels. I am looking forward to getting to level 20!!!
A12PIIW06AVG51 B008MM9630 4 1380931200 51 This is one of my favorite games. The graphics are really, really pretty. It's fun to grow plants and add other things. My only gripes about game app is I wish the pictures in the menu shop were larger and that it didn't take so long to acquire more land space.
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00BT21K98 2 1364083200 74 I clicked on download on the amazon shopping page and read instructions that the app would be in the Kindle, but it wasn't there and I could not find it, so I'm hoping that the app developer or Amazon email me as to how to find this app on my Kindle. I said &#34;didn't like it&#34;, because I don't like something as simple as following instructions and then the app not even be there!
A12PIIW06AVG51 B00AR83PN4 2 1362873600 49 My fav is Cubistry...playt that all the time and since I love &#34;cube&#34; games, I have this one as a back up. It's not as much fun as Cubsitry. It just seemed kind of &#34;messy, maybe, to me&#34;; could not really see or grasp the concept of this game.
A12PISUK74LLFL B006C1DH92 5 1326326400 56 I really enjoyed this app. I got it on the day it was free, and I love it. it has a lot of features that fruit ninja doesn't, like the ' desperado' (survival) mode.  This is a great game with lovely graphics and I recommend that you get it. You won't be disappointed by this game!
A12PISUK74LLFL B0053TKBMU 5 1345161600 46 I am very happy with this app. I find the sounds very relaxing and the timer setting is very nice. It is also great that you can play more than one sound at a time. I would recommend trying this app, you will not be disappointed!
A12PISUK74LLFL B007U7BIO8 2 1342828800 43 I got this app on kindle fire, and every time I tried to change the alarm sound or test an alarm sound, it closed out of the app and brought me home. I am disappointed because this seemed like a pretty nice app.
A12PISUK74LLFL B006D1ONE4 5 1343001600 89 I got this because one day the paid version was available for free, so I thought I might as well give it a try. My brother really likes it and I do too. After you play it once, it becomes really fun and challenging (not always a bad thing...) and overall enjoyable. This is one of the few apps on my kindle fire that I've actually kept, because it doesn't get old quickly. If you enjoy puzzle games like Cut the Rope, I would recommend this. Very fun app!
A12PKGMWF8OUVI B0064X7FVE 1 1321315200 22 It is pretty useless without radar maps. I can't believe they left out something so basic. I'm looking for the delete button.
A12PKGMWF8OUVI B004EBZX6W 5 1321747200 31 I wanted this app on my iPhone, but Apple killed it. I was happy that I could get it on my Kindle Fire. It really helped me optimize my wifi network.
A12PKGMWF8OUVI B004N8W292 5 1321574400 27 Once I figured out how to get my bibles from my account downloaded to my pc and transferred via USB to the Kindle Fire, it worked great.
A12PLI2ZELVQXJ B006OCM13M 5 1332720000 40 its extremely fun and addicting its so fun i play it everyday but there is one error that i get sometimes, kindle fire it doesn't let me use my gifts , but other than that i would rate it 5*.
A12PLI2ZELVQXJ B00992CF6W 4 1358553600 24 Its AWESOME but its a little costly if u have $7.00 u should really get it I did and it's WORTH IT every PENNY!
A12PMEOLAKG34F B00FAPF5U0 5 1400025600 19 Most fun and challenging game I have played in a while. I only wish I had more lives.NATALIE MILHOLLIN
A12PMEOLAKG34F B00B2V66VS 5 1362441600 23 I thought it was great!!!!!!!!!;) &deg;&middot;&deg; it's a fantastic game everyone must try it you can ask uYou bff if they like thisU~Lauren~
A12PMEOLAKG34F B009UX2YAC 4 1383609600 66 Subway surfers is a good game fun too although it needs minor improvements. It could have better graphics and it could make thing such as avatars a little easier to get. Some of the things require a certian amount of an item that is rare to get, I understand that alot of people enjoy challenges like that. For the most part it is a good game.Sencerily,Anonymous
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B00768WTXA 4 1338076800 48 The screens on this hidden object game are vibrant and very nice.  Lots of butterflies and such to find.  I just wished there was more when I got done.  There is no story and there is no other type of game.  This is purely for the searching crowd.
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B00IEQDOLO 3 1398729600 28 I found it hard to figure out some of the directions and it is hard to see the items particularly on my phone.  Otherwise, good Hidden Object Game.
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B004FOA84A 4 1338076800 58 The only bad part of this review is that there are only two graphic adventure games from Maple Fire.  Please bring on more like this one.  Great game.  Lots of puzzles to check out and interesting roaming about the house.  The graphics are very nice too.  I thought the end was a bit lack luster, but over great.
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B0074AKEDC 5 1338076800 46 Great games and variety to this one.  Colorful and fun story too.  This is one of the longer playing games and well worth the money.  If you love graphic adventures with puzzle play and search and find, then this is for you.  Bring on more please.
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B0073LWEXK 5 1338076800 94 I love this game.  This is what Puzzle and hidden Object People are looking for.  The length of the game is great for the price.  The graphics are great.  There is a lot of variety in the game play too.  I did get a little lost moving from one part of the map to another.  I wish you could have a jump feature to go from one end to another screen instead of running about from one side to the other.  I wish Maple had more games.  I hope they will release more soon.
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B006ZE9Q5A 4 1338076800 53 Ahoy matey.  This is a fun adventure with lots of hidden object fun.  There are some other puzzles mixed for variety.  The graphics are fine.  I would like to see more like this.  I like the length of the game.  I also am glad that he had hints for when you need them.
A12PSA6ZDPI5BM B006JNH7YY 4 1348790400 34 Good game, and I thought the length was nice. I particularly liked that it even had post game play.  I thought it was challenging but not too hard and had some great theme concept.
A12PTM4JFM4F15 B007JYI4SU 1 1333584000 21 its picking from random emotions very lame like seriously this app wicks like a kid links a lolipop do not get
A12PTM4JFM4F15 B005UQ9FNC 5 1325376000 20 this is an ok game its is not adictin ht I have had a good amount o fun dough Lol
A12PTM4JFM4F15 B004SJ3BCI 4 1324857600 21 I don't think its that good bt mi.opinions don't count its a game that does nt work the way u want
A12PTWBV1X2URK B007SYWFRM 2 1398297600 26 App was fun but stopped working on the third day.  That was really disappointing.  Tried contacting Gameloft but got no reply.  Guess they don't really care.
A12PTWBV1X2URK B004I125GO 5 1370044800 22 This ap is great because I use Fandango a lot at home.  Now I can take it on the road with me.
A12PTWBV1X2URK B00IKZX1ZI 5 1398902400 24 It's addictive.  You have to have a lot of control to not purchase more lives.  The graphics are cute and the play is good.
A12PUUF1ISL9A6 B0066W1AZK 5 1360886400 28 I enjoy it.  I haven't played chess in a while and my skills are rusty.  So it's nice to be able to reverse bad moves and win sometimes.
A12PUUF1ISL9A6 B004Z92T9W 5 1360886400 21 Old favorite of mine.  I enjoy using it and it brings back memories of the old days.  Thanks for the fun.
A12PUUF1ISL9A6 B008XAKC98 3 1360886400 58 It spends a great deal of time constantly buffering...  You cannot pause it or come back to it because it goes back to the very beginning.  It seems that the buffering always happens at key points in the movie, but it never happens during commercials.  Overall, it's ok.  I have gotten to enjoy the movies with many interruptions.
A12PUUF1ISL9A6 B00FAPF5U0 3 1388880000 86 I was able to figure out the process of the game.  I reached level 23 but cannot seem to go beyond it.  It seems that the game is now geared towards getting us to obtain extra moves and lollipops to continue with the game.  No matter how close I get (with one jelly left), I run out of time.  I will keep trying to pass this level, but I am beginning to doubt it can be completed as it is.Revised two days later:  I did it!!
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00634GHJA 4 1372118400 46 a quick app using wifi to get photos or to send them, the only drawback is haing to enter that code EVERYtime you do go to say a desk top , if that step could be omited, I would rate it a 10 star, love it
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B005SE8IFW 5 1372118400 27 love the effects you can create on the photos and be ablre to upload the photos to my desktop , like the results and ease at using
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00COQOUE0 3 1368835200 39 Not much of a challange, a lot of duplicate of objects same ones in every scene with few additions.....tedious, the graphics are nice but that is about the only thing positive about it......and even that is so/so........no real challanges
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B007MC8YLQ 4 1391126400 35 fun to play and achievement awards are also varied and fun to achieve,  keep trying to beat my best time and moves, a lot of fun and passes the time while waiting for appts etc....
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00BOUROR2 2 1381104000 24 Started ok until the cards took a life of their own and flew off the screen!!! Freezing the game, frustrating a waste of time
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00HFTHXMC 5 1395446400 20 A lot of fun, similar to Phlinx but way more fun, with different playing fields. Would definitly re comend it
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B0093BM38O 3 1364947200 31 lots of fun to play in various modes,  wish the hard catagory was harder, the answers seemed quite tame in all catagories and not very challenging even in the hard mode
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00AUXZJAS 5 1393200000 36 Great challenges, look simple but are a real mental workout, found that I am improving in some areas in my daily life, a REALLY GOOD app.  Fun, lots of variety, works a plethera of brain functions
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00702PZME 2 1404691200 13 Too easy, no challange no choice of hard, or easy, allwere too easy
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B004DM1ZQY 1 1391126400 114 It is totally slanted in favor of the computer oponent.  I play at the hardest board and doubles are rolled constantly by the computer opponent and I had zero doubles. also on opening roll, the &#34;good&#34; rolls, ie 4/6 3/5 6/5 etc are always ALWAYS given to the computer opponent........no random play of the dice ever, and when you use the doubling cube and it appears that you have a slam dunk at winning, all of a sudden, double after double on the dice shows up when it is the opponents play......really a waste of time, takes the fun out of playing by not having a random dice play,  awful........dont waste time or money,
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B007MPJQ38 4 1367539200 70 I really enjoyed this, I am not use to games that you have to think,  usually played board games so this was a challange, especially the puzzels you need to solve to move to the next thing,,  no hints,  found the walkthrough and that was a super help to say the least,  it was entertaining and fun to play really gave my brain old as it is a good workout
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B0097HSS4M 1 1364947200 20 no big shakes,  very VERY basic,  effects suck,  a waste of space,  no real avangarde options, total blah boring boring
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B0089Z3D02 3 1354492800 32 I am a club pogo member and was disapointed that there were so few games to play, could not access any of my favorite games or the hidden object or crossword ones
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00A4KVFLY 3 1395964800 44 They nickle and dime you, you get to play free once a day and then you have to buy coins to play more or to spin a wheel to &#34;win&#34; coins gets expensive but it is funto play even if only once a day
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00A79N0I8 1 1368835200 86 Major waste of both money and time.......seemed more like a scam to get you to buy more and more coins to use on a game that just never paid off.........I didnt buy any more than the free ones they first give you which of course gets you nowhere and useses it up quickly so you need to buy more of them in order to keep playing.........rather go to a nearby casino, think I would have more of a fair chance to win sometimes than this sham
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B00C7TAF3Y 2 1367539200 72 maybe it is just me, but I like games that take you from scene to scene wth fun graphics etc, this one is a BOX plain and simple , that is the ONLY scenery and it is a total bore to play, the 3 D effects do not save this from the snooze factor either, it is dark, and just not fun......at least that is how I found it........maybe I missed something
A12PWVAMEVBCXJ B008KVSIT6 2 1391126400 37 maybe it is for younger action players, just found it hard to play, I am not a gamer junkie so just didnt really understand what I was supposed to do or what the point of it was
A12PZ3T78TLF2B B008TY8PKG 5 1355270400 21 It kept my 5 year old grandson engaged. There are lots of levels to keep you interested. Could use more audio.
A12PZ3T78TLF2B B004SBX112 5 1356739200 23 My 5 year old grandson loves playing Angry Birds seasons. We have really bonded over this and other games. Great value for $.99.
A12PZ3T78TLF2B B00E8KLWB4 1 1396742400 44 I didn't feel that anything really happened. It sends you from one place to the next and the only thing you are doing is reading what it has to say that sends you to the next stop. I deleted it after about 15 minutes.
A12PZ3T78TLF2B B004SJ3BCI 5 1359936000 22 It's easy for my grandkids to pick up the skills needed to play this game. Good for quiet time or rainy days.
A12PZ3T78TLF2B B004XMWJIC 5 1359936000 41 Mt grandkids love to play with this. There is a range of colors, 3 sizes of lines and some geometric choices. A  bit more to it than I thought there would be, but not too much and not complicated to navigate.
A12PZ3T78TLF2B B0064DBE9I 5 1359936000 88 It's not for playing anything serious, but it is fun for kids to play with. It has one octave and a list of different sounds such as violin, piano and guitar. There are also several melodies that can be chosen, and then the keys that should be played are hi-lighted. The only drawback is that it doesn't seem to tell you when to hit the same key more than once or hold for a longer time. The key just stays lit up until you hit it enough times.
A12PZXS7TR13I5 B007MTQ8C6 1 1360022400 22 Not very good program. The program is not smooth in the least. The program jumps and drops visuals when dealing the cards.
A12PZXS7TR13I5 B0064X7FVE 5 1360022400 34 I probably use this app more than any other app I have. This is a must have for any one who travels or works outside. Weather at your finger tips. Another great tool. Thanks.
A12Q283993B3ZQ B007MNV5WU 2 1337472000 43 I do love this game. The new playing mechanic is great. But, I can not help but feel upset that I paid more for less content than users on other platforms. The game itself deserves more stars, but I won't overlook being shorted.
A12Q283993B3ZQ B00CF34B2I 4 1392854400 147 The Magic 2014 app has been giving many 1st gen Fire owners troubles during install. I had the same issue, but after a few failed install attempts I succeeded. I had reset factory default settings multiple times after failed installations, so I had enough storage. When I pressed install, instead of watching it download from the apps marketplace, I clicked the new notification in the upper left corner. Open the Magic 2014 notification and monitor the entire download, prevent sleep mode by tapping the screen(for me this took over 20 minutes.) I did the same when the progress bar was full and install began. The install process took the better part of an hour, just keep preventing sleep mode. I was surprised when the screen finally changed and a Wizards logo appeared. The app downloaded more elements for a few more minutes and was ready for play.
A12Q283993B3ZQ B00CKW6FVE 4 1371686400 49 I really enjoy the game. The bite size bouts against the falling blocks plays very well on my Kindle Fire. The only reason I held back the last star stem from my belief that this game begs for you to purchase content too frequently, even for a freemium game.
A12Q283993B3ZQ B00B2V66VS 3 1364947200 27 This game is okay. I play it to kill time. I am only reviewing this game so I will not be prompted to review the game anymore.
A12Q555P8I4EOS B00CKG0A0C 5 1372723200 47 Love-love this slots game!! Graphics are outstanding and I find it hard to put down. The only thing I don't care for is the pin-up slots. My grandchildren play games on my kindle and I had to try and explain why the woman had no clothes on.
A12Q555P8I4EOS B00H343YNQ 5 1390521600 106 1Up Casino Slots is the best slots game I have played. Graphics are great and music is nice. I love the fact that you don't have to get to certain levels to play a different game. You have a good selection of games to play. Also you are given a good amount of money to start out with which allows you to play longer. Even though the bets are high, the pay outs are good. A lot of other slots games only start you out with $500 which is a joke. I will be playing this slots game for a long time. LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!
A12Q555P8I4EOS B00ADPH2YO 5 1381017600 32 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS SLOTS GAME.  THE PAYOUTS ARE GREAT AND YOU CAN REALLY EARN A LOT OF MONEY. THE ONLY THING I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IS THEAUTO PLAY STOPS FUNCTIONING.
A12Q6A76LCD4CD B007TBAQCK 5 1387929600 20 Great slot game. Having different games in different rooms keeps the app from getting boring. Hours and hours of fun.
A12Q6A76LCD4CD B00975HIYU 5 1387670400 24 Good slot game. Free coins every 4 hours will keep you  playing. I have enjoyed this game for almost a year now. Highly recommend.
A12Q6A76LCD4CD B00IAQ3RJM 5 1398902400 32 Monster Busters is a great game.  I can't stop playing!  I love the different levels.  It is fun for all ages and no ads so far.  Definitely recommend everyone try this game.
A12Q6A76LCD4CD B00H1L6L86 5 1388534400 30 Free coins. Good game so far but doesn't always start up on the first try on the Kindle Fire.  Seems to have better pay outsthan other games I have played.
A12Q6A76LCD4CD B00AZZGOWI 5 1367366400 20 Fun game. If you like to build theme parks, you will like this game. Just getting started but already hooked.
A12Q6PJOE3GQIM B009LNHMLC 5 1398988800 30 This WordSearch App is lots of fun..reminds you of those WordSearch books you buy, and close as you can get to the paper copy.  But, be careful, it's very addicting.
A12Q6PJOE3GQIM B00D0VZLVE 5 1400025600 26 This app will make you think and is fun to play.  Beware, it's not as easy as you think, and it will become addicting very quickly.
A12Q70HS7E2CS B006QMYF0W 5 1360022400 23 Solitaire is a great game to relax with. we enjoy playing it in the car  - on the train.to create something to do.
A12Q70HS7E2CS B007SYXJ2C 5 1362614400 21 I can't seem to put it down still trying to figure out how to score points.  Again it is very addictive
A12Q70HS7E2CS B00B5KHZA2 3 1362614400 21 Its okay but I believe this if for children and not adults but still quite interesting where they hide the object.s
A12Q70HS7E2CS B00975HIYU 3 1373846400 21 It's okay palyed it once  - i still am working on how to win.  Will try when I get more time.

A12QMNT6QDXUCU B00CWY76CC 4 1372723200 20 Entertaining without being too easy or hard. Let's you relax while keeping your mind busy. Can't wait for additional levels.
A12QMNT6QDXUCU B00A9JG6RS 4 1356566400 27 An easy, fun-filled game. A nice change of pace. If you want a break without losing too much time, this can be a quick game to choose.
A12QMNT6QDXUCU B0085VR7WU 4 1349481600 21 Fun and addictive game once you get the rules down. Takes a while to adjust to the 'farkle' loss of points.
A12QMZGMXLBJJ B0071Q75AO 1 1329436800 50 I am begging most of the reviewers to go get some help in literacy as well as mental. I am so disappointed in you all. Most of you knocking the mental cases cannot spell. I will force myself to believe that most of you are under 10 that downloaded this.
A12QMZGMXLBJJ B0073U6WLG 5 1333238400 21 Nice.. Fast.. Precise.. no hiccups. Sweet devs! Highly recommended.Gettem. guys!Droid2drummer...( therefore its gotta be good enough for a coffee break) lmao

A12QOGEGR7HRXE B007ZGO7EM 5 1369180800 21 If you need something on your device that will help you add, subtract, multiply and divide, this will do the trick.
A12QOGEGR7HRXE B00CWY76CC 2 1386115200 23 The directions don't really help you understand how to play this game.  I got through one level then it was hard to complete.
A12QOGEGR7HRXE B00BYJ6BUO 4 1369180800 38 I was able to watch my shows, but every so often the system would fail and I would have to go back in to the app.  However, it remembered where I was, so it was no big deal.
A12QOGEGR7HRXE B004JZBGWI 4 1363046400 23 Saves notes seperately.  Easy to and quick to use when in a hurry.  I would recommend this for both Kindles and smart phones.
A12QOW5VRA0MP4 B00824BM76 3 1404691200 4 WAIT I HAVE THIS?????
A12QOW5VRA0MP4 B0052UZIFA 1 1391904000 27 Wasted my money. All I see is the hour glass to make it seem like its loading and then it goes back to my phones home page
A12QOW5VRA0MP4 B00G357N92 5 1405814400 23 I like it Alot Helps pass the time by. Keeps you cooking but don't burn the food or you loss money. Cook up

A12QOW5VRA0MP4 B00BM8UNUQ 5 1382572800 22 Great game so I brought the upgrade. I didn't know it was a trial but plays just as good as desktop version.
A12QOW5VRA0MP4 B008UXIDYE 5 1404691200 24 I USE IT IN CHURCH BUT STOPPED BECAUSE I DIDNT WANT THE PASTOR TO THNK I WAS TEXTNG. BUT I USE IT AT HOME

A12QR7NKKERLRT B00E1GOGJK 4 1389225600 45 I really like these kind of games , and so I thought I would give this one a try. Just started to play but so far this is fun ,it's a little different to get letters to help and three puzzles in one ,it's cool.
A12QR7NKKERLRT B008K8VDPU 5 1393200000 31 Lots of fun, haven't played it a lot yet ,but seems to be a lot of music to chose from ,and you can even change it to a different instrument ..
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B00AK2RHR2 4 1372377600 27 Very glad Flo and her friends made it to the Kindle. So happy to play! I could play for hours! I very well may play for hours.
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B008JGSM6G 5 1371340800 26 I wanted to try a new kind of game, so I tried Flow Free. AWESOME!!! Challenging, yet addictive. I am so glad I took a chance.
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B0064X7FVE 4 1375401600 24 Really good showing the weather. I hate the mPoints thing though. So freaking tedious. It really gets in the way of seeing the weather.
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B0064X7B4A 5 1372204800 30 Very glad that this app is on the Kindle! Enjoyed the game on Facebook. Now I can play with friends even when I am not on Facebook or my laptop.
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B00AV8YANY 5 1374451200 25 Nice twist on a traditional word search app. Different types of words and different ways to find the words. Russian, Spanish and French words .
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B00DJK2TO8 5 1377561600 20 Saw this on an ad from Flow Free and decided to try it out. Awesome! All kinds of song titles.
A12QUSJF8RQ0TN B005KC664W 5 1387324800 20 I love the interface and the ability to change colors, as well as the many choices of games! So fun!
A12QXVPZY7336E B004SBQGHS 5 1346284800 20 thank you paid FREE app of the day finally I can remove the freaking adds off of my angry birds!!!!!!!!

A12QZCTZGYKA5G B0064X7B4A 5 1334448000 88 ok so I got this game becuz it was free. I lil free games despite the reviews it got I gpf it anyways. its OKAY. but it seems all the people are bots ... they never talk and it takes a really really long time for them to make a move. It looses a star for the fact it takes a really long time for random opponents to respond.(this coming from a really impatient 13 year old) other han tht this app works perfectly on my kindle fire!
A12QZCTZGYKA5G B004SJ3BCI 5 1334448000 53 I LOVE ANGRY BIRDS SO MUCH. IT'S SO SIMPLE YET FUN! i try to get all the stars in every level , but i really am horrible at it. Sometimes it makes me rage at how hard it is. But i'm going to give it all starts since its really well constructed. :)
A12QZCTZGYKA5G B0067VKQLE 5 1334448000 62 This is just what the name says. Plants vs zombies! i mean i got this on my kindle and it runs smoothly. So i have no reason to complain. If you're complaining on the actual gameplay, you should have looked it up on YouTube before you bought it. If it doesn't work on your Kindle... tough luck, because it works on mine.
A12QZCTZGYKA5G B005HSL626 5 1334448000 57 This is a really good game for when your bored. I play it all the time. You can even like challenge your friends to beat your score. Some people complain about Open feint but honestly i don't know what it is or what it does... but it doesn't really effect me much so i don't care! :D
A12R1MF8WAIJHG B00AZZGOWI 5 1389139200 32 I'm too busy playing this game. Awesome to waste time on. Keeps me busy from laying around. A awesome game to build a amusement park. Recommend for all ages and everyone.Download it!!

A12R1MF8WAIJHG B00H0BGCJK 5 1398038400 22 I could play it all day but the hard but is a awesome looking monster. Funny it can be it's really good.
A12R6819I0O81H B008XG1X18 5 1350777600 47 Love this app!  Have it on my phone and Fire works great on both  Now I can pin anywhere as well as see my boards as well as those of the people I follow.  Much easier than going to the web on my Fire and doing it.
A12R6819I0O81H B008Y7SMQU 4 1351036800 30 Fun &amp; challenging.  Makes you realize how much you pay attention to and are familiar with in the world of brand names &amp; logos.  Especially things you use every day.
A12R6819I0O81H B008FC58ES 5 1361145600 47 Love this game!  I have it on my kindle and mobile its great to have when waiting in line somewhere.  Graphics are great and I like how easy it is to pick the level you want to play.  Looking forward to trying other games by same company
A12R6GB0SW9SXA B00A4KVFLY 4 1367193600 46 This game is fun and I recommend getting it, but some improvements I think are needed are a more complete list of friends to choose from for help, especially those who play and also credit for words that are similar ie: run &amp; jog, pluralist, etc.
A12R6GB0SW9SXA B00BJSJKJ4 4 1366934400 23 Reminiscent of childhood family games. Seems to be more challanging. But age could be a factor in that! Love that it is free!
A12R6GB0SW9SXA B00702PZME 5 1330041600 20 Great for exercising your brain and fun too! It's hard to put it away. I gaurantee you will love it.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B004GVV4T0 3 1360454400 25 Have only played this app a few times, but looks interesting.  It sometimes was a little monotinus to play but will go back to it.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B0052832G4 3 1360454400 22 Not what I thought it was going to be.  Play it every once n a while, a little too young for me.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B0094BB4TW 5 1360454400 21 Like to keep up on facebook when I'm away, and this app does it.  I would recommend this app to anyone.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B00BGBZGEW 4 1370908800 29 It's an OK game for the older children. Some of the pictures are really hard to grasp what they are so it will take awhile for them to solve.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B006PJ3UKC 5 1360454400 22 I look at this app everyday to keep up on the news.  I would recommend this app to anyone on the go.

A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B004K4RY9M 4 1360454400 23 Have only used this app a few time but it did pass the time.  Going on vacation so we&#34;ll see house it works.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B0064X7B4A 5 1360454400 25 Love it. Love it.  I play everyday with friends and now I can take it with me.  I would recommend this to everyone who plays,
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B00A4KVFLY 4 1360454400 28 Have played this app a few times and it is OK.  It doesn't give you enought time to read the question and type before you time is up.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B0063IH60K 5 1360454400 20 This is a great app.  When I can't sleep at night I play this.  I would recommend this to anyone.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B009ZS2B28 3 1360454400 22 Just started playing this app. I love playing Bingo so hopefully this app will work out. It seems OK but we'll see.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B0055DL1G4 5 1360454400 21 Love this app. I go to it everyday to catch up on new happening now.  Would recommend this app to anyone.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B004R49A4W 1 1404691200 10 Not what I expected. Too hard for me to use.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B004SJ3BCI 5 1360454400 21 This game is addicting.  You just want those bird to get all of the pigs.  I could play this for hours.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B008P1EWIM 3 1360454400 32 This app did not give me enough information for the cities I was looking at.  I gues I'm use to the weather channel and this is not what I was looking for.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B009KS4XRO 5 1360454400 20 Love this app, as I play Bingo everyday. I would recommend this app to anyone who is on the go.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B00BWBHIUG 3 1394150400 28 great app for the younger children, a real learning tool.  I would recommend this for any child that wants to know more about how our eco system works
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B0087TQYUG 5 1360454400 21 I play this app nearly every day.  I would recommend this to anyone. You get to challenge friend to new friends.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B009WJNXAE 5 1362787200 21 I love playing Bingo and Bingo Bash is great.  It is easy to play and connects to my points on Facebook.
A12RCE3OS1KFG9 B007AL48UK 4 1384214400 25 I love playing Mahjong.  It keeps you entertained for hours. I would recommend this game to any one who likes to have a little challenge.
A12RGJ1YO6G73O B00BMH4GQE 5 1367539200 40 This  game is really fun. If you get stuck it gives you hints. This game really makes use my brain, and some times I can't figure it out. When that happens just ask a friend on Facebook. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
A12RGJ1YO6G73O B00BG3ID0Y 5 1366848000 20 This game is so fun. It really challenges my mind, and if you are stuck you can reviele a letter!
A12RGJ1YO6G73O B00D9SC4TA 1 1372204800 45 This is the worst game ever.it is so boring. And has no point. This game sucks.do not get.you can only do stuff to one of the girls. You put have to pay do poor the other ones. It is just a waste of your time
A12RGJCTPKIAG4 B009LQ8X58 5 1365465600 29 I use this program daily....Would highly recommend it to anyone that owns a tablet. It cleans both the tablet or the ad card. It really is a great program
A12RGJCTPKIAG4 B00E616R5Q 2 1385510400 50 This is a fun game. However, it freezes up all the time. Betting only 100,000 a spin, 38 million disappears very quickly. Have gone through millions with no bonus or free spins. Would be better if it gave more bonuses and wouldn't freeze and lose all you have just gotten
A12RGSX78QC0B B006D1ONE4 5 1325635200 30 I was not sure I would like this game, but it is so much fun! It is very addicting. It is a great puzzle solving game for the whole family!
A12RM5W1M4U0O4 B007NACZPI 5 1332720000 24 I think its a cool game. its fun and it takes time to complete. I enjoy it. they should make another game like this
A12RM5W1M4U0O4 B007SYWFRM 5 1334707200 22 this game reminds me of a game called tiny village. I love both of these games. they are the best games ever
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B0064X7B4A 5 1356566400 25 Works just as well as the iPhone app does and makes it easy for you to keep up on your games while you are reading.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B007SYWFRM 3 1358726400 25 So I tried this App out and its slightly fun but it gets pretty boring after awhile and its the same thing over and over.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B005ZV46E0 5 1356566400 24 Works as good as any Yahoo app available. Makes talking to friends through yahoo IM easier when I am on my Kindle Fire HD.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B004UID2LC 2 1356566400 24 The set up is weird, and its hard to navigate through it. They should fix the app to be more like the iPhone one.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B009HKL4B8 5 1360540800 33 It is so much fun to play this on a larger screen like the Kindle Fire HD! Plus it is free so you get to enjoy the Sims experience without paying a lot!
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B004TTY694 5 1356566400 35 Works just like the iPhone notepad app which is great because when I am on my Kindle Fire HD I sometimes remember things I need to write down and this app comes in very handy.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B0094BB4TW 5 1356566400 26 Works as good as any iPhone facebook app does, making it easy to talk to friends on there while reading books on your Kindle Fire HD.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B005V1N71W 5 1388707200 36 I love this app because I like listening to music but my playlist gets old fast. With this app I can listen to a bunch of different music and even find some I haven't heard before.
A12RNPBA6RHPIG B00AESN8XY 5 1388707200 32 I love this app so much its super fun. Its interactive and has tons of different diseases you can try out not to mention you can name your disease whatever you like.
A12ROZB4DT8HRD B00D2K40WY 5 1371772800 27 It's a great game and I seriously recommend this game to the ages 5-13. It's great and I know for sure that little kids will enjoy it.
A12ROZB4DT8HRD B008CG839O 5 1354579200 29 this game is good for eleven and up. i love this game and its fun. i recemend this to alot of people. it ROCKS! its a top notch game!

A12ROZB4DT8HRD B006N1K1AE 5 1334361600 47 I love it. Its a great and amazing game to paint and draw and to see your creation in  two parts instead of one. I think kids and adults will love this game.I'm a truth telling 11year old girl and  I love it and you will too.:-)

A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B006OC2ANS 4 1330214400 23 its fun but it took up 94.4 Mb and it froze.  but otherwise super fun and not bloody. great kids game. no violence.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B007JPG04E 4 1331856000 33 sometimes it says edvice that's not true. and it does require some money if you want the best guns. but other wise great game. super fun. but yet again is a little bloody.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B005VTS4EY 5 1331337600 23 dude, who cares if its hard, that's the point of the game To THINK! I thought it was great. good job five stars.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B0086700CM 5 1338940800 25 great game and I know a cheat. turn on the tutariul and swipe three times on the first turn.I cant get my hands off it.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B0067VKQLE 5 1327276800 28 I love it. who cares if it does not have zen garden or mini games.  I'm addicted to it(its not violent) and I am on it every dau
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B005CD2TQ8 5 1332115200 27 great app. I cant get past level seven. it is a great game for my kids. wonderful free game. does not end up making you pay money.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B006K4O5BK 1 1328918400 26 looked cool on k.f. but it would never install. I tried but it just said installing... and then it didn't work. not good on kindle fire.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B004GVYXTS 5 1327104000 24 great game that has all sorts of catagories to choose from. you have a fair amount of chances and a fun game for all.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B004K55CQ8 2 1328400000 26 I agree. fun entertaining great. but I made these cool people on my kindle and I don't know how to save. that made it 2 stars
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B004N8KDNY 1 1329004800 20 a poorly made ripoff of plants vs zombies. what the frog is this game. terrible effects too! such a ripoff.
A12RS3RNJNO2J4 B007XKEY6Q 4 1337644800 24 takes a while to send the picture to the other person, but otherwise, awesome, if you watch smosh, Ian the character plays this game.!
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B007N5YIOO 4 1334188800 32 It's extremely fun and addictive, but way too short! More levels please! Needs lots more to justify the price. I achieved everything-3stars and all eggsteroids in no time.  Loads of fun otherwise.
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B008J4K6KI 5 1347062400 26 Addictive, fun for ALL ages, and even better than Top Truck! Definitely worth the $0.99! I recommend this for everyone-adults and kids-who enjoy playing physics games!
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B0087HT36U 4 1358553600 37 I wish they'd update with Age of Cowboys. It's been months and we've been waiting for it. Not sure why it's free in the Google Play store, but I bought it here and it's totally ad free.
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B00821L076 1 1357948800 72 The add-on is only good for one device. So if I want the $1.99 new tracks add-on available on all of my devices, I'd have to buy it THREE times to have it on my phone, tablet, and Kindle Fire. No thanks. That's a rip off. I did NOT buy it and due to this discovery I will look forward to NOT PURCHASING ANY MORE APPS FROM THIS COMPANY IN THE FUTURE.
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B00BTYP6QE 5 1366502400 49 Fun, cute, and every bit as entertaining as the first two. If you loved the others, you will love this sequel. I highly recommend it for kids and adults alike. At 99 cents you can't go wrong with this fun game! Help your Om Noms go &quot;Nom! Nom!&quot; :)
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B006D1ONE4 1 1336348800 21 Where's the damn update? Google Play Store has had the updated version and doesn't charge extra for the new levels. WTF!?!?
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B006OIK6JC 5 1328572800 29 Finally!!! A FREE custmizable greeting card app!!! I love it and so do my family and friends!!! I recommend this if you're looking for a free greeting cards app.
A12RTI1A9V9RUN B00AE9UYJ4 2 1359936000 43 The game is too short and too easy (though you can change the settings), but it's cute. I wish the UI was much better and there was more to the game play than just racing to collect 8 notes in order to win.
A12RYTFXE7BN1F B004GYVYV0 5 1301270400 125 I've been using this app for over a year now and think it's still be best money manager on Android. Devs do a great job of listening to users and adding/fixing features. Ten dollars is the most I've ever paid for an app but I consider it money well spent.Edit: I see this is the FAOTD today. Guess that means all the crazies are gonna come out to trash the rating for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual app. It's a shame, really, since this is a terrific app that does what it says and does it well. I'm still using it a year and a half later... not many other apps I can say that about, if any!
A12RYTFXE7BN1F B004SRLB1I 5 1301788800 51 Anyone who thinks this is a pointless app obviously does not have a 4 year old. My son loves this and laughs hysterically at it. It gets old after awhile but is worth it while it lasts. Of all the talking-something apps, this one is the best. Large file size though.
A12RYTFXE7BN1F B004N2NWT2 5 1303257600 67 People giving this one star because it doesn't work on a tablet automatically FAIL the moron test! If an app doesn't say it works on a tablet, you can't assume it will. That may change in time but right now the install base for tablets is nothing compared to phones. Anywho, this is a fun little app that's different than the usual kind of game on Android.
A12RYTFXE7BN1F B004KAL2BC 5 1305849600 45 I've recently gotten into the twitter scene and tried all the relevant apps on Android. This is the one I liked best and still use today. I've only had the free app so it will be nice to upgrade and lose the ads. Thanks, Amazon!
A12RYTFXE7BN1F B004GISARW 5 1301011200 36 This might be my favorite Android app of all! Nice clean interface, super fast, intuitive navigation, small footprint, accurate information, and FREE!! I wish all apps were as well designed and efficient as this little beauty.
A12S23K236H53D B00ET56Y48 5 1402444800 30 THIS IS THE MOST AWESOME GAME EVA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! U CAN BUY AND UPGRADE TOWERS BY USING MEDALLIONS WHICH U GET FROM WINNING AND LOSING!!!!!!!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!THE END!!!!!!!
A12S23K236H53D B00F54F1G4 1 1392249600 99 You know when you buy a app sometimes you forgot to look at the reviews? Well that's why I rate this one star. You see, I didn't  know there was premium version and then I was like &amp;#34;I NEED PREMIUM TO FINISH THE APP?!?!?!&amp;#34; And it was even getting to the good part OMG!!!!! Then that's when I finally looked at the reviews and I saw the premium version was $5.Then I checked how much money I had on my kindle and it showed $0.28. I can't even get an app that costs 59&Acirc;&cent;! Man, I hate this stuff.
A12S23K236H53D B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392076800 49 It is like flappy bird . Really fun. Even Tobuscus played it ( If you don't know who Tobuscus is he is a Youtuber that has over 5,000,000 subscribers ). At the start it's really hard but after a whileyour high score will be like 43 or something.The End
A12S23K236H53D B00GMSZCMK 3 1395100800 35 I don't really love this app. I hate that you have to wait thirty minutes after playing. If you pay 99 cents you don't have too wait. Would have been five stars if no waiting.&amp;#62;=(
A12S23K236H53D B009UWL580 4 1388275200 22 fun but sometimes when I turn offmy kindle waiting for more grabs for 1hour then I get back onI have 0 grabs
A12S376KJDSL0A B006MI4JEM 5 1379116800 55 spend  hours  finding  words.  You  will  fine  easy  your  mind  will  grab  at the  words.  finding  new  ones.  challenge  yourself  to  this  mind  working  game.  you  will be  surprise  how  fast  you  can  learn.  we  older  folks  need  to  keep  our  brains  working  all  the  time.  you  might  like  to  have  your  grandchildren  play  too
A12S376KJDSL0A B0051UP5NQ 5 1386201600 36 I love the ease of this app. You can do a lot using it. Your set for the work you want to do. I love how your work can look so professional. Give it a try.
A12S376KJDSL0A B00AVGGYNA 5 1386201600 27 This is a good program if you want a bingo that out does most android apps. I enjoyed the clear clear sound as each number is called
A12S376KJDSL0A B00AGOGOLE 5 1386201600 35 This a great and fun camera app. I have been using it a lot. Your pictures will turn out great. Made my art look so much better than other camera apps. I have tried using
A12S376KJDSL0A B00EYUCAV4 5 1386806400 31 I am still a kid at heart and really loved this one. as a artist I l0ve trying new programs if it has anything to do with art. check it out
A12S376KJDSL0A B00H2I9F4U 5 1390003200 41 I love the cute action faces. I love the choices you have for picking the amount of automatic spins. Playing this one is so easy and looks good on my kindle fire hd. Come and play for yourself on this game.
A12S376KJDSL0A B00ADPH2YO 4 1390003200 21 Fun to play. Download it and start playing. Have fun. Relaxing and easy to play. Begin playing and see for yourself.
A12S376KJDSL0A B00BJCM3S0 5 1386201600 27 I feel this is great for ages. Love being creative. You can easily get attached to app. You might get wrapped up for hours creating new pieces
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B008183CTE 1 1338940800 24 It might have been a good app if it would actually download. I tried seven times but it still wouldn't download. it is crap.
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B005T87QCI 5 1328659200 62 this game is so cool. sure people say it does not work, but for me it did and I love it. if you liked the movie you will like the game. and for the people who said it didn't work well maybe you need to get a new device. And if you don't like it then you have bad taste in games!
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B0066T8M1I 5 1325030400 21 great app.haven't had any problems yet.downloaded it for free, so it is good for the price.have it for the kindle fire.
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B004SUWR2C 5 1334188800 40 this game is great. I can't stop playing this game. you play and unlock stuff it is so fun. and you can play with friends by the web or just a game where you pass the device I love it.
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B0058VW36U 5 1331510400 26 this app is awesome I think it works better on the kindle fire than on the ipod touch.it is one of the best games I have.
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B006K4O5BK 5 1326153600 20 great game. a real challenge. I like that. fun and awesome. If you like paper football you will love this.
A12S68IJ0U9P5S B0067VKQLE 5 1325721600 23 this game was the bomb literally the bomb. it is the best game I have, and probably the best in the app store
A12S6DW216QR8W B00B4VI8MQ 5 1363478400 23 I loved the way this game was set up, great story line. I really enjoyed this game and would love more like it!
A12S6DW216QR8W B0076POKVC 5 1358553600 41 I loved this game, challenging but not so hard you can't figure it out. Couple of puzzles I thought were very difficult and couldn't figure out, that was annoying. But loved the game and wished there were more like this one!!!!
A12S6R1T8S9U2A B00CEBKMN8 4 1398556800 26 I ENJOY PLAYING THIS GAME QUITE A BIT - IT IS FUN TRYING TO GET AS MANY OF THE PRIZES AND EXTRAS THAT I CAN GET.
A12S6R1T8S9U2A B008K6G8CK 4 1398556800 44 I LIKE THIS WHEEL OF FORTUNE SLOTS - KIND OF FUN TO TRY TO GET THE BEST SCORE ON THE BOXES I CAN GET.  HAVE PICKED THE $1000 BOX A COUPLE OF TIMES, BUT GAVE UP ON THE DEAL BEFORE GETTING THERE BOTH TIMES.
A12SBZKTU8QW7K B00H7WX7WM 2 1390435200 30 It does what it says it helps you draw manga. But after a couple of characters you have to buy them to learn to draw them which I didn't like.
A12SBZKTU8QW7K B009UX2YAC 5 1393027200 20 I love it. I'm pretty much addicted to this game. I ran out of things to say so yeah huh....
A12SBZKTU8QW7K B007JPG04E 5 1399593600 22 Best kindle game I have played so far I love it. I've only had it for a day and I'm already hooked!!
A12SGSFD0IC1 B00BIK524A 4 1386115200 37 It is fun but not addictive, which is good I guess.  But there are other mah jongs from Amazon that are truly addictive which I love more.  The one with the butterflies is great.  This is good.
A12SGSFD0IC1 B00FEIX5OG 4 1386028800 28 great but no clear info on menu of game as to what the stars I gain at each level mean!  But who cares cause the game is addictive.
A12SGSFD0IC1 B00BJA2VFW 5 1371168000 26 Yup, that is what I meant -- it is simply addictive.  I have to stop playing it at night because I am missing my bedtime. Beware!
A12SHN8SWUSWBS B00CDBLC8S 5 1371427200 36 It's similar to other games like this, but I like how this one gives coins. They're not too expensive, so you don't get stuck easily yet it's not too easy either. I like it. It's fun!
A12SHN8SWUSWBS B00BG3ID0Y 5 1370649600 22 Challenging yet fun.  I hate it when you know every puzzle and you're done in no time. This one is lasting me
A12SHN8SWUSWBS B00AR1AUAW 5 1358899200 20 It's challenging and totally addicting.  I love it!  This app is alsoHelpful in your daily life with an explained vocabulary.
A12SHN8SWUSWBS B00CAW96DI 5 1370304000 26 Challenging yet fun. Love it.  Sometimes when a game is too difficult, it's not fun, but this game is just right.  And it's free...what a deal
A12SHN8SWUSWBS B00BMH4GQE 5 1366416000 26 All ages can play. Not too easy and not too hard.  I love it!!  I like the amount of puzzles you get too.  Worth the download
A12SJLFUF6SQUH B00E4MCCF6 5 1389916800 20 This is a good app if u really enjoy puzzles. Would recommend to any1. Love the puzzle. Download and enjoy.
A12SJLFUF6SQUH B00FAPF5U0 4 1390780800 36 For me it gets frustrating 2 play if I don't clear the board the first time but I'm determined so the next x works wonders. Other than that I really like the game...a good past time.
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B007V2UGPE 5 1335052800 39 i think this game is amazing addicting and a favorite of mine you should get im surprised it isnt a dollar or more with the upgrades and allies theres not too many adds and i love this awesome app
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B00AO2P3GA 5 1358640000 24 this game is AWESOME good graphics good campain and a great multiplayer. i dont think ther is a better game out there right now
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B0058VW36U 5 1330992000 37 cut the rope it a great fun addicting cute and awesome app that i think is better than angry bird and just as good as where's my water if mot better overall the best app out there
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B009WYCDZU 5 1352937600 21 this app is fantastic great graphics and awesome cars! it takes a little loading but is fantastic and cool great buy
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B00DQ8APIK 3 1388966400 25 fun but annoying when you're stuck. google skills enhanced. weird brands I haven't heard of...not really best use of my time, but I like it.
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B006D1ONE4 5 1332460800 22 i think this game is better than angry birds and maybe cut the rope my mom wont stop playing it it AMAZING
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B00FAPF5U0 4 1388534400 41 I like the puzzle aspect of this game. cool different levels. I refuse to pay $ for helps, so can be frustrating at times to be stuck on a level....we'll see if I actually finish all of them in my lifetime.
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B006OCM13M 5 1330992000 28 This app is very very addicting and keeps me looking at it every other minuet to see what's happening and looking at other peoples shops also overall great
A12SKZTIWNXZTU B004MC8CA2 5 1330992000 24 this is an overall great app with every version and verse you need to read God's word i like how you can bookmarks stuff
A12SLJMCWFUYCW B00FAPF5U0 5 1382400000 28 Have been waiting a long time to finally get this app on my Kindle.  Absolutely love it.Don't know anyone who hasn't tried it that isn't forever hooked.Many thanks,Maddi
A12SLJMCWFUYCW B009WJNXAE 4 1382400000 27 This is a fun game and I have enjoyed playing it.  Some of the collections are a little puzzling. It is a good game for bingo lovers.
A12SLJMCWFUYCW B004JK61K0 5 1357689600 44 It was a real challenge being able to receive my emails on my Kindle Fire the regular way. My son-in-law did a lot of research and found this product, tried it and voila, now I am able to get emails on my Kindle Fire.
A12SN4MBU30P4N B008L29K6E 4 1381104000 24 This is a great way to pass time. I recommend it for anyone who likes logic puzzles. I have downloaded their other games also.
A12SN4MBU30P4N B006RM6JCI 4 1381104000 24 Good game for people who like logic puzzles. Pretty graphics and soothing background music. Plus it's free so well worth the time to download.
A12SN4MBU30P4N B008Y212PI 4 1381017600 25 This game is fun to use. Very simple but addictive at the same time. I would recommend to anyone who likes a good logic puzzle.
A12SN4MBU30P4N B007T8BYWE 4 1395532800 23 This game is very fun for the logic minded person. Great to waste some time doing some brain boosting activity. Would gladly recommend.
A12SO2DOWKBM55 B0054JZC6E 5 1342224000 27 love it this game its hard at times but fun and sometimes aggravating but I keep going back until I pass it and get a next level
A12SO2DOWKBM55 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1389139200 22 pretty good game kind of hard to figure out though other then that its a good game to play I like it
A12SQ89EQUGK65 B006QC53WG 3 1388966400 26 I just down loaded this one have not had that much play time with this one. But the few times I have played it was okay.
A12SQ89EQUGK65 B00BTL5YMI 4 1388966400 21 I like this game, very fun to play. I actually can't seem to put the game down once I start it.
A12SQ89EQUGK65 B00DBCJLOA 3 1388966400 22 It's okay, It would be a lot better if it would not keep freezing up on me. But I play it anyways.
A12SV0B3C4FAR5 B00E5NH6YG 5 1398643200 72 I pulled the plug on our cable/satellite plan a few months ago and have been watching my shows via online. So when I saw this app I was so excited! Easy to download, easy to navigate. Luckily, the shows that I have been watching to not require access to my cable provider, but Lifetime has plenty of shows and movies that you can watch for free. I love that they developed this!
A12SV0B3C4FAR5 B006P5IZYC 3 1398643200 80 This was an interesting app that put you as the writer of the story and developing story lines right along with the 'author' of the app. However, some of the choices are a bit odd and after awhile the story gets rather boring. It was great and it fell off. I am not sure if the creator thought people wouldn't get that far before going back and making other choices. It was a good start, I hope it gets better.
A12SV0B3C4FAR5 B006MI4JEM 5 1391126400 20 Easy to learn and fun to use while your on the go or just need a couple minutes to yourself.
A12SV0B3C4FAR5 B00AFCEIB0 2 1398038400 32 I am not sure what I was hoping for with 'google' in the title, however, the app just doesnt work very well. It is easier to use the silk browser. Unnecessary download.
A12SVQJXXMVYKQ B00CO6TOBY 1 1387065600 20 I  like  the  original  Tetris.  there  is  no  control  for  me.  probly bcause I cant  find  how  to  control  it.
A12SVQJXXMVYKQ B004TI2ZXY 3 1397174400 33 It works. Better on a laptop. Or 8 inch and up for ovius reasons. It want give voice directions on my phone or I cant figure out how to get it to that
A12SXESCIWX094 B00823EFEY 5 1342483200 36 This is a fun game for all ages! my six year old brother loves it I'm 11 and I love it and my 9 year old neighbor loves it! I totally recommend this game to everyone!!
A12SXESCIWX094 B004L24888 1 1335830400 32 I had read all the reviews and they sucked but I wanted to see what it wuz so I got it and it won't even open I do not recommend this app
A12SXEXUZTDVHJ B008IJTFYW 4 1349136000 32 The wind and waves do not sound natural,otherwise,it is very helpful. I love the temple setting.  It also stays on while the screen is off so light does not keep me awake.
A12T0OOUFWKHVT B00964BWFS 5 1360540800 27 my husband is completely unimpressed, and that's a heavy endorsement!!! don't know what I'll do once I've played it out..... look for more Playrix games, I imagine!!!!!
A12T0OOUFWKHVT B008JJS6D2 5 1362960000 41 this game gives you just enough credits to keep you totally addicted! and yes : I've given in to buying a few, as well! it's perfectly paced to prevent boredom AND has the added feature of collecting to a goal. sweet!
A12T0OOUFWKHVT B00BGC5UAG 3 1362009600 38 so, I'm around 60 levels in, I exit the game and come back to it 20 minutes later. shazam!!!  I'm started over at level one and my earnings are zero. zero happy, although I HAD been enjoying it!
A12T0OOUFWKHVT B00DJFIMW6 5 1375488000 32 This is the most addictive game ever! Bar none. No dishes get done,  no meals get made, and don't expect me to hold a conversation with ANYONE - I'm playing Minion Rush!
A12T0OOUFWKHVT B00CWY76CC 4 1374796800 29 Takes up considerable space for as simple as it is, but that's what uninstall is for! Makes for a much more pleasant waiting room stay at the doctors office!!
A12T0OOUFWKHVT B0073LHCCS 4 1361664000 24 sweet game!  needs more levels! for free,  I mean. so you can get properly addicted! could be slightly less obscure with the intended hilarity!
A12T14WEBZ9D14 B007XJ3D82 5 1365206400 37 Great security. My daughter has been trying to hack it for weeks. I like the color and font options and its great that I can add pictures to go with my entries, but the pictures are tiny.
A12T14WEBZ9D14 B0094BB4TW 3 1365206400 46 Not real Facebook, but better than Facebook mobile. I can't seem to look up people that aren't already on my friends list, haven't figured out how to make new pages, and my for sale sites only show so many posts then I can't access the rest.
A12T2VLJSL1JSR B009HN0V6E 4 1360281600 33 i love this app very much except update this app so it will have any new stuff the actual game has. so do that and i will give 5 stars. okay app tho
A12T2VLJSL1JSR B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393891200 33 Floppy bird is a fun game and this is similar to it and still fun. Even though I don't like similar copies of games, I like this since flapping bird was taken off.
A12T2VLJSL1JSR B00992CF6W 5 1360281600 41 im a big fan of minecraft and i highly recommend this app if you want minecraft on the go. works awesome on my kindle fire. works awesome with pocketinveditor. just keep adding the updates and this game will be awesome forever.
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B005ZISF8Q 4 1354579200 24 i like this magazine - i use it for recipes and quick tips.  its overall a great magazine and i'll probably always read it
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B004H6WTJI 5 1354579200 23 love this app - i like how it lets me keep track of fat, carbs, and protein - along with exercise and calories.
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B004TTY694 5 1354579200 26 easy to use -- i take a lot of notes and make a lot of lists for different things and this works well for my needs
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B005KC664W 5 1354579200 21 love sudoku and love how this one has so many different puzzles and levels to choose from. its an awesome game
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B004HMJ5QM 5 1354579200 25 i like being able to have all of this at my fingertips.  easy to understand and work and does what i need it to do
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B0061S5NNO 4 1354579200 34 i used this app for a long time and loved it until i decided that i needed to track how many carbs, fat, etc i was eating so i switched to a different program
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B0064TVQ5E 5 1354579200 22 mahjong deluxe HD free is AWESOME.  i love it - my husband and i like to try and beat one anothers scores
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B004T2P7MQ 5 1354579200 23 i like Mint.com because i can check everything online and on my kindle and its always up to date and easy to understand
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B006FKPVHQ 5 1354579200 21 it does what it is supposed to do and it is extremely easy to read.  its a calculator - self explanitory
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B0094BB4TW 3 1354579200 40 half the time i log into this app it will only show me like 10 updates on the wall - it would be nice to be able to see whatever i want to see when i want to see it
A12T2ZXXIHBH39 B004SJ3BCI 5 1354579200 26 angry birds is just so fun - no matter what age you are.  our whole household plays it and we try to beat each others scores
A12T3ATGXPCV1C B0071PARPA 3 1365033600 20 I like the things you can do with this app and it really is nice to start drawing some again.
A12T3ATGXPCV1C B0064X7FVE 4 1365033600 55 Great to know what the weather is going to be like when I am a busy on the go type of person. I don't have time to sit in front of the television and wait for the weather channel to come around for a detailed explanation of the weather, so an app helps me greatly.
A12T3ATGXPCV1C B004K4RY9M 2 1365033600 25 Its good but maybe I'm looking for more of a challenge. I don't know exactly what it is missing but it is a little bland.
A12T3ATGXPCV1C B00632HWOG 4 1365033600 31 I have used Yahoo mail for a very long time now and I was glad I could sync it to my phone so I can read my messages on the go.
A12T3ATGXPCV1C B0094BB4TW 4 1365033600 45 Its nice to have Facebook on the go, but when it comes to the wall it feels like it doesn't update as frequently as it should and some of the postings get their order mixed up even when it is on the most recent option.
A12T3ATGXPCV1C B0073G5PU4 3 1365033600 22 There is nothing overly awesome or bad at all about this app. It is just a calendar to keep me on track.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00DRHY8EW 4 1376352000 59 Really liked this one. The only reason for leaving off the fifth star is that it would have been nice to have a little narrative to make it more of a story. Didn't really feel like we got an explanation of what happened. Otherwise an interesting point and click adventure that was not too hard, not too easy. Fun.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B0091REZMW 1 1368144000 89 I love adventure games, but the joy is in walking through the story and playing it as a story. This has lists of how many times you can use a tool, how much energy you have before you have to stop, etc. And if you are not into social networking and group gaming, just forget it. There are so many technical details to monitor that the joy of exploring is lost.  It took me only a few minutes to decide to uninstall.  Sooooo glad I didn't pay for this....stuff.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00EJILIPA 1 1382140800 227 First, I have to say that if this game were reasonably priced I would have readily given it four stars. Point and click adventures are my favorite and it is hard to find many for kindle. If that weren't the case I would never have sprung for the overpriced $5 for the full game ... at least what I thought was the full game. Now I admit I get irritated by reviews that whine about adventure games having a free intro. Anyone who has played more than one or two of these games knows there is no such thing as a full version for free. Get a grip. However it is customary for the paid unlock to contain the entire game. When I got cut off at the end and realized it would cost another $2 to complete the game, I was not happy. As far as I am concerned, that is a bait and switch. So, like a sucker I paid for the ending. The big shock came when I had completed it in 10 minutes! I will never touch another game by this developer, and I hope other people have enough warning not to get sucked in. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. When you ask people to pay for a game, they have a right to expect everything in one price. Buyer beware.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00BJ9VBLI 4 1370476800 20 This game is fun, entertaining, and very relaxing. It is a nice twist on a favorite classic type of game.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B008BBB388 4 1373587200 152 Update: My thanks to the developers for correcting this problem. Good game.There is a scene, mentioned by other reviewers, where you have to retrieve a blue gem in the presence of a sleeping guard. On the kindle fire HD this gem is located immediately beneath the tab that pulls up the tablet functions on the side of the screen. It is impossible to retrieve this and impossible to move on without retrieving it. In other words you hit a brick wall and have to stop the game. So glad this happened during the free portion, or I would be pretty angry. I think I would have enjoyed the full game otherwise. This problem could easily be fixed by allowing a zoom function on HO screens, so we could scroll the object to a slightly different place on the screen.  As it is, the game is worthless for kindle fire HD. Don't buy.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00D99XZCY 5 1375315200 27 This was my favorite adventure game before it came to big fish and it is even better in this version. Let's see some more like this one!
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00J206J5E 1 1400371200 63 I was actually going to buy the full version when I ran into a glitch. I played the intro awhile back and didn't remember the details of where I left off. So I thought I'd replay the intro then buy the full version. I tried four times but the download fails every time. Guess I won't be buying the full version after all.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00HDPT2RM 3 1388793600 64 Sorry guys. I really think the price is too steep. If it were more like $3, I would definitely purchase. I really think $5 is too steep for just about any game. I enjoyed the story clips. There were a few too many HOG, but not so many as to ruin it. I did enjoy the game, just not enough to justify the price.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00DWJBOI8 3 1376352000 31 It is a good game, but shorter than most and definitely not worth paying this much. Maybe worth $1.99 for something this length. Save your money to buy 2or3 smaller ones.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00ASKP5PW 5 1368144000 61 I really liked this one. It had an engaging storyline in addition to the ho and puzzles. My favorite adventure games are the ones that play like you are a part of the story as opposed to the cheesy ones where the dialogue is forced and the storyline just a one-dimensional excuse for puzzles and objects.  This is a good one.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00I5WL0HW 5 1395705600 161 Another great game. Really loved the graphics and beautiful scenery. Good cut scenes. There were quite a few HOS. I like them, but I prefer fewer. One thing that gave the HOS a little more interest was the variance in style. Some scenes were the typical list, while others required you to find an object and then use it to find the next. There were plenty of minigames. My preference is really a true point-and-click adventure without the games, but I can still appreciate a good one in this style. The length was also good, compared to many which are too short for the price. My only real criticism is that most of the point-and-click adventure consisted of finding objects that fit like puzzle pieces into doors and boxes to open them. It's nice when a little more thinking is required in this aspect rather than the minigames.  Overall, I still loved it and look forward to the next. Five stars.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B008IJTFYW 5 1366588800 37 I have nature relaxation recordings but have always wished I could change some of the sounds or music. With this app it's all you. Choose what you want and mix it up. I can't believe it's free.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B004HXHVZ8 5 1370476800 31 Great app to store, view and look up new movies. Disc to digital is the best. Plus I can access from both my kindle fire HD tablet and my android phone.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00H83GGVO 3 1388793600 44 This game does appear to be aimed at a young audience. The intro is cute. Animation is well done. Won't hold the interest of a mature audience. Well done for what it is. Although I won't pay this much for a game unlock anyway.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00EL71DR2 1 1377561600 106 I am near the end of the game. I am trying to connect the fuel hose to the fuel pump before starting the plane. The hose is immediately beneath the arrow to exit the scene. It is impossible to pick up the hose. Every time I tap anywhere near the hose it throws me back to the previous scene.  I tried enlarging the scene and scrolling around but the arrow stays firmly planted on the hose. I have a kindle fire HD 7 purchased December 2012, so it is not an old one. I cannot advance. Please fix for 5 star rating. Game is great otherwise.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B008K3OOJM 4 1380672000 91 This is a fun game if you like fish. You have virtual tanks, which you can decorate and stock with fish as you like. The graphics are much better than similar games I have played. Thus far I have done fine without any in-app purchases. Note that in order to be able to convert coins (points) to and from dollars (purchased with real $) there is a one time fee of $3.99. I have gone without doing this so far. I love aquariums, so this is a great game for me.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00ENTFFZY 5 1382054400 47 This is just the type of game I love. Point and click with an engaging story plot, cool graphic video clips, a little HO (but not too much),  and long enough to really get i to it. Best one in awhile. Looking forward to the next one!
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B008X8QCTO 4 1369785600 91 I think something must have changed since some of these negative reviews were written. I was asked to unlock the bonus chapter but was not charged an additional fee. I found the game quite enjoyable. It's hard to find adventure games where you actually make decisions. So many of them are just a series of ho and puzzles where a &quot;story&quot; is basically just read to you as you go along. To me, those are not really adventure games. This is an adventure game, and comparable to some that cost more.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00JQ8TQ1G 5 1400371200 69 Engaging story. I like the cut scenes. There are a lot of HO scenes, but gratefully there is not a penalty for tapping, at least in the casual mode. There's a lot of tools to find and travel back and forth to use them, like in any point and click adventure. It is a good length for the price, including a bonus chapter and strategy guide. Recommend this one.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00ATDOVNK 5 1367539200 37 This is a great adventure with an interesting story line, plot twists, and lots of action. The graphics are detailed and it includes short clips of animation at key points. Everything you want in an adventure game.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00II5YUIW 4 1395619200 108 I enjoyed this and it held my attention throughout. The only reason I held back a star is that it was just a bit short for the price. It had both HO and mini games. I prefer just a tad lighter on both for more of a true point and click adventure, but for those who enjoy all three equally this was a good balance. It was also a good balance of tone --meaning it was neither a frightfest nor a lame kiddy game. It was family friendly and still interesting for adults. I do enjoy good cut scenes and these were present as well. Overall, well done.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00ATPVA78 1 1368144000 77 I really thought this was going to be a good one. It's just too glitchy.  Sometimes takes repeated tapping to interact with an object and it's hard to tell precisely where to place it, to get the action to take. I found myself repeatedly pressing the hint button, when I already knew exactly what to do, the game just wouldn't do it. Not worth the frustration. If this was a paid version I would be angry. Uninstalling.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B00CWG9EUM 5 1372032000 168 This is a really great game. I enjoy adventure games that are not dominated by HOS. The point-and-click story should always be primary in my opinion. This one is and it's a lot of fun. I enjoy the occasional animated clips to make the story more dramatic. What I think I appreciate most is that it is one of the incredibly rare examples of games in this genre without ghosts or witches. It is near to impossible to find a straightforward crime mystery where point-and-click dominates over HOS. The only reason my rating is not a five star is a technical issue at the end. In the final animated clip I start to see large white blocks on the screen, interfering with the picture. I tried to run the bonus chapter but most of the screen was whited-out and this made it impossible. This is on kindle fire HD.  Will increase to five-star when fixed.Update: Technical difficulties have been corrected and as promised rating increased to 5 stars.
A12TDKDT01ATU8 B004JZBGWI 5 1380326400 154 I use this for my regular shopping and errand list, as well as for gift ideas, notes on which batteries go in what watch, and so many other things. My favorite feature is the ability to draw a line through an item in the checklist without deleting it. That way if there is a grocery item I buy frequently, I can cross it off but still save it at the bottom of the list to uncross the next time I need it. It has been WONDERFUL handy since finding that I have celiac and having to note specific brand names for every item on my grocery list. That way I can cross it off, but save the item for next time I need it, and I don't have to search all over again to find which brands I can eat. This is a great app for anyone who uses lists, but especially detailed ones.
A12TFRH285SM9H B009G9KFQ0 5 1402444800 24 Kits has all I need, temps, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, LOCAL radar, and it's operation is seamless and fast...extras like a great photo gallery...
A12TFRH285SM9H B007TBAQCK 4 1362960000 26 Good slots site with a nice variety of games.  Plenty loose enough to give back some righteous payouts. I recommend this app for good mindless fun.
A12TFRH285SM9H B009VSW15Y 4 1353369600 31 Sure wish the makers of the "kindle" would include this app. with the software bunle.  Why have a camera and not be able to shot a single picture?  LIKE this app.!!!_
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B00B2TET3C 4 1360627200 67 This is  a very fun bingo app, but I have the same problem with it that I have with other free bingo apps. Unless you're ready to spend real money, only expect to play for 10 minutes a day. The latest update fixed the only other problem I had with this app, the "connect to facebook" button now works! So, I've upgraded my rating to four stars.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B007KPOZK4 4 1333065600 30 this app is a great time waster. I love building up my very own acting career, and trying to win that &quot;best actress&quot; award. the newest update is cool, too.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B007PT3QOQ 4 1333929600 102 all these gameloft social type games that only close in some convoluted way? this is supposed to be a kindle fire addition, yeah? so, tell me how I'm supposed to get out of this game easily, without going into the menu or something? where is my bottom bar with my back arrow and home key? anyway, despite that annoyance, I gave it four stars. it is fun to play, and I like the idea of continuing the Oregon Trail. loved the original in computer class in elementary school, and this would be great too, if it didn't make my tool bar dissapear.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B007NACZPI 3 1332460800 36 I like this kind a lot, and this one is better than some of them. honestly, I like the &quot;story&quot; games better, but atlwast this one hasn't asked me to add a bunch of neighbors yet.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B00CC59H8W 4 1367625600 29 And addictive! I've been playing this game constantly since I got it and My niece loves it, too! Download it, you won't be able to put it down, either.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B00846GKTW 4 1337817600 28 so far, anyway. the graphics are way better that it girl, or that other stardom game. I like that you get to dress up models, instead of yourself.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B007Q3KX42 2 1333929600 75 this would probably be one of my favorites of this type of game, but I'm now about to delete it, because it crashes when you open it. it crashes when you care for animals. it crashes when you clean up the shelter. basically, if you can get it to open at all, you'll be lucky to get 2 or 3 minutes of game play before it freezes up or closes itself. don't bother with it.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B00E8KLWB4 4 1389398400 38 This is your basic hidden object game. The levels seem to randomly switch between find by word, find by silhouette, and find by picture. Nice graphics, quests to complete. A great game to kill a mindless half hour.
A12TGOCIKTM9L7 B00A0YXZVW 5 1353196800 20 this app is super cute. great for little girls who love horses, and fun for us grown up girls, too.
A12THCL9CF5BWN B009UX2YAC 4 1358121600 21 Very addicting but lots of fun.  You can keep playing for a while and not realize how much time has passed.
A12THCL9CF5BWN B0069G5Z9K 3 1358121600 21 Fun game but my daughter does not play it as often as some of the other games.  Still a good game.
A12TK44Q3M25KO B0086700CM 5 1351641600 20 so fun I luv it. awesome game. everybody should get this app.really amazing and adventurous. definately a game for boys.
A12TK44Q3M25KO B00846GKTW 5 1362700800 30 this is an awesome game for tweens and teens. when we had to reset our kindle er were so upset because we lost all of our progress. this game rocks!
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B00B2V66VS 4 1364083200 65 This I'd a verY good gamme .  But temple run I'd more addictive I don't now why but temple run is still butter this is Good to cause it has a ziplin FREe game to Also has a min a cart  in a min plus it has butter graphics then temple run actually a parity goof games. Buy this game Perez you are so Dawson
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B0057J06HQ 5 1363996800 69 If you do not have this game, you are missing out on some serious fun.  It is a great game with many different things to throw at the office jerk.  You also don't have to purchase content in the game with real money.  The game allows you to use game money to buy different items to toss.I really like this game. It is free and a very good bargain.
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B0086700CM 5 1364083200 59 This is the best app that I have ever played in my entire life!  I have probably spent a full day on it!  It is better than lots of PAID apps.  And it's free!  If you don't have this app, you are missing out.  If I could give Temple Run 1000000000 stars I would!  You really need this game!
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B004SBS8LA 3 1363996800 23 This game is really fun but also super hard.  It is okay but not great.  I would say buy it cause it's free
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B009SDHIPK 2 1363996800 45 This is an ok app for being a free app, but it isn't very good.  I think that the movements are too herky jerky. Also it is very hard to throw and run.  Do not get this app if you already have other football apps.
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B00A42SC5E 3 1363996800 54 This is a better than average game.  The one complaint I have is that advertisements pop up before, after, and sometimes even during the game.  It is annoying and it occasionally makes me lose the game.  Please delete the ads, Backflip.  I recommend this game because it is free  and fun and pretty addicting.
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B00769WNK8 4 1363996800 132 I bought this game because it was free. I wasn't really expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This game is actually quite addicting.  It has very simple graphics, but many games with simple graphics are more fun than any games with complex graphics.  That is the case with Line Runner.  Also, I like the fact that there are not many advertisements at all.  In lots of free games you are constantly asked to buy things with real money.  Also, the game isn't fun unless you buy things.  In Line Runner, the game comes with everything.  You don't have to buy anything in the game.  The only reason why I didn't give this game five stars is because I don't believe in giving anything five stars.  I'm sort of old-fashioned that way.
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B00A1SL8SE 4 1364256000 50 Very cute little game I like it very much cause it has good music plus it is addicting and fun and it is sort of hard butt in a good way cause it's fun and keeps you playing also it had good controls also it is really a hood app
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B008Y2FRFO 1 1363996800 36 This was a very boring app.  Do not get it!  It takes way too long for coins to regenerate.  Plus, there is no action at all, just a wall pushing at coins.  This app is pointless.
A12TNTPZNPQP6C B00A3WTXQ2 1 1363996800 79 Maybe if I was 3 years old I would've liked this, but come on!  Seriously, do not buy this app. It is so childish.  Also, you can't really control the freaking red blob.  It just goes wherever it wants too.  Also, it's kinda creepy if you ask me.  It keeps smiling widely and it just sort of freaks me out.  Do not buy this app if you value your sanity, because you will go nuts if you play it.
A12TOX4JLWBW4H B00EHKJ60E 3 1401408000 21 Like this game but will not let me connect to my Facebook. Please fix and I will give you another star
A12TOX4JLWBW4H B00CWY76CC 4 1376697600 20 It's fun and entertaining. It's a puzzle in every level. It keeps you on your toes. Definitely worth the download.
A12TOX4JLWBW4H B007TBAQCK 1 1358035200 58 Now that I have a kindle fire, I downloaded some of my favorite apps from my Samsung to my kindle fire. I love the app except for one thing, I cannot connect to my facebook account. I have to start all over from the beginning and I had a boatload of coins from play. What's up with that?
A12TOZD170Q1B6 B00BJCM3S0 5 1375142400 25 Choose from many different styles of random color drawing.  You don't get to choose the color, but the fun is still inherent in the app,.
A12TOZD170Q1B6 B00GRVV29E 5 1394236800 49 I would call this therapeutic. There is zero stress in the use of this app. It's not a 'game';  it doesn't challenge us to defeat evil or to be the best at anything or penalize or run out of supplies. It leads our thoughts to larger ideas. Try it.
A12TOZD170Q1B6 B004N2NWQ0 4 1375142400 20 Yay! My son is a genius. It's tricky and its fun and the kids may do better than the adults
A12TSSMY6TXXNX B0055SWM08 5 1336003200 31 A surprisingly wonderful game that is enjoyable and calming at the same time.  I have never experienced a game like this before.  You truly owe it to yourself to try this.
A12TSSMY6TXXNX B00AK0X5VQ 5 1370131200 33 I really like this game and the replay value is quite high.  I like how it teaches is simple to learn but can also be quite complex with the physics behind the scenes.
A12TSSMY6TXXNX B008N8IV2U 4 1370131200 24 Many of the puzzles really make you think but sometimes the solution is either very obscure or requires too many steps to be reasonable.
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B008JJS6D2 3 1352419200 31 like but need more cards for more bingos and more points earned so you can move to the next state. wish the game was just a better way to play it
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B009KS4XRO 5 1360800000 33 it is one of the better bingo games that I have like it a lot. But would like to see my changes for powerups and bingos have lots of rooms to play in.
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B00A6W03Z4 3 1360800000 38 The game is hard to get the right bid and up on the stage. it is not an user friendly game. if they made it a little more real like the show it might be a better game.
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B00A4KVFLY 5 1357257600 74 I love the game on tv and my Kindle Fire but is a lot hard when you are having to write down the answers then shouting them out, But still fun to play with family and friends. Helps keep your mind sharp because you need to be fast they don't give you alot of time, the time seems shorter then it really is because you are trying to remember. So recomend this for everyone.
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B009WJNXAE 5 1360800000 51 like the game. it is one of best in the bingo's that I have. Would like to see more changes for powerups and more bingo rewards with more bingos. it is hard to see the numbers. I think they call to fast for four small cards, but the game is good
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B0098LBZPG 3 1360800000 28 the game is okay but needs more reward and powerups so you can play the game longer. the game is one of the better bingos that I have.
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B00A6GNC1M 5 1360800000 23 it is a good bingo game. But would like to see more powerups and more larger winning pots so you can play longer.
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B00AMR1HZ8 4 1360800000 45 the game is easy to play but it would be better if me the person would lose sometimes but I win ever time. the people that they use could be more like real people now weird ones. but over all it is a good game
A12TUGIFP9PZXJ B007PW1BRC 3 1338422400 26 like game but it gets tiring to have to back and forth to do each Phase and also need to see the Phases at all times.
A12U31SSP2SZLB B00HAPRVWS 5 1391126400 36 This games awesome!!!!!!! And by the way about the awesomeness but what about the 2player vs I would be really happy if they put that it's awesome!!!!.But we should be happy that we have this game
A12U31SSP2SZLB B00D74DVKM 5 1398556800 77 I found out about debug mode again just like sonic 2 really good game good game.My dad use to own a sega genesis &amp; had sonic 1 but his sister spilled a drink on itIt's awesome to play good really good plus u can play as knuckles rather then playing the hack on sonic retro and sonic retro sucks!! Why because u need a plug-in well also u can play as tails without playing the hack to
A12U31SSP2SZLB B0067VKQLE 5 1390348800 29 This is an awesome game and try sonic cdLike seriously it's flipping awesome u should really buy this awesome gameSonic the hedgehog cd is awesome too!! For sega lovers
A12U3TLNE93CTY B004U75OYG 4 1327795200 28 Works great for the Kindle Fire!!!  this game is a bit confusing at first but once you get the hang of it, it can be quite an addiction.
A12U3TLNE93CTY B006CZ4238 5 1332633600 45 I am a girl and I love it! it is very well put together and not difficult unless you are extremely used to it on wii or x-box.  I knew nothing about football and learned it in no time! great graphics and no complaints :)
A12U3TLNE93CTY B0067Q4PQQ 5 1326672000 34 wonderful game!! if you really enjoy it, if is worth getting the upgrade. if its only an okay gme to you, there is no point and you should move on to a different game.
A12U3TLNE93CTY B0066T8JRK 5 1324944000 27 This game is easy to use and is a great time killer. I play this game daily and will continue to for the life of this kindle!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B004SJ3BCI 5 1325116800 42 This game has no problems on a Kindle Fire and has very few ads.. nothing to get upset about. After all, it is the free game with advertisements! Even so, this is a game for all ages. An amazing game no doubt!!!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B007ZGO7EM 5 1357344000 26 Just like the title says, this app is amazing! Love the large buttons and that the calculator fills up the entire screen. Very easy to use
A12U3TLNE93CTY B00B2V66VS 3 1359849600 52 Every time I get to a high point in the game, the game freezes and shuts down. Therefore I don't get my high score or the coins I earned. I had 4 million with 6,000 coins that I got jipped out of.Otherwise I love this game and it is a great change!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B006D1ONE4 5 1324857600 38 While angry birds is my favorite, this game gives you hours of fun! It is very addictive, and anyone can enjoy it! A simple game played by guiding water to its proper spot. Thanks for the game Amazon!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B0086700CM 5 1338940800 26 Have been waiting so long for this game to come, and it finally did! Now all they need is Jetpack Joyride and kindle will be perfect!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B0070O973K 1 1334275200 26 In case you didn't read the description, this app wants you to make &quot;poo&quot; shiny... what is this world coming to?! This is crazy and stupid.
A12U3TLNE93CTY B007XKEY6Q 5 1335916800 24 works wonderful on a Fire. fun to put your thoughts down on [paper] and try to tell others what you are thinkinghighly recommend it!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B006HUWEHY 4 1325116800 82 The ratings people have been giving this game aren't correct. On a Kindle Fire, this game works easily and there aren't any problems getting out off it. You just have to wait until the end of the round and push the menu tab, and you can get back from there. This isn't the most entertaining game I have ever played,but it isn't a bad game.... If you don't like it, delete it off your kindle or whatever you are complaining off of.
A12U3TLNE93CTY B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366156800 25 This game is worth it, I just wish I knew more movies... a lot of fun for those who think they have seen them all
A12U3TLNE93CTY B008YU0AOE 2 1364860800 37 The calculator part is nice, but my trigonometric equations didn't come out the same as my other classmates. It is off by a good enough about that I got over half of the problems wrong. That sucks!!
A12U3TLNE93CTY B0066T8M1I 4 1325203200 49 This game is a lot of fun! There are a few issues with cut off cards in the trading place, which they really should fix, considering it is a $5 game. Even so, the game is easily playable and a lot of fun if you aren't too busy complaining!!
A12U4ASRDPWWQD B00B2V66VS 5 1388793600 84 This game is awesome. I have never had a problem with it. I would totally  recommend it. The only downfall is that it is so much better than Temple Run that I almost never play Temple Run anymore. But, Temple Run is a lot harder than Temple Run 2. If you are looking for a game that is 3D, or seems like it, is an easier game than Temple Run, and is literally the coolest game application on earth, than it is right here.
A12U4ASRDPWWQD B00AREIAI8 5 1393891200 51 This is an awesome app. If you like horses then you will love this game. I like horses but I am not a fanatic that has seventeen horse posters on my wall although I still love this game. Good graphics, great sounds. You can do lots of stuff with your horse.
A12U4ASRDPWWQD B006MH1A1S 5 1362700800 43 This game rocks!!!!! Nothing bad about it except that you only have three levels for free and then you either play the same levels over and over until you buy the real game. In the real game there is hundreds of levels, though.
A12U4ASRDPWWQD B008ZOHCKE 5 1401235200 24 Notebooks&reg; is a great app. It is awesome for those who are writing books, and need something to write it all down on. Awesome=)
A12U4ASRDPWWQD B00CZDSK7K 3 1393804800 83 Great game. It is a game that you can't play for hours on end though. The only reason I give it three stars is because  sometimes when I try to load it it just gives me a black screen. I tried playing different games and then coming back, reinstalling it, turning off and shutting down my kindle fire but none of it works. I somehow get back though. Probably a unique problem so don't let this so you from buying this free game.
A12U5UUHP4UVI7 B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384560000 106 This game is so much fun to do and play hockey league and the same thing with a Twitter account of the cliff at the same time for birthday parry and I don't know how much best of all night night time for the concrete and play best game I don't know if it is raining and the free encyclopedia safety of the concrete examples of all the same I am back to do the same time as well want to see you are welcome the concrete and you are not coming to the same I don't think she does tell me best game ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!
A12U5UUHP4UVI7 B00CEVALHA 5 1386547200 68 This is the best game ever since the beginning of the best game ever. I play this game 24/7. All of the little buildings are so cool!!! Happy world park is a very fun game it is even more better than a fun game. it is even free. My sister can play it to she love's this game soooooo much!!!!!!!! I love zebras, dogs, and all other animals.
A12U6CX0KUGR8T B00CKW6FVE 4 1385251200 57 l have always been fan of tetris.  I like this one even more just games are short.  my only complaint would be that I got all the way up to level 16 and then the game wouldn't work anymore.  I uninstalled it and installed and now it works fine but I had to start at level one.
A12U6CX0KUGR8T B007T8BYWE 4 1389830400 24 I like these puzzles because they challenge the brain but yet are easy enough for anyone to enjoy.  The picture are fun to uncover.
A12U6CX0KUGR8T B008Y212PI 4 1381795200 30 I like the pictures.  It flexed my brain but is still simple. I have only tried 5 by 5.  Glad it was free. I would not pay for this app.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00HY9UK28 5 1392076800 32 This game is for the people who love music. Unlike some of the other games like this,this one does not time you to earn points. I think that is the real kicker.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00A8ECU24 5 1358294400 26 Goes along with the story line very well. I enjoy it a lot. Even though my parent thinks it's weird. I play it all the time.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00BS3UFCQ 5 1365984000 21 Just started playing. Awsome game. Some of the movies were hard to guess, but that is okay. Would recomend playing it.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00D1DL0IE 5 1379030400 25 This game is awesome! Graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth and dependable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes these kinds of games.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00E5GJ7QS 5 1376956800 50 Best bingo game so far! And I play a lot of bingo! Graphics are nice, voices are not annoying (that is a big one for me) a lot of ways to earn bingo bills. Overall it is one of the best bingo games I have played in a long time.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00EZWPFW2 5 1380153600 27 Fun game. Gives your brain a nice workout. It is actually harder than it looks. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to work out riddles
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00I8Q77Y0 5 1397606400 28 You must get this... now. It...is...amazing. It is very addictive, it will give many different emotions, you will feel like you are gonna blow up. Just get it.
A12U9PVRUGZL3C B00D3MWW44 5 1373760000 41 This game is amazing !!! I had so much fun with it. I am 16 and this was a lot of fun. I would recommend having more levels,and different music to choose from. But other than that the game is great.
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B009HKL4B8 5 1369094400 27 one of the best games out there love it and would recommend it to anyone. if you like the sims then you would like this free one
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B007XKEY6Q 5 1369094400 31 this game is a fun way to pass the time and to draw no matter if you stink or not no one judges you they may laugh but its all fun
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B009RAQGLG 5 1369094400 35 love love this game me and my daughter plaied this game manytimes its a game that you can play alone or for family all ages can play. i wish they had more games for it.
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B0064X7B4A 4 1369094400 30 i like this game even though no one really plays it that often anymore but its a great game and i would love to add more people that play it
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B005V1N71W 5 1369094400 24 you can listen to anything you want and the related bands that you never heard to open your horizons to new and better music
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B00BJQKQH6 3 1369094400 20 i liked this game its graphics where good and the game play was not to easy to get used to.
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B007VT07QU 4 1369094400 24 i love love this game and wish there was more to it. it says to be continued i cant wait till they contiune it.
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B007N85POS 4 1369094400 22 its a fun game that gets hard at sometimes but is a great way to challenge you and the way you think.
A12UCPKZQM0UXS B008XG1X18 5 1369094400 24 pinterest is awsome so many great ideas and pics that you can pick from who ever came out with this is a genious. :D
A12UE00VH7D20N B007693VXG 1 1338336000 29 you pop pimples eww[...] all of the yellow pus comes out and it gross.listen to these ratings. don't get it. unless you want have pimple nightmares. stupid dumb pathetic.
A12UE00VH7D20N B007V2UGPE 5 1338422400 80 this game rocks! I love it. you get to fight zombies and protect your village, and after you beat s certain amount of levels you get new allies and new moves like legarthy (it makes the zombies slow down) and diverse (you can summon allies but sometimesbyou sword turns into a chicken if this move is used incorrectly. you also can level up you hero and his sword and stuff.Ps. in this game you use fake money to buy stuff.
A12UE00VH7D20N B00D2K40WY 5 1372723200 35 come ova and read this! its like real life! I wish I was a princess in real life!!! I just wish you didn't have to buy the whole version. but or else... best game ever.
A12UE00VH7D20N B007JYI4SU 5 1338336000 34 this game is great! I love it. it actually got my mood right!if you like fun games get it!!!!!!!!!!!plus it's free. it's so fun to try it on your friends. listen to these ratings!!!
A12UGA5KEMCT36 B005SJTLUS 5 1322524800 27 To concerned by what this game could actually be. I don't blame Amazon though. It's free. Take it if you want it. if you don't, say why.
A12UGA5KEMCT36 B004S33RRI 5 1303171200 26 Hard to know who's being honest here.  Good thing this list maker is FREE today so folks can ignore this nonsense &amp; test it out THEMSELVES!
A12UGA5KEMCT36 B004VOJT0I 3 1309046400 29 ...for most folks at least. I was really disappointed to get so many meat dishes when selecting veggie.  It seems like a nifty app; but I need veggie options.
A12UGA5KEMCT36 B004HIGDV6 1 1304380800 25 Not for SGS Vibrant. FC - just like everyone said it would. Bummer. (Bi-Winning)FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC FC
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B005HK1JFS 1 1326499200 35 pros:nonenonezipzilchnarratecons:a complete rip off of fruit ninjasdisgusting graphicsno customizabality whatsoevertoo hard to get to home screenplus 1 star for the 2 game modes, but they don't work wella waste of space, not worth your time/money
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B004RJMUJO 5 1326499200 83 the paid version is great, but I am going to list the pros and (very few)  cons.pros:no adsgood unlocksvery addictivewho doesn't like to cut up an endless gauntlet of fruit!!??cons:some (minor)  lag spells, mostly during instillations and updates on the kindlesome acheivements are hard to get and might frustrate youthey make you join feint, because without it you see hints that without feint, the game is &quot;worthless &quot;other than those few cons, this app is fantastic and deserves 5 out of 5 stars
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B004J1DBJI 3 1337990400 26 when I saw this app, I was very excited. I had heard great things about it. I bought it but it won't download now...why wolfram? why?
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B007TKT2SK 4 1359849600 52 This app is a very useful fraction calculator, certainly. There is nothing wrong with what it offers, but rather the fact there is no decimal conversion option. Overall though, as long as you can remember every decimal conversion, than there is no issue. Hopefully, the developer will put in this option soon.
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B007JPG04E 4 1332115200 20 it gets tricky in some maps and they bribe reviewers. worth 4 stars. totally amazing. love it. try it now.
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B007MNV5WU 5 1332374400 30 I love this game!! they've done a great job incorporating the birds, eggs, pigs, and so much more! I love the new invention for the yellow bird! great job rovio!
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B00A8ECU24 3 1354233600 108 When Gameloft released the MLP app, there were mixed reactions, especially after they confirmed it would be a Sims-like game. Sadly, the reactions are partially true.The good:1. Graphics are amazing2. a lot to work for in the game in terms of unlocking stuff.3. many &quot;Brony&quot; shoutouts are madeThe bad:Social connectivity is required to earn one form of currencySomewhat laggy on KFsound options are glitchy (such as mute)The ugly:the need for IAP's becomes excessive after only a couple hours of playing (level 11, about), which is.frustrating.overall: Worth getting if you like games such as the Sims, but will take a lllooonnnggg time if you want to finish playing free.
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B0086700CM 5 1339286400 63 my brothers have ipods while I have a kindle. as a result, I missed out on treasure like this.along with that, I was constantly hearing: I just bought (put name here). I was getting severely irked.enough about me! the game definatly lived up to the hype. its replay value is the key, and it was fantastic. the graphics are amazing too!5 stars deserved!
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B004SCG69A 5 1327795200 26 a great game. it acts more like a normal video game than an app and works flawlessly on my kindle. it is fun, challenging, and addicting.
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B0055SWM08 5 1327190400 39 of all the games I have on my kindle fire, no game really duplicates the simplicity, sophistication, and challenge like quell does. it is an enjoyable game that can become very addicting if you let yourself become addicted.5 stars!
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B004UID2LC 4 1337299200 39 for kindle. it does work well. it does unexpectedly crash and it is harder to find youtube channels. you have to know the name/keywords of the video you want. also, download it as video unless you want the visual.
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B008KMAJQU 4 1347408000 94 I had seen this game on ninjakiwi.com, so I thought this would be a tower defense like the computer version. Boy was I wrong! This works like a TPS (third person shooter) with placable sentries. They found a clever to make the ads somewhat unobtrusive,  and it is challenging, but not impossible to upgrade stuff. The only reason it is 4 stars for me is because of the somewhat annoying controls, and small amount of maps. We need aggressive expansion for maps, but it's a pretty good game nonetheless! At least worth a try.
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B0054JZC6E 1 1326499200 24 the controls are horrible for gameplay, it can get really glitchy, and so many ads pop up it's crazy.not worth your memory and time
A12UGGGHFIQX2M B007C7UZIG 4 1373932800 94 The Steam app is, for the most part, great. You can get games, update (parts) of your profile, and change security/account settings, all on the go. The problem is, there is no community tab. That means you cannot go to the forums, community markets, or workshop. Along with that, anything related to community (trading cards, profile backgrounds, etc...) cannot be accessed. This app works fine for most stuff, but since it is incomplete i took off a star. If you have a steam account and a mobile device, you need to get this app.
A12UGRTEGIZWVO B00BHEUT0E 5 1370822400 21 I have played this as a car d game for years, and now enjoy playing it on my Kindle Fire HD
A12UGRTEGIZWVO B00820STKI 5 1376784000 20 Great hand/eye fun fast game...thanks for making it available on the Kindle Fire HD ...anymore like it?  This is great
A12UHQXPASZF0D B00D3MWW44 5 1377820800 41 This game is awesome! I love  it because you can choose  different outfits for your dolphin an  even turn it into a mermaids or frog! This game  is for ages 1 to 100000! Little kids will lib  this even adults to!
A12UHQXPASZF0D B00CO52NLI 5 1403308800 185 As a mother it is very hard to find a app both my daughter's enjoy. One daughter is ruff and likes shooting games and the other is very sweet and insists that the other daughter stops killing bugs and insects outside. I found this an  thought how cute! I downloaded it and my daughter's tried it. At first they were stuck and couldn't find out how to get the brush for the bunny. I tried as well and so did my husband but we couldn't do it. I deleted it. The girls were sad and wanted the game back so one night they snatched my phone and got the app back. The next morning I found them once again struggling to find the brush. It's a cute game but we just need help finding the brush  for the bunny. Overall it's a cute game to play with the birds and ponies I got and they play together which is everything a mom needs. It leaves me a lot of free time which is great. Thank you whoever made this app. It brought my daughter's together!!
A12UIUPEGCSOYJ B00ANT4OHS 3 1360368000 108 This game is a great time killer and extremely fun, but it freezes alot and stutters while playing especially while you're jumping.  The worst part though is that half the time I will get really far, leave the game, then come back to play only to find out that all of what I did is erased.  I am playing on a K Fire and have played much more intense and in depth games with zero issues.  This game is awesome but all these things hold it back, the developers need to fix these quirks.  I would have given it more stars but held it back for those reasons.
A12UIUPEGCSOYJ B00BMH4GQE 3 1369094400 39 it is what is says.  it is the same as the rest alot of the words are the same with similar clues.  if you played one you will know some of the answers right away good time killer though.
A12UIUPEGCSOYJ B00C6RHC1A 3 1369008000 33 it is a good time killer.  just another guess the word based on 4 pics.  some of them make you think outside the box though and some are same answers from other games.
A12UIUPEGCSOYJ B00BG3ID0Y 3 1368921600 25 its you typical pic word game.  guess what word applies the the four pics using a jumble of letters.  it is a good time waster.
A12UL82C20SCG3 B0064TVQ5E 5 1360713600 19 Something fun to do during the day.Graphics are colorful and great, I enjoy it.Keeps your mind active and alert.
A12UMS07QIL0C0 B004MC8CA2 5 1369267200 26 I absolutely LOVE this app!  I highly recommend everyone that want's to read and get to know our precious Lord to get it and study it........
A12UNCALEVM84P B005VS7A1I 5 1369180800 21 Can not say enough good things about it. Love it, easy to use, easy to read, and works fine...Thank you, George;
A12UNCALEVM84P B005HSL626 5 1366416000 21 This one has been around a while, and needs to have something added to it to change it up a little..GEORGE;
A12UNCALEVM84P B0066W1AZK 5 1366416000 32 This is good to fine tune your chess skills, and just to play a game at your level, or set the settings to difficult, and get your butt kicked by a Kindle...George;
A12UNCALEVM84P B00B5DLSMU 5 1366416000 21 This is what the kids need to play on, they have to use critical thinking to win, great idea...Thank you, George;.
A12UNCALEVM84P B004W7Z14W 5 1366416000 25 Another app that is simple and just what you need, not a bunch of junk on there that you will never use. Thank you George;
A12UNCALEVM84P B004GMJKTK 1 1369180800 37 I would not recommend this product to any one it was the worst app I have ever tried to use. It would freeze, or stop and e few minutes later would work on and off...Thank you George;
A12UNWZN1O0SV0 B00A04F8NU 5 1355788800 25 Good for kids and adults with too much time on their hands. You can make it harder or easier depending on your ability and eyesight.
A12UNWZN1O0SV0 B004GVYXTS 5 1362182400 28 Challenging in single player mode. A fun way to spend time waiting for a table or for the show to start in either single or two player mode.
A12UNWZN1O0SV0 B008L3T37O 4 1347062400 60 Pretty pictures of fairies surrounded by hidden objects- some more difficult to find than others. You can choose to search by name, silhouette, or picture, timed or not- I appreciate the options as I just want to be pleasantly entertained, not stressed by a ticking clock. No story line at all- and the pictures repeat each time you go through.
A12UNWZN1O0SV0 B0080SC22I 3 1347062400 34 Too often the objects are &quot;almost&quot; off screen and difficult to see. At least you can choose to play without a timer so you can spend a lot of time looking without being penalized.
A12UNWZN1O0SV0 B00846FBEM 4 1343606400 36 hidden object game with penalties for random taps. interesting, but it would be better if you could zoom in. my eyesight isn't up to some of the more detailed scenes. but so far I'm enjoying this
A12UOUSM6J4TW0 B007JPG04E 5 1332028800 21 fun game really like it takes a little bit to load but not as much as other glu. games like it
A12UOUSM6J4TW0 B00GTCECVG 1 1388534400 46 When I first got the game I loved, then one time I tried to log on it would just crash, I've tried everything but it will only be running for a second before it crashes, I've been trying all day for it to work, please help.
A12UOUSM6J4TW0 B00ATU5JRA 1 1361404800 40 its fake, it makes you download other apps and then gives you 3 networks to hack into, but it didn't even give me my network to hack into, to save your self some time the passwords are, jaguar, beach, iceman
A12UOUSM6J4TW0 B00B2V66VS 2 1358985600 34 the game was great but the day after I got it, when ever I try to open the app it crashes, I have truer to re open it several times but it wont work
A12UQAE8850R36 B00D0VZLVE 5 1370822400 25 This game is very addictive. I like word games, so this is right up my alley. Love all these picture and word games...Keep them coming.
A12UQAE8850R36 B004HGK6FW 5 1374192000 21 Love the game. Love the button layout. Great job. Happy this app is free. Keep it up. Yeah. Wonderful. Woot woot.
A12UQAE8850R36 B00CAW96DI 5 1368662400 23 This game is a lot of fun. It really makes you think. I like word games, so this game really appeals to me.
A12UQAE8850R36 B00BX736EG 5 1368316800 21 Awesome for the very most average family. We love it. Great for the brain. It makes you really think. Get it.
A12UQAE8850R36 B00F24OV8G 5 1382054400 23 Logos scrambled...Great combination. I really like that you have ten chances to scramble the picture if you are stuck. It's a great game.
A12UQAE8850R36 B00BJSJKJ4 5 1371081600 28 I utterly enjoyable games. They are the best. Boggle was my favorite childhood game and Kindle is my favorite adulthood device, so having both together is just great.
A12URPPU17AF7F B00B2V66VS 3 1386806400 25 Like u can maybe add a grabbing hook to the shop or a jet pack cause  the game does not have a lot of things
A12URPPU17AF7F B00BWA8BAS 3 1388707200 21 For one thing is there should be a daily spin and there should be a thing we're u canChange the person
A12URPPU17AF7F B00992CF6W 4 1388966400 91 If you don't know about buying it you should because you can join your brothers world which is awesome or even other people who have to by that you can make new friends it's just like the pc and Xbox but different control's if you don't like the control's at first  you should build some stuff to get used to the control's then it might be ok for u that always have new updates so don't get mad when the update doe not come out yet just wait it helps alot
A12UTTE80IPQB2 B00A8ECU24 3 1369526400 45 I downloaded this game for my girls (4,6).  It took a little time to figure the game out and then they weren't that impressed.  They played it a while because they love My Little Ponies, but the fun was not there to hold them in.
A12UTTE80IPQB2 B00BWBHIUG 3 1369526400 30 This game is not quite what we had in mind.  We ended up deleting it shortly after downloading it.  My girls, ages 4 and 6 were not that into it.
A12UTTE80IPQB2 B00AECGQF2 5 1369526400 29 All three of my kids love this game.  They enjoy every aspect from cutting, to coloring to shampooing and blow drying the character's hair.  Lots of simple, clean, fun.
A12UTTE80IPQB2 B00B2V66VS 4 1369526400 21 This version is similar to the original Temple Run.  My kids enjoy it and now prefer it over the first version.
A12UVNB82SFYUM B00CSR2J9I 2 1370736000 25 it was aaahhhhhh... okay I wouldent really prefer getting this app expessily if it costs you money it was really dumb and boring.....don't download it.....
A12UVNB82SFYUM B009C7JS14 1 1391212800 31 This application does not give accurate weather for my area. It is very hard to navigate. I would not reccommend it unless you live in a large city that is noteworthy.
A12UY65D3STDLB B00GOZQ2E8 5 1395878400 36 The game is more fun than I thought it would be and is addicting. Kinda reminds me of Farmville. I have a few friends who I am telling about this game cause they will love it.
A12UY65D3STDLB B006ID7U4C 4 1362960000 22 Was exactly what I wanted and for FREE! I loved it and I shared it with my family they loved it too.
A12UY65D3STDLB B00FEMJF6O 4 1402272000 44 I loved castleville game. This one is almost the same. I play it at work to pass the time since I work overnights. I still don't want to pay any money so it can be slow going but it is also fun..... so far.
A12V07M64OC0UT B00A3LSW7Y 5 1369008000 43 I enjoy this game. The quotes are nice. It has enough hard and easy puzzles to keep one occupied for a long time.  I do wish there was a hint bar - but that doesn't keep me from giving my brain a workout.
A12V07M64OC0UT B0067Q4RCI 2 1326240000 28 I love hidden object games. But they hid some of the objects behind game icons and menus! I can't click on the objects to finish the level. Frustrating!
A12V07M64OC0UT B0069G5Z9K 5 1387065600 29 While I have played this game a few moments, it is one that my kids keep coming back to. They love it. It is even entertaining for my 4-year-old!
A12V07M64OC0UT B00DJFIMW6 2 1373414400 22 Because of the good reviews, I wanted to like this game. It never did quite download on my Kindle Fire. Tablet froze.
A12V07M64OC0UT B00CGNYDIE 4 1386115200 29 This game is good. It works just as it says, and has a good tutorial to get you started. I would recommend this game if you want a challenge.
A12V07M64OC0UT B006GWE5PM 5 1328400000 23 love it! fun and challenging. works great on my kindle fire. wish you could do multiple players, but that doesn't affect my opinion.
A12V07M64OC0UT B006RA13BW 5 1333411200 27 This is a cute app. Kept my 2 and 5 year old busy for a while. It's fun if you don't want to play a competitive game.
A12V07M64OC0UT B004N371CK 5 1328227200 36 This is full screen on my Fire and is fun! I am not a big football fan, but I had a good time playing this game. My husband will enjoy it even more. Good free app!
A12V07M64OC0UT B00D6SBOWG 2 1375315200 34 I am sure I've played this game before, so I was excited to download it today. It took a LONG time to download. Now the game will not open on my Kindle Fire. :-(
A12V07M64OC0UT B0094BB4TW 5 1369958400 24 It's facebook! What else is there to say? It works great on my kindle fire, and I love the quick access it gives me.
A12V07M64OC0UT B005V1N71W 5 1370131200 28 I'm just learning the great thing about Pandora. It's wonderful to type in an artist, and hear more music of the same genre. Definitely an app worth keeping!
A12V07M64OC0UT B00DDZM0GQ 3 1377129600 30 I love, love, love this game! But once I get to level 23, the game will not load. If they fix this problem, I'd gladly give the game five stars.
A12V07M64OC0UT B00FGFVMGA 1 1386115200 41 I was excited to get this game because of the good reviews. However, I was disappointed. The game just starts. Bam! No tutorial or objective was given. I don't even know what to do, or how to navigate.  I deleted it.
A12V07M64OC0UT B00768WTXA 5 1368921600 29 I enjoy this little game. It is nice to see the levels up front, and though there aren't a lot of them, they are enjoyable to play. Good job!
A12V07M64OC0UT B00CWY76CC 5 1371600000 36 Loved this short game! It was easy enough, yet hard enough to give my brain a work out. Played with my 9-year-old son and he was disappointed when the game was over. More levels, please!  :-)
A12V07M64OC0UT B0064X7B4A 5 1365120000 22 Love playing this game with friends. It's a great way to keep in touch and challenge your mind at the same time.
A12V07M64OC0UT B005HSL626 5 1370131200 25 I love this app. Even my three-year-old can play it. It works great on my kindle fire. It's a good game and runs without bugs.
A12V07M64OC0UT B007PTJOV0 5 1364774400 23 This is a fun game, remeniscent of Mario Bros. Everyone in the household enjoys it, including the adults! You won't regret this purchase.
A12V07M64OC0UT B00EEDJHXA 5 1388016000 22 I enjoy this game. It is easy enough to complete the puzzles, but challenging as well. I definitely give it 5 stars!
A12V0FRS3UWF2I B009E8VZIK 1 1359763200 25 didn't like - deleted from kindle...  directions weren't specific enough for me to be able to figure it out - was easier to delete ..
A12V0FRS3UWF2I B0063IH60K 5 1359763200 20 played as a  kid with real cards - I like that there are several versions to play... is all good...
A12V0FRS3UWF2I B004MC8CA2 4 1359763200 33 like this - a little difficult to figure out in itially.. the down fall is that with a kindle, ya need internet to use it and that isn't always available...  like ti though...
A12V0P7QIM2MZY B0064TVQ5E 4 1356912000 31 My grandchildren and I really enjoy this. The only problem is that it is not clear which tiles are playable. I try to make generalizations and they are not always consistent.
A12V0P7QIM2MZY B00BGAZYLI 3 1366848000 54 This is a word game with a layout and scoring similar to scrabble. You can play on line or against yourself. I like it but there is a popup ad after EVERY move which is very irritating. If this is what free games mean I am willing to pay for an ad free game.
A12V0P7QIM2MZY B00640UICA 4 1378339200 58 A free game from Amazon which is fairly simple to play but has progressively more difficult levels. The cute little creatures have one of more hands, and frowns turn to smiles when you link the hands. Game over when there are no free hands. I like the non-violent aspect of it. Not as challenging as Mah Jong  however.
A12V0P7QIM2MZY B00CHSPB8Y 2 1373500800 23 It didn't work. Got it for my grandkids who like such characters. No explanation for its failure ever appeared so I trashed it.
A12V1QJ9K0MVCS B00632HWOG 2 1355875200 42 Yahoo! Mail has worked great for me for years. I just did the update on my Kindle Fire a few days ago, and now it force closes EVERY time I open it and try to perform any sort of action. Absolutely ridiculous.
A12V27O6LXANWX B00GOZQ2E8 5 1394150400 29 So far I really enjoyed, beautiful graphics, comic characters, and a interesting story.This is a well made game, doesn't crash at any time and its a lot of fun.
A12V27O6LXANWX B00EQ0CKRQ 5 1400112000 29 I really like this game, and the best part are the limit time challenges, those are great, I invest 3 dollar's to support the game Developers, they eat too.
A12V27O6LXANWX B005XQLBU4 5 1377302400 20 I really likedI play this game 15 years ago and I still enjoying this asome game! Thanks for bringing bqckA!
A12V2OKCB28RP4 B0089BPEZS 1 1399939200 20 This app does not work in my country is that bad, i love HBO but can't use it, bad luck
A12V2OKCB28RP4 B007K8RFJ4 3 1399939200 20 I do not understand this app I would like to know more install in my kinddle but do not understand
A12V68T7KHEPJ7 B0062QUNHG 4 1374710400 22 Very handy to read, have always liked it down to earth stories bible verses to go with it! Helps for daily lives!
A12V68T7KHEPJ7 B005HFNA4Q 5 1374710400 22 Love getting a uplifting verse for the day would recommend it to anyone who is wanting a good verse for the day!
A12V68T7KHEPJ7 B004MC8CA2 5 1374710400 20 It is so handy for reading for anyone retired or busy easy to find and helps along with Daily bread.
A12V68T7KHEPJ7 B005CRCP36 5 1374710400 21 Recommended for any one a verse for the day both psalms and proverbs are good promises for daily help,++and so handy!
A12V6DVVQ6112W B007JPG04E 4 1332201600 32 Great game. works great on kindle fire. only downside is that they want you to purchase guns,, ammo to continue on with missions and have a chance to win. otherwise good game.
A12V7WH9BA8575 B00IEBE7GK 5 1397952000 23 This is such a fun creepy game I enjoyed the first and.the second I highly recommend buying the room and the room 2.
A12V7WH9BA8575 B00H0BGCJK 5 1386547200 21 This game is awesome I love the Philemon style. But also the minecraft building style it's the best of both worlds.
A12V7WH9BA8575 B009HN0V6E 5 1369008000 19 You should get this and app it isdefinitely for people who love to make epic creations in minecraft pe
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B00CELIPL4 3 1385164800 26 Excellent app, except some things are way too hard to see because of the screen size, hence the hidden object title, lol. Otherwise great time passer
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B009KS4XRO 5 1385164800 74 Don't download this game unless you have the time to devote to it because it is addicting to say the least. Thought it would be a little time waster and fun, but you cant seem to stop playing, just waiting on that last number you need. Nice way to make friends also, but would like to have an in-game link to add friends without having to do the external FBook search to add friends.
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B004SH9JSU 1 1370563200 27 Want a good poker app?  D/L this one; World Series of Poker (Kindle Tablet Edition). Much better and no hassles for money, play for free and enjoy.
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B008NCUFYS 4 1385164800 28 Fun game, just hate all the pop up ads all the time, would prefer they pop up at launch or sign off and not constantly during the game.
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B004JKCMGM 5 1370563200 35 Probably the best app Ive seen for word mix type puzzles. Some of the words are unique to say the least but they do have a convenient click feature to define the word you missed.
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B008DYK0I2 5 1385164800 22 You want scores and info, they have it. Quick updates and love the favorite tems section to set up your own teams
A12V7Y1BAGLCHY B005V1N71W 5 1370563200 23 Greatest app for music ever, any artist or genre available for your listening pleasure. Skip the monthly charge and enjoy with occasional ads.
A12V8ZHFVZJL8Y B004SJ3BCI 1 1353715200 22 This app is just plain boring all you do is kill pigs(disappointed).What is the point of this app???DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!
A12V8ZHFVZJL8Y B00846GKTW 4 1373155200 88 I think this app is great. In this game you  get a person who wants to be styled In a certain way. The graphics are pretty good too. It does get to be a challenge though. For example when I tried to style someone bohomian it just said&quot;disaster&quot; it says it a lot so it can be hard. It also includes energy so you only can play for so long unless you buy an energy drink. But if you are into fashion you definitely should get this game.
A12V8ZHFVZJL8Y B00C787O48 1 1365552000 38 All they did was copy Cut The Rope. Exept they threw in a dinosaur and bad graphics. And the little monster is super cute in Cut The Rope anyway. Don't get this app instead get cut the rope!
A12V8ZHFVZJL8Y B00992CF6W 4 1362009600 33 I like this game its like the Xbox version but easier to use.But this app really needs more upgrades like water and lava buckets.It is very pricey but otherwise that I love it.
A12V8ZHFVZJL8Y B007VT07QU 5 1355097600 25 OMG I love this app sooo worth $6.00 I just want island castaway2 at the end it says&quot; to be continued&quot; otherwise I like it!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B0097HTPE4 5 1351900800 61 Easier at the beginning and gradually gets more difficult as you go along. Don't assume that the answers they are looking for are the &quot;obvious&quot; choices.  Think &quot;outside the box&quot; when it's not obvious - and you will do just fine. I am really enjoying the fun and challenge of this game! It's just the perfect balance without being too hard!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00E5GJ7QS 2 1384041600 47 I'm tired of apps that demand un-necessary access to facebook accounts in order to play them! There is absolutely no legitimate reason any game truly needs access to anyone's facebook account...period! If they Really wanted to share a &quot;free&quot; game they can do so without using facebook.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B0087SGWI6 5 1365465600 122 I'm noticing improvements and enjoying myself at the same time, you can't beat that. You do a wide variety of things from memory to math, scenery and so on. But in ways that yo don't expect. You work your way up gradually, so that you don't get frustrated or feel like you are not accomplishing anything. You pick the category you want to do. But for the best results you really should pick each category and keep trying to do your best. Don't just pick what you're comfortable with, that does not help you, it doesn't challenge you. Try it and try to do what I suggested and I bet you will like it too, after you give it a real chance.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B008N8IV2U 2 1365465600 26 Why does it seem, that so many games get so hard so fast? This is one of those games. It's hard to find games that don't.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00AQ5A88S 5 1364515200 64 Great fun!! Easy to play &amp; learn. To earn coins when you're low just leave the game running in the background when you leave your kindle to shut itself down. That's the trick let your Kindle shut down with the game running and you will collect a coin every 1/2 hr or hr.  Then you have a bank built up for later. Have fun!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B008Y2FRFO 5 1365465600 25 I really like this dozer game. It's relaxing yet a challenge at the same time. It's fun to play along with their Holiday dozer game.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00BFUC8RC 5 1362960000 44 So fun to play! Gets harder gradually in a way that makes it possible to actually play the game and enjoy it yet not get bored at all! I can't stop playing this game while I'm in bed at night! Insomniacs will love this...lol
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00768WTXA 5 1360108800 136 Easy to play and pass the time. Scenery is the best! You can choose between 4 music selections. I keep the music low as it repeats a short music track over and over. Though it is pleasant. You search for a set number animals in each scene as you go along. It may be butterflies, rabbits, birds etc. The game will display the number of animals you need to find in each scene and what kind of animal it is you're looking for. It gets harder as you go, But not so hard that you want to quit and give up. At least as far as I can tell so far. I'm not an expert type player either! Try the game if you're looking for a nice game to relax with. It's great for kids too.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00DJK2TO8 5 1374796800 50 This game is such a blast! Easy to learn and immediately you want to play the next level too. Then just as you think you've mastered the game the next level makes you think for a moment or so. Not too hard or too easy just a really fun game!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B006M4F67A 5 1368662400 84 Easy to see and separate tile designs helps to make this a very pleasant and enjoyable game to play. It also has 20 or 80 plus tile layout board designs to select from. You can start with the "Classic" layout or pick one of the many  traditional or more imaginative layouts. There's plenty here to keep you entertained or challenged if you prefer that. It even gives you hints tHat you can use or ignore if you decide too. There's so much to enjoy!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B004HE5TAG 5 1365465600 58 If you watch your bets you can keep playing for free. I don't know what happens if you run out of money. This game does have an option to buy real cash, so be careful. That's why you don't want to run out of money. So far I've been playing for over a month or so for free.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00ALKKM98 5 1360108800 82 This is so much fun. You have to connect all of the like colored dots while also filling in the entire background at the same time. You can't cross your lines except at at bridge. You have a set number of moves to complete each level for the best score. It really isn't too hard. You just need to think for a moment or two as you go along. At least in the higher levels. I think you will enjoy this game.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00EWK8N8A 5 1379116800 81 Fun and easy to learn. Yet not at all boring or too easy. The challenge is to connect the wires (pipes) as quickly as possible and correctly. You change the direction of each item simply by tapping on it. It's all very simple to play really. The challenge is to do it as quickly as you can &amp; get it done correctly. You can improve your score by tapping on the &quot;repeat&quot; button&quot;.Have fun and enjoy the game. It's a blast!!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B006OOHVVC 2 1365465600 38 I've tried to do this but it's just to hard for me to do. Either I don't have the patience or it's just too hard, I can't decide to be honest. I think I don't have the patience.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B008BK5HJK 3 1365465600 27 Like so many games, it's just too hard to play right from the very beginning. I wanted to like it but just couldn't for that reason alone.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B0063IH60K 5 1367712000 95 I love this game of Solitaire! You can choose a left or right hand lay out. You can choose your backgrounds and card designs as well. As you play, if you need to change your mind about a move you can do so. so easily without a penalty of any kind. You can also get hints to see if. there are any moves possible that you can't seem to find. Including using cards from the &quot;build on Aces stacks&quot;; anything that will help you to continue on. Hopefully on to a successfully completed Solitaire game.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B007AL48UK 5 1393027200 63 The most reliable and relaxing Mahjong games around.  But why are there so many similar versions of the same game by the same company? The original version simply called 24/7 Mahjong is the same game but with different art work on the tiles. At least I picked up the Summer and Winter versions (each) for free simply for the variety of art work.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B0071PARPA 5 1333670400 145 Take just a few minutes to read the directions and practice using different &quot;brush&quot; sizes; and you will be very happy. The brush strokes are more round like round swirls that tolls your stylus movements. Take that into consideration when you &quot;paint&quot;. You will probably want a smaller stylus size unless you are working on a large background area. To get the &quot;tools&quot;to appear simply tap on the very bottom edge of the screen. All of the &quot;tools&quot; will be displayed across the bottom of the screen and down the ride side.This should help you get started enjoying this App as much as I do. So far I have only worked on shading backgrounds and getting the framework of my painting ready. You can save each piece that you are working on too. This is such an easy to use and adjust to your needs!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00CWY76CC 5 1372550400 123 A rare treat to find a game that gradually increases the ttdifficulty level while still remaining truly fun andinteresting to play.  I just have to remember to pay attention to everything I see ina room. I can go back andLook at a particular item over and over again to double check if I have the correct let's say color order in thatmoment it's needed. I haven't run across anything yet that I couldn't solve simply by paying more attention to thedetails and double checking things if needed.A real great game that's relaxing and a real pleasure to play!What am I missing on Lvl 5? I can only get about half of the Lvov done.  Any help souled be appreciated!! Thanks so very much!!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00BJSJKJ4 5 1375747200 104 What a treat this is to play! The words can be as simple or as complex as you can make them. It's all up to you and your abilities. You aren't judged simply scored on the value of the words you've made in the time allowed. If you like word games you'll enjoy playing this game too.You simply connect the letters in the grid to form words as quickly as you can. It's that simple! Then after the alloyed time you &quot;shake up&quot; the letters in the grid again and start all over again to form as many new words as you can.Have fun!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B009EEFTMC 5 1360886400 88 You play the game just as it says to. The game is so simple to play. You select matching cubes among the cubes that make up the body of the game you are playing. You can select cubes from any side that matches another any where else at all. They are not hard to find matches. It's simply addirctive. It gets more challenging as you go but not so much that you don't want to play. I give up rather easily compared to most adults. If that helps.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B008XG1X18 5 1349568000 40 I really enjoy Pinterest for Aneroid. Although a few features are missing I still enjoy it. I'd like to be able to choose the catergory I'm viewing like I can on the computer. Hopefully Pinterest will fix that for Android.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00A8SPNYW 3 1365465600 24 I really like the game but it's too hard to play and get any where. I wish there were games that weren't so hard.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B006TH5I28 5 1365465600 45 This really stretches my Kindle's battery life tremendously. It shuts down system draining Apps and or asks you if you'd like to shut them down. Between that and turning off the wi-fi my Kindle can last 8 to 10 hours depending on what I'm doing.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B006OOHYIC 5 1365465600 52 Quell games are challenging but fun and relaxing. They have links to their site for solutions if you gt in a jam. I know because I've had to use it on several occasions. They look too hard to solve, but in reality, you just need to step back and think it through.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00CZCX2S8 2 1389052800 124 I play this game on my computer and my Droid phone without any problems of any kind.However the simple act of trying to play it on my Kindle Fire always proves to be a slow and nearly hopeless endeavor.  Finally I get into the game and purchase two (2) (free) bingo cards. Just as the game starts I am tossed out of the game back to my Kindle homepage. Every time I try to play! All I can do with any success is to claim my bonuses every 20 hours.  That's is.  I can't find a way to get help with the game either as I would rather find a way to fix it before giving up. But I may have no other choice.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B009UWL580 5 1364774400 28 Just like really playing only easier and much more rewarding! If you have even enjoyed this a little bit in real life you will love playing this game!!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00EDEMLTW 1 1376006400 67 I immediately un-installed this from my Kindle and from my Apps list completely. They want way too much information. They collect it through sneaky and back handed ways. They install two separate Apps on your Kindle system. One collects information and runs ads. Bad news! I immediately got rid of both of them! I don't need Apps like those and I don't think anyone else does either!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B009KEN87O 5 1365465600 30 Just like the games we started playing years ago. It's fun to play games like them again just to relax and look back. We sure have come a long way.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B006Z0KKIG 5 1365465600 22 Relaxing and fun to play. You can play to have fun or play to win. You choose the mode. It's straight forward.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B007FJFDXS 5 1360108800 69 This game is a challenge in a different way. You need to move your object through a course and pick up cubes along the way to the exit. Along the way, you also face obstacles and other surprises that you will need to overcome or use to your advantage to get to the exit. It really is a fun game! Try it, I think you will like it too.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00D1P685C 1 1388361600 80 This app doesn't help me to clean up my Kindle Fire in any way at all. Nor does it help to clear up or delete any programs or filesof any kind at all. Whenever I try to use the app only a few other apps are shown listed by it. Then when I try to do anything at all the app simply vanishes (closes) and I'm left looking at my app library. This app has been such a let down!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00ELMHHAE 5 1389225600 34 This truly is a great free slots game!! Collect free bonuses every 4 hours! As your playing level increases so will your bonus.  Good sound effects and music to enhance the game experience. Enjoy!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00BGC5UAG 4 1365465600 29 easy to pick up what and how to play. Not always easy to get the correct word. As you go along it gets harder to get the correct words.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B0066T8SDU 5 1365465600 42 I really like the single player feature of this game. You don't need to log into facebook or any other social media network to play. You simply click on single player and play against the computer. Though you cannot set difficulty level.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B0064QNS62 5 1365465600 32 I love playing games like this. The games we all started on. Though this is a bit tougher, I still like it. Give it a try, I think you'l like it too.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00J05XSGY 5 1398902400 53 After the tutorial you may feel a bit lost. I did at the time I started my first game. For me the key was to establish a pattern (in a sense &amp; Pay attention to the board too) in how I move and add together the numbers as soon as the game begins.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00B20CMJE 2 1365465600 30 It was too hard from the start and not to my liking. It's simple and straight forward so I thought I'd like it. But for some reason I un-installed it.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00DBCJLOA 5 1376524800 29 Love the vldeo poker! It's just like Vegas. I think you will enjoy it too. Pick how much you wawnt to bet and your game will start.  Good luck!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B006P2Y2QK 5 1365465600 22 Enjoyable game. Plays well and you can make adjustments to the game as well. I play this game routinely and enjoy it.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00A6D5GBE 4 1365465600 40 Fun game. Gets tricky rather quickly. You need to pay attention. There are short cuts & you don't have to get everything on the screen to advance. You don't need a perfect score to move ahead, unless you want it.
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00AAX68HG 5 1379376000 122 Cleverly conceived concepts and puzzles to solve; that will keep anyone entertained for a good while!! Almost every puzzle is a challenge that makes one think without being too challenging as too frustrate you into wanting to give up and quit. I don't like games that you feel like you have to be a genius to play them.Don't get me wrong; you will have puzzles in this game that you'll need to try and figure out several times to solve. Or to accomplish in a timely manor. But it will be so satisifing when you do!But for the most part the puzzles are unique and therefore require a different approach to problem solving to accomplish your goals. Good luck and have fun!
A12VA4IT2HOBXR B00BTYP6QE 5 1378684800 122 Each game in the &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; series has something new and interesting to offer in game play. This version does that too and with it's own imaginative surprises!!The great thing about these games is that they are not too hard for the average game player; while still interesting enough for those more advanced. The perfect balance! They are challenging don't mis-understand me. You can figure out each level. Though some may take trial and error to figure them out. I speak from experience. You can play a level over again to improve your final score on that level as well.Try each &quot;Cut the Rope&quot; app if you get the chance.  These apps respond so perfectly too. You'll have fun with them!
A12VDT80EJJNT1 B0073LHCCS 4 1360454400 28 I'm always looking for games that challenge me to think and this one does the job without driving me to pull my hair out.  It's just difficult enough.
A12VDT80EJJNT1 B00CKW6FVE 5 1369699200 36 I have always loved the original tetris game and when I found tetris blitz by chance I knew I had to have it.  fun game play and no drag and drop makes for a rapid session.
A12VDT80EJJNT1 B0087TQYUG 5 1362009600 21 I do love this game.  It's a fun workout for your brain and a great game to play with your friends.
A12VDT80EJJNT1 B008VRQNIC 5 1360281600 32 Forgotten Mysteries is a fun hidden object game.  It's just difficult enough to keep you playing without being frustrating. Too often this genre is complicated, leading players to quit out of frustration.
A12VDT80EJJNT1 B0091REZMW 4 1367798400 50 this game is great. it does take patience if you want to keep it free but that gives you time to do other games.  it recharges fairly quick and will notify you when it has.  the objects are not always in the same place which keeps it fresh and challenging.
A12VDT80EJJNT1 B00C5J4MO4 5 1375401600 29 great game for social play.  I have tried other golf games and quickly deleted them because they were too complicated but this one is easy to learn and play.
A12VEL9WMX8CH9 B00A8ECU24 3 1388188800 27 We enjoy playing the game but somethimes have issues with it loading. When it loads, it is fun, but when it doesn't load that is very frustrating.
A12VEL9WMX8CH9 B00F8H0LM2 5 1388188800 26 My kiddos, my husband, and myself all love this game. It is easy enough for the youngest and challenging enough for the the oldest of us.
A12VIERTYISNHS B0064X7FVE 5 1404691200 4 love the weather channel.
A12VIERTYISNHS B008R5RGAC 5 1404691200 7 love, love, love Norton, I trust this.
A12VIERTYISNHS B0062QUNHG 5 1404691200 2 great devotional
A12VIERTYISNHS B008D29K7G 5 1404691200 2 very informative!
A12VJ9Z6P5H2PU B009XAJI8S 3 1362614400 27 You can watch slot of your favorite channels. Although the system is always buffering, it's free and fun. Has an upgrade, maybe that would help with buffering.
A12VKJKSH04P02 B004X7ZK3S 5 1305763200 47 This app is the greatest app to ever come along.  Anybody who doesn't download this should just kill themselves.  This app will do everything in the description,  plus cure cancer,  solve world hunger, and keep Arnold Schwarzenegger from getting any more staffers pregnant.  A must have app.
A12VKJKSH04P02 B004SRLB1I 1 1301788800 32 If all this cat does is repeat back what you say to it, why would the app need read/write  access to my SD card, phone records, have full internet access, and more?
A12VLWZD6U6KY1 B00A8ECU24 4 1402963200 61 I love my little pony and I love this game except there is a down side. Rainbow Dash and Rarity cost a lot of gems. It would take forever to get that many , so you pretty much HAVE to buy them. I wish there was a free game that was actually free, because so far I have not found one.
A12VO1CF8HB7MA B007URBVA4 5 1363305600 61 I never would have thought to give this to my 2 year old, but it's his favorite.  Every now and then, he gets ahold of my daughter's kindle and somehow always ends up on this, so funny to see him sit and concentrate on one thing for awhile.  Older kids got bored after not too long, but younger ones love it.
A12VO1CF8HB7MA B00AM5JTV4 4 1363305600 54 Decent game, have to say I was shocked by how many times it got me (I'm the mom...).  I was more apt to go back and try to get it right, kids seemed to lose interest after messing up too many times, but they're all under 7 yrs.  Good for encouraging focus to detail.
A12VOPM9JTG1EZ B00FAX6XQC 3 1402272000 24 was great until I got to the south Africa hunts. now the game just freezes up everytime I start a hunt. in that region

A12VTKNIPO80FY B00BI2QOYA 1 1362873600 45 Although this is listed as compatible with my Toshiba Thive it will not even open. Goes to a black screen, then dumps me back to my home screen. Have played quite a few other Big Fish Games on this tablet without a problem. Very disappointing.
A12VTKNIPO80FY B00DJFIMW6 5 1399939200 35 Not a big fan of endless running games as it gets boring running through the same exact course and obstales over and over. Not the case with Minion Rush...it is different every time. Well done!
A12VTKNIPO80FY B00910Y1OQ 5 1350259200 70 Well done game. Match 3 games are one of my favorite type of game. Nice twist added to the concept. Graphic are well done. Looks great on my tablet. First match 3 game I have found that didn't force me to play with the tablet held in portrait orientation.  That's a big plus in my book. Happy to have gotten as the FAOTD. Price point does seem a little high.
A12VTKNIPO80FY B004V5A7K8 5 1351900800 47 Great twist on a classic game. Fun to play with good replay value. As another reviewer commented, I often lost the ball while chasing other things on the screen. Smooth game play on my tablet. If you like retro games, this one is well worth the download.
A12W9LVQ6TY66P B007NACZPI 4 1332547200 22 fun app, lots of fun, but is not giving me reward from doing some of the tasks. I love the app overall.
A12W9LVQ6TY66P B00E8KLWB4 4 1399248000 67 I like this game cause it gives you different tasks to finish, which keeps you wanting to play. Also, it has different types of puzzles you can play besides just finding objects. However, I like to take my time when playing hidden objects games but this one gives you a time limit, sometimes not enough, and you fail the level until you finish it within that time.
A12W9LVQ6TY66P B00AREIAI8 5 1376784000 25 Easy to use and very fun! Can't put the game down! A lot more realistic than other horse games and easier to use than others.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B00IG2DOKM 5 1401494400 20 Quick, fun, easy way to waste time. The game if fun for all ages. Enjoy with your kids or alone.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B004MC8CA2 5 1349136000 22 what better way to have a Bible with you always.Always handy in good times and bad. a must have for any Christian.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B008XG1X18 5 1376697600 47 You can't go wrong with pintrest! The app is great because I can take interest with me and feed my pinning addiction even when I am away from the house. Have not had a problem with this app and I have had it for months upon months.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B0063IH60K 5 1350864000 21 play over and over. The app has no problems, play is smooth and easy. So glad I down loaded this app!
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B00DZYXTRY 5 1390435200 79 We downloaded this game on our kindles....that is me, the mom, at age 34, my daughter who is 10 and my son who is 7...we all love it! My daughter and I had a race to see who could collect all 50 States. My 7 year old is learning his US geography younger than is taught in school and he loves it. They enjoy stacking the States of course and do not realize they are learning while they play.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B007F2EGFQ 1 1350777600 32 The app worked great for 4 levels and now it will not regenerate my &quot;magic&quot; so i can play. very disappointing! i hope it will be fixed soon for the kindle fire.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B00G4A6VZS 5 1390435200 40 I downloaded this app to my kindle and then bought it for my 3 kids as well and their kindles! We all love playing and learning about the countries around the World. My 4th grader and 2nd grader love it.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B007PW1BZY 5 1334966400 31 started playing phase 10 at the firehall and fell in love with the game!  this app is awesome and allows me ti okay whenever I want. great game and great app.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B0064ETS1I 5 1330905600 24 Fun little way to pass time.I have no problems from the app. It always loads, its easy to understand and the graphics are good.
A12WA5YQ5IYWMC B00A3E2BVE 4 1378080000 68 I love playing this game and was thrilled there was an app on my kindle. Lately however the app fails to launch and I can't play. I have uninstalled the app several times and reinstalled thinking perhaps something did not install correctly. Alias it still does not work....I would give 5 stars if I was not having all the problems I am having but the game is great!
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B0071PS7AC 4 1330992000 135 I play on the Kindle Fire. I haven't experienced any of the control problems that others are having. Every game I've bowled, I've won. It took some getting used to, but I think it is a fun game to pass the time in between appts, etc. It is simple enough that an older kid could play. The reason I only give 4 stars is because I don't quite get the whole money thing after you win. It's not like you can bet with it. It is just there, with your recent scores. Seems like the game should have another aspect or something.I think the graphics were good, and you can change the color & weight of your ball, which is neat. I would NOT recommend this for cell phones, or anything with a small screen.
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B006QZA1YI 5 1331337600 77 I babysit for a 3 year old with Asperger's. He absolutely LOVES this game. He can play it over and over again. The best part about it is that he doesn't speak often, but when he plays Tracing ABC, he excitedly says the letters when they come on the screen &amp; he repeats after the names in the pictures. May not seem like a big deal to you, but it really is an awesome thing to see!
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B006RC0ZP0 1 1327104000 135 I got this as the faotd for my Kindle Fire.  It worked fine the first time I played survival mode. When I went to check out timed mode, it didn't have any fish swim across the screen, and just kept the white banner that says,&quot;pop fish as they swim by&quot;. I tapped the screen to see if that would make it start, but it was almost like it was frozen, except it would say &quot;nice try&quot;, etc, all the while keeping the white banner. Since there is no way to back out of a mode, I just exited the app. I went back in to play survival mode, and had the same problem. So glad I didn't pay for this. I'm uninstalling now. Really disappointed in Amazon's Faotd choices lately. They should do better screening.
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B004TTY694 5 1325548800 143 I use InkPad on my Kindle Fire. I think it is a great app. The very small ads at the top don't bother me one bit. I also think that it is super convenient that my notes are saved automatically. It makes the title be the first line of your note, which you have the ability to change from the menu. I didn't have any problem snailing a note yo myself. Since this is a free app, the lack of font &amp; color selection didn't bother me. It would've nice if the developers went that direction, but I will still use it even if they don't.I downloaded a couple of other note apps (including Notepad) but uninstalled all but this one. I loved that this one opens up to a &quot;corkboard&quot; and makes all my notes easy to find. Very simple to use!
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B005Z4BGY0 4 1332374400 200 I played this on my Kindle Fire. Everything opened great for me, the graphics were sharp and the music was clear.pros: This was a pretty original play for me. I love iSpy type games, and the added puzzle feature was a bonus. I also really liked the different music pieces that were chosen for the games. The story line was cute as well (if you cared to follow).cons: there is no volume control in the game itself. I had to close out of it, turn the volume down through my settings, and go back into the game. Also, some of the items were difficult to click (and I would say I have regular/small fingers). Finally, in order to &quot;find&quot; some of the pieces, you need to click on a variety of other items in the room first. If you don't realize this, it can be really frustrating.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I beat it on the easier mode. I haven't tried the hard level yet. I wouldn't recommend this for little kids, as they may have a difficult time doing the puzzle portion. Also, if you have no sense of tone/music, this may not be the game for you.
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B004O3YGMC 2 1326067200 67 It only works when my Kindle Fire is on the same wireless network as the computer I would like to remote onto. Doesn't do me much good considering if I'm on the same wireless network, I probably don't need to remote onto my comp. If they fixed that, it would easily be worth five stars. Glad I got it as the FAOTD and didn't pay for it.
A12WB8BDIQCLB3 B0064TVQ5E 3 1325203200 100 Kindle Fire -Pros: it has 20 levels, great graphics, relaxing music, fun twist on classic gameCons: force closes every couple of games, hard to locate volume controlsConsidering the fact that this App is free, it isn't terrible. Like others, I really enjoyed the relaxing music, as well as the graphics. I would have liked to have easier accessible volume control, but that isn't my biggest complaint. The app randomly closes out every third game or so. it was really frustrating. I completed all of the levels (20 total in the free version) out of pure determination, but will be uninstalling.
A12WBPCE2LBC7X B0094BB4TW 4 1356393600 43 Althought it's a great way to keep in touch with friends and family, it is very time consuming.  I just don't have the time to keep up with it. But my friends and family love it so it must be a good thing!
A12WBPCE2LBC7X B0064X7B4A 5 1356393600 24 When my family can't be together to play our favorite game, Scrabble, we get online and play Words!  It's like being together! Love it!
A12WBPCE2LBC7X B005V1N71W 3 1356393600 32 I wish Pandora would allow me to pick the specific music I want to hear.  I guess it wasn't designed to do that.  So it's just a three star review from me.
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00F1XSETA 4 1391126400 20 This is a fun challenging game. Fun for the entire family. Hours of fun, great for Game night, or teams.
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00DZYXTRY 4 1394582400 81 This game is fun and addictive!  For those that are learning The United States, or those wanting to refresh your memory, or just learn new facts. This game is great!  I learned a lot. The nicknames and flags for each state, I had never studied. Now I can quote them with little difficulty, (still learning). This game is great for school kids to elderly. Can be very helpful for those learning English as a second language. Try it , it's free!!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00ARIGX4M 5 1393891200 45 I really like and enjoy this game. The graphics on the food are cute and I enjoy the time challenge. This game is great for school age to adults. Have a great team night! I've been playing this game for a while, and it's awesome!!!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00FPH8L40 4 1393891200 34 This game I found fun, but at times you may need to ask someone else for help with a product name. The graphics are nice and true to the label. Fun for any age.
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00GIZO674 5 1393891200 28 This game is great! Very addictive. The food graphics are wonderful. I enjoy the different levels and the time challenge.Great for Game Night. For kids of all ages!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B0080HQXTM 5 1393891200 23 I enjoy this free app. The information seems accurate, and the imagery is realistic. I have it on my phone and KIndle Fire.
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00G357N92 5 1397433600 32 Last week I tried Happy Chef 1, this week Happy Chef 2. I love them both. The graphics are cute. And the music is cool too. I'm addicted!!! Great for all ages!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B0061RRV62 3 1394582400 32 If you've played this game at home with friends before, this version is the same. You do have the option of playing against the computer, but with someone is fun too.  Enjoy!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00H42WDAC 3 1393891200 24 I enjoyed this introductory free game. It was fun while it lasted, however that wasn't very long. I didn't like it enough to buy.
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00DRJJAQG 3 1391126400 30 This game has lots of beautiful pictures of far away places. It is challenging if you've never traveled much, but fun. Families will enjoy this game on Game Night. Enjoy!!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B004TTY694 4 1393891200 37 I like this app. I use it at church to take notes, at home for my to do list, or when out shopping to keep track of prices. I have it on my phone and Kindle Fire.
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00H3FNAOI 3 1393891200 37 I like this app. The art backgrounds are nice. And they can be cheaper changed with just a tap. This app is good for those with vision issues, because the numbers are large. Enjoy your free app!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00702PZME 3 1395273600 43 I enjoyed this game for the hour it took to do all the free unlocked games. Some words are more difficult than others, but you can try more than one time. I'm not purchasing the unlocked games, but that's up to you. Enjoy!!
A12WCO9LEZPHY8 B00GRXA7GG 4 1395273600 24 I enjoyed this game, as I do most Mahjong games. If you like this type of game ,I would suggest it. Not difficult. Enjoy!
A12WDFOCQ0RT2T B005V1N71W 4 1383091200 20 Enjoy Pandora....never had it before and when I got an email message to try it thought I would...glad I did~!
A12WDFOCQ0RT2T B00BX736EG 5 1373414400 21 This game keeps you thinking.  It gets harder as you go on so the game is never dull and always challenging
A12WDFOCQ0RT2T B00D0VZLVE 5 1373241600 30 This game makes you think and is a lot of fun.  You Can easily skip a phase if the answer just doen't come to you and then go back later!
A12WDFOCQ0RT2T B00CRLSN4U 5 1375228800 29 Lots of fun.  Enjoy playing with friends to see who can guess it first!  I would recommend this app to anyone!  Get it and enjoy.  The price is right!
A12WDFOCQ0RT2T B0088Y7YHW 4 1400371200 22 I enjoy playing slots and this game is really fun.  It gives u enough of a challenge but let's u win too
A12WEMARL7F6CA B00DJFIMW6 5 1379203200 21 cool love the movie its a cool game you can run jump and roll defeat bad guys too try it you
A12WEMARL7F6CA B006D1ONE4 5 1375920000 53 at first I was excited to start finally playing where's my water and then.after a while I started to get bored so I stopped playing it. about a month later I saw it in my games file and it caught my eye noe I'm completely addicted and am now not at all bored
A12WEMARL7F6CA B00EWK8N8A 5 1379116800 28 i think that this is quite cute its funny and addicting too. it was kind of like cut the rope but it was also different in other ways.
A12WEMARL7F6CA B006ON41FC 5 1329868800 32 I love it it is addiicting for a reason unknown it is a challenging game specifically interesting Don't know what to say so blah blah blah blah blah thanks to reading this
A12WEMARL7F6CA B009UX2YAC 5 1385769600 22 Love this game. It has so many different scenes. If u like stuff like temple run its like that without the tilting
A12WHJ2ZJLSJKN B00B7Y0206 1 1376784000 29 This app sucks, it always buffers for 20 minutes then plays for 2 seconds then loses connection, and it will load for three hours and only show one video.
A12WIG16XJ8Z28 B004MC8CA2 4 1344729600 31 only thing I didn't like was that you have to be connected to the web for it to work. boo. I go camping a lot and expect it to work everywhere.
A12WLYPUUMW5TD B006OBWGHO 5 1340668800 20 you are almost there you have to get it a lite deter then you have it. I love you too
A12WLYPUUMW5TD B008B0S0XK 5 1394668800 19 it is so food that it is worth so much money.EA SPORTS IS THE BEST!OH MY GOSH BEST GAME.
A12WLYPUUMW5TD B009UX2YAC 5 1351814400 24 it is so fun. we all love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it
A12WNR8KCMIY8C B0066T8SDU 5 1321747200 26 I love being able to play Scrabble with my friends from anywhere! Easy to use. Be aware that there is not a single player option, though.
A12WNR8KCMIY8C B00A3NQNUU 5 1374710400 21 I love this app! Fun mini-games, good graphics. I like being able to interact with friends. I would definitely recommend it.
A12WNR8KCMIY8C B0055SWM08 5 1327881600 24 I just got this game and I love it! It is challenging without being overly difficult. I will be recommending this to my friends.
A12WTZIZ4EHCT1 B008ZOHCKE 5 1359504000 29 I love to journal and use some for that, I like to make lists so use it for that also.  Another use is for family information.  Easy to use.
A12WTZIZ4EHCT1 B0063GORYU 5 1340064000 22 I am addicted, have spent way too much time playing it.  Looking forward to playing it more.  It is a great game.
A12WTZIZ4EHCT1 B007ZGO7EM 5 1403049600 20 I use this usually when in a hurry - it is simple to use.  I would recommend this calculator app
A12X0RCX7GEOLD B008H4MVRG 5 1342656000 36 funner than i expected it to be turns outs to be really easy to play too great for younger kids if you have kids that wanna use your kindle this is perfect for them to play
A12X0RCX7GEOLD B008JJS6D2 5 1346889600 26 finally a real bingo game for free only wish it had better graphics but ill give it time for updates try it out its really fun
A12X0RCX7GEOLD B00A4KVFLY 5 1366156800 28 if you love the show youll love the game its really fun and you can play against your friends to see who gets a better over all score
A12X1AGY9UUBBD B0086700CM 5 1338249600 33 finally. temple run but the cheats don't work on kindle. but its just like the apple version I regimen this app even for 90 cents even for 1 dollar. its a MUST HAVE
A12X3J7IITW1J6 B005V1N71W 5 1368835200 30 pandora is the greatest, and now listening to it on my kindle is the greatest :) i did upgrade because i switch songs so much, but its so worth it.
A12X3J7IITW1J6 B005ZXWMUS 5 1393286400 52 I love netflix, and i always will. after getting a kindle tablet i love watching movies on it and reading books and everything :) the only thing about watching movies from Netflix on the kindle is that it drains the battery fast- but hey, it does that with everything so its normal!
A12X3J7IITW1J6 B00AIUUXHC 5 1368835200 60 yeah this game is awesome. i recently got a kindle for my birthday in March, and now i am the biggest shark i could possibly be :) my boyfriend constantly looks at me and says &#34;oh REALLY, MORE shark attack?! you go girl&#34; haha i love it, and he knows he loves it too. awesome fun game to pass time
A12XAC71WUMKSA B00A0YXZVW 5 1356912000 132 I love the fact that this game does not require you to buy little things for real money to continue on with your game. Everything you need can be generated through the buildings provided, this is a nice change from games like farm Ville where you had to spend $30 just to buy enough fake in game money to skip quests that you had to otherwise wait until your 1 - 2 friends send you one of the 25 nails you need to build a well with a wait time of days for each nail. All in all, this game is exceptional in that the wait timers are reasonable and don't cause you to lose interest while playing, graphics are cute and cartoonist, and it is definitely a very family friendly game.
A12XAC71WUMKSA B00BFUUMO8 4 1365120000 27 Very similar to any farm/zoo/park game. everything has an eh loading time and you spend real money for fake money for fake coins to speed things up.
A12XAC71WUMKSA B008IU2GVA 5 1361145600 133 I browsed top 10 App games looking for something interesting to play, but I only got the same &#34;angry birds, doodle jump, etc&#34; crap. This game would be my personal #1 app game. There's tons of levels, the tower defense is really fun, there's multiple characters to choose from, and you don't have to pay to beat each level. You only have to pay if you want to buy armor, but you can do everything without it.The only drawback is the ridiculous giant breasts advertisement all over this thing. It's kind of embarrassing when I want to show friends this great game and they're like &#34;uh, the one with the giant tits? Yeah, I'm sure it's a great game.....&#34; When it obviously looks like some half-done porn app. It just loses all credibility.
A12XAC71WUMKSA B008BK5HJK 5 1361145600 24 Really interesting game, fun to play and waste time on. Puzzles are mildly hard, good time sink, it's free, what more do you need?
A12XAC71WUMKSA B00992CF6W 1 1358467200 67 I love minecraft on the pc. Very bummed over the pocket edition. Its very hard to move and strafe, and trying to tap the screen to place blocks and break them is slow, tedius, and difficult. Fighting is very hard. I wish the kindle had a demo version like the google nexus and samsung galaxy. Do not waste 6.99 on it. Play it on the pc instead.
A12XAC71WUMKSA B007C7UZIG 5 1361145600 88 I enjoy Steam, I buy all my games on Steam, my gf shares my account and we can both play Skyrim side by side on our computers at the same time using one account. We buy co op games and have LAN parties because Steam is pretty simple to set up games with. The layout is easy to navigate, annnnnnnnnd yeah. I guess the only one negative thing I can think of is sometimes Voice chatting through steam can be wonky. I use skype instead. That's about it.
A12XAOIJGUKMF7 B00HRMNKWE 1 1398988800 26 This game is not that hard. It's really easy to play I thought it was going to be harder than this. I guess it's a keeper.
A12XAOIJGUKMF7 B00BNH1PF8 5 1365638400 22 Good . Fun to play couple challenges but over all is a great game to play with the  family and with friends
A12XAOIJGUKMF7 B0088QGB7Y 5 1367712000 21 This game is the coolest game ever I enjoy playing it and I will continue to at this game  every day
A12XB2BANLUTO7 B00529IOXO 5 1376784000 146 My mom and I were on a little trip, relaxing at the hotel, browsing and playing with apps for our new Kindle Fires. My husband couldn't come along because of work, so I usually keep in touch by texting.  I found and downloaded this app, then sent a message to his cell.  His next message back was, &#34;Um, how are you texting to me from your Kindle?&#34;Hah!  HE'S the gadget geek, but I got him.  Free texting between Kindles (using Wi-Fi connection), but it will add charges to the cell phone bills, so we need to use that feature judiciously.  You can change the Text+ Kindle phone number ONCE (I live in the West, and the Text+ system assigned me a number based in PA).It could come in handy in an emergency, if my cell phone battery has died, AGAIN!  Good features, from a free App!
A12XB2BANLUTO7 B007NZV2HK 2 1376697600 88 I downloaded this to have something to occupy myself while waiting for appointments or on a break. The puzzles are easy and quick to complete. However, the colored lines try to swoop everywhere but where I'm trying to cover the words and one went up at an angle not on any word, off the edge of the puzzle altogether. Never could erase it during that game. Then I saw the other reviews about the adware, so decided to remove it from my Kindle. Good thing it was free.
A12XB2BANLUTO7 B00AXKPWSM 5 1376697600 61 I'm not a techno-geek, but had little trouble with this fun app. Uploaded photos from my PC to the Cloud (after downloading another app to the PC to connect to the Cloud), then downloaded the photos to my Kindle Fire HD. Pick a photo from the gallery you create, then you're ready. The edit features are easy and fun to use.
A12XB2BANLUTO7 B005DSLRDS 5 1376784000 53 This is the best app for sounds I've found, bar none. This doesn't do just one. If you like Star Wars (R2 robot, Chewbacca), or Woody Woodpecker, machine sounds, animal sounds, arcade game sounds and a whole lot more, you're in for a treat.  I spent almost an hour picking out my favorites.
A12XJB1UHAENEK B004YLSLIY 5 1373500800 27 I love this game and play it often.  It is such a challenge to try and beat the letters that are going to inevitably blow me away.
A12XJB1UHAENEK B007N8RULO 4 1373500800 20 I love this game but it's kind of hard to get the cards to move within such a small space.
A12XJB1UHAENEK B004LZIZHU 5 1373500800 25 This game is exciting and fast moving, it really gets my heart racing!! The excitement and thrill of trying to beat the clock is great.
A12XJCNZUODGAK B00AIQP9DE 5 1367625600 52 I love the fact it has different levels not just one.  ONCE I FINISH BEGINNERS LEVEL I can switch to a harder level.  This means more time to play. It is worth the money because I can play it more than once. I would buy another l I or this.  Good fun.
A12XJCNZUODGAK B00A8ECU24 5 1368489600 37 I grew up with my little pony. I love being able to build my towns and make pony friend with everything. It keeps me entertained for a long time. I look forward to e a chance game
A12XJCNZUODGAK B00CWY76CC 4 1387756800 23 Want sure when I first got this app. I thought it would been boring but Like it. I like it. keeps me thinking.
A12XLXP49MB79P B008JGSM6G 5 1342828800 24 This is an addictive game. What I like most about it is that it is a mind teaser and helps keep my brain/mind agile.
A12XLXP49MB79P B004MC8CA2 5 1343260800 86 I love the fact that I can go through the Bible in a year and it is all set up for me (or even less e.g., 60 or 90 days), and it is easy to use. What is really nice is that I can use the speech option and have it read aloud to me. I use this sometimes when I want to go through the reading again and it is easier to listen either meditatively, or while I am doing something mundane, like the dishes.
A12XLXP49MB79P B006VW94HQ 4 1342915200 42 This is a fun distraction when I am working on a project and need to clear my mind. The one problem is that sometimes I get so engaged that I lose track of time, so I have to set a timer occasionally.
A12XONKLD3SSY9 B00IKZX1ZI 4 1395187200 24 This is a fun game that is challenging but entertaining. I enjoy this game even though it takes a minute to load the levels.
A12XONKLD3SSY9 B007ZGO7EM 4 1388966400 33 I l love this app. I use it all the time to help me figure out what I need. It is designed very well and easy to use. I recommend this app highly.
A12XONKLD3SSY9 B00FAPF5U0 5 1387929600 25 Fun and addicting. I love the game. The levels are challenging but fun to play. Got addicted on Facebook and now I'm even more addicted.
A12XTJIHXLPJKG B004Q3CJQ0 5 1389225600 33 Easy to use tool for flashlight.  Gives you a few different options but I prefer the LED light - good for reading in bed, car, or hiking through the Amazon jungle at night.
A12XTJIHXLPJKG B005V1N71W 4 1388534400 46 been using Pandora for a few years and now getting around to reviewing.  Switched to Spotify for a while but now mixing between both.  Great for free music service and introducing me to new music.  Plays some of the same songs more than I would like.
A12XTJIHXLPJKG B00EUADLTS 5 1388448000 37 Purchased as viewer for Mom's Fire so she can see Wife and I's instagram pix.  Really like the viewer - grid view instead of 1 by 1 on instagram.  Only complaint as the app stalls out sometimes.
A12XZ6VT9XMFNE B008G0HTUU 5 1350604800 58 i had this app on my kindle fire but it didnt charge and i had to get a new kindle fire and it was a kinde fire HD.I had to start over witch sucked but at least i still have this app and i know i have to use my money wise and stil i love this app
A12XZ6VT9XMFNE B00B7ERH04 1 1360281600 25 Why can't the video camera setting be for free with no camcoins to get it. One day it'll be for free. But camera is free
A12XZCNI6C8BIT B00ED4TX2A 4 1379462400 59 I like this game because it's basically a scavenger hunt. Yes, if you're an aggressive and serious gamer, you'll probably find you have to spend real money for energy. But for me, I just take a break and let my energy build up. Graphics are nice. It has not crashed at all.  Works great on my Kindle Fire HD.
A12XZCNI6C8BIT B008FRG6JO 5 1368144000 22 Fast and accurate. Works better than the app on my computer. Coupons work too. Now I can be truly fat and lazy.
A12XZCNI6C8BIT B004JJUY4K 5 1377993600 21 App works wonderfully on the Kindle Fire HD! Lots of filter settings so you can search for exactly what you want!
A12XZCNI6C8BIT B008PPGFZG 1 1370736000 64 I don't hate the app, because I never got to use the app, because you cannot use INSTAGRAM on Kindle Fire HD, thus any other apps tailored to Instagram and sold in the Amazon App Store are useless and IMO misleading. Pretty darn sad since there is a perfectly good INSTAGRAM FOR ANDROID app out there, for the rest of the planet to use.
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B00CWY76CC 5 1370736000 27 can't stop playing... then the game ends.... seems too short... but fun nonetheless... scenes are neat, finding tools isn't too challenging, just the right amount of difficulty.
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B00CWGWAEE 5 1372723200 23 this is what I consider the best kind of Big Fish games... perfect amount of difficulty, excellent graphics... but there's gotta be more!!!
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B00B4VI8MQ 4 1368316800 21 this game is decent... lots of hidden object scenes... just a bit too short.... I will stick to G5 games though.
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B008X8QCTO 5 1351814400 42 really, I think this game is great.  just the right amount of difficulty to be challenging and fun.  sure, it was a lot to install, but it's a huge app, and you can see that before you purchase...  I highly recommend it!
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B0091REZMW 2 1352851200 21 this WOULD be a fun game if you could EARN DIAMONDS.  and the prices to buy diamonds are RIDICULOUS!  overall.... suck.
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B008BMNGD2 5 1389225600 26 Another winner from Big Fish.  Great mix of hidden object scenes and puzzles.  Only drawbacks:  no zoom,  and it tends to lag a bit between actions.
A12XZMO4VY8LUE B00AA87JGU 4 1370736000 26 it's a great game, lots of variation... but paying for more levels isn't cool... wish they'd just charge the standard $1.99 and give you ALL LEVELS...
A12Y20A7JPIB55 B008CFVG58 5 1360627200 28 This is a fun game.  It is very addictive.  My kids can play it too.  Great way to pass the time or get your mind off of things.
A12Y20A7JPIB55 B007VDWMQO 3 1360627200 21 I liked the game but went through all the questions quickly before they started showing up again.  It needs more questions.
A12Y4YFNY9LVX0 B0072KBY2Y 5 1355011200 24 This app is great for locating cheapest gas around... nearby hotels, etc. The only problem is sometimes is crashes when you switch search locations.
A12Y4YFNY9LVX0 B0088P2A7A 5 1355011200 24 This is a great app for anyone who loves Wikipedia as much as I do. It makes viewing Wikipedia articles optimal for my device.
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B004VMUS9G 5 1384819200 20 I use this often.  It's quite and gradually gets louder and louder.  Work great on my Kindle!  It's a keeper!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B007BH7T90 5 1384819200 21 Fun and enjoyable!  Got to pay attention the screen is small on the Kindle but otherwise works well.  Good for travel.
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B00BIK524A 3 1384819200 23 It's a fun game but after the first time playing it I really don't want to play it again.  Good for one play!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B004QQ7KV6 3 1384819200 58 I like this app but there are problems with this app on my Kindle.  Often it won't load and then the info chosen is totally different from what I read.  For instance, I chose to read about the Kardasians and instead am reading about Iron Man 3.  don't know if this is a Kindle problem or normal problem!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B0055DL1G4 5 1384819200 20 Love this app.  Covers everything and can check in several times a day!  Enjoy catching up on the national news!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B004DPIEF6 5 1384819200 21 It's fun top use when we are ghost Hunting.  Sometimes it actually seems to work!  It's a keeper and it's fun!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B0064X7FVE 5 1384819200 22 reat app, highly recommend it.  I don't get just my weather but friends and family all over the States.  It's a keeper!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B0063IH60K 3 1384819200 21 It's a nice diversion from mahjong.  Fun to tackle when I need a change from mahjong.  Works nice on the Kindle!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B0067Q4DPE 3 1402444800 21 Very short game for price.  Good graphics and outstanding color.  Just way to short.  Rather disappointing!  Needs a bit more work!
A12Y54E0ZF8017 B00514DIE0 4 1384819200 29 It's a good game but I've only reached the 15th level and that's on easy.  I'd rather have a mahjong game that progresses, instead of starting over and over!
A12Y6LREPWFNGN B00ENTDDGW 4 1382745600 39 I downloaded this for the kids. they seem to enjoy it. It was easy to put on my kindle and when they left I took it off. Just something for them to play with. but the really enjoyed it.
A12Y6LREPWFNGN B00DJFIMW6 2 1382745600 26 they were disappointed because you had to use internet to play this one, and we didn't have it where we were so they were somewhat disappointed.
A12Y9Z00HXA9VZ B0064T6LV8 4 1393027200 41 It takes me back to my lunch times playing pinball at the bus station, in the 60's before we had all these games. It was a nickle a game. I didn't give it a 5 because you can't tilt it! lolBill
A12Y9Z00HXA9VZ B005ZXWMUS 5 1395705600 31 If you don't have NETFLIX your missing out we put it off for a couple years, but now we have it on our TV all computers including our kindle. have fun
A12Y9Z00HXA9VZ B007ZGO7EM 4 1395705600 21 I like it but it's an app. if you are away from your wireless it's back to a pin and paper
A12YB84TFROIXH B004DM1OAQ 5 1365033600 52 Very entertaining. Enjoy the various levels of difficulty. Some reviews complain the CPU gets too many doubles. Balderdash. The game has an undo button to help you learn how to make better moves and in other games you get the majority of doubles. It balances out. Get the game. You'll love it.
A12YB84TFROIXH B00AIQP9DE 4 1361577600 42 This is my kind of game. It is fun and intriguing. The only problem I have is that it takes up so much space on my kindle fire. This made it run slower. Otherwise I have really enjoyed the game very much.
A12YB84TFROIXH B004VMUS9G 5 1360800000 65 This is perfect. It has options that allow me to keep track of every activity for the whole family. It allows for all the variations for repeats that I need. I usually don't write reviews but this one is so worth the effort. I really love all the options available. Other aps who want to be like this one should take their lessons from here.
A12YB84TFROIXH B008Y2FRFO 5 1363046400 51 Very addicting. And wonderfully contageous. Here's a household hint: if you don't want to do a cleaning job at home hand this game to your spouse so they won't notice the mess. OR get so involved in this game and you can simply ignore everything around you. Works for me!! ;)
A12YB84TFROIXH B00AQ5KYVE 5 1368316800 104 Oh I love this app. It has taken all the fight and arguments out of my relationship between my 9 year old and me. Having the things I expect from him spelled out in a list and having the rewards as a visible goal really causes him to want to do his best. I even cheated and added myself to the list so that I can become more disciplined in my own life. I really love the ability to modify and customize this app for multile people. I also like the idea of focusing on the rewards rather than the punishments. Very cool app.
A12YB84TFROIXH B008IJTFYW 5 1364688000 99 I got this app out of simple curiosity. I kept because of its usefulness and  variety. It's very entertaining as well. I don't always use it for meditation. I use it also as background noise to block other noises. I like how I can create and save my own sounds or I can create new ones as the mood hits. I have dyslexia and being able to distract my ears while doing other things helps me keep my mind on task. It's very helpful with things like reading and sewing. I really love this app. Thanks for creating it!
A12YB84TFROIXH B00785P2QC 5 1370476800 29 The only thing I have against the game is that my son loves it so much is that he's always borrowing my kindle fire when I want it. LOL
A12YGP9LTDSD93 B004YWUV40 4 1320192000 40 I like this app however I did not give it 5 stars cuz I wish it gave the option to speed up the &quot;melting&quot; of the android guy. seems to go really slow. other then that its a cool background.
A12YGP9LTDSD93 B006OC2ANS 2 1330214400 20 This game is free because of the questionable permissions. Location and accounts are the specific ones that bother me. word
A12YGP9LTDSD93 B005DTZAZS 2 1341878400 43 As stated before, this game is in serious need of a tutorial or some form of direction. I'm still not sure what the point is. Fly around and blow stuff up? seems to work well although the controls can seem a but clunky.
A12YHGGJSQ4JK B008OD6QYE 5 1349740800 41 it is sooooooooooo addicting and fun I play it constantly! so much that I have callusses on my index finger! great fun for all ages!!!! it is simply outrageous that it is free take advantage of this great deal my friend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A12YHGGJSQ4JK B00992CF6W 1 1349827200 58 I just don't get the huge racket over this dumb game it costs you about 7 whole bucks!!who in their right mind would do that?! basically all you do is build and fend off creepers!!!!!! I certainley wouldn't do it and you shouldn't either it is the ultimate game of DUMBNESS!!!!!!!! Ps. it is 24 bucks on computer
A12YHGGJSQ4JK B007OXASB2 1 1350000000 43 this game suckers you into buying gems which cost like 10$ for 20 gems! I got a really cute kitten but it was sick.and it gives you the choice of healing it or ABANDONING it for free! this game is appalling and SAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A12YIKFBIBEKOI B0064X7B4A 5 1390953600 43 My daughters got me hooked on this game and now we share back and forth.  It also allows you to text back and forth keeping us in touch as well as enjoying the challenges of the game.  I highly recommend this fun app.
A12YIKFBIBEKOI B00DZYXTRY 4 1390953600 21 We have fun playing with the grandkids; they are really good at it -- grandma/pa not so much.  Fun learning tool.
A12YIKFBIBEKOI B0069F2RCE 1 1390953600 26 Installed and uninstalled immediately.  I can't really give a review since I just feel it wasn't for me and it would be unfair to review it.
A12YIKFBIBEKOI B00C149WAM 1 1390953600 21 I was immediately disappointed in this app and immediately deleted it.  I guess it just wasn't my thing. Sorry about that.
A12YL34M9M3OFM B00AEJM6H2 5 1364774400 32 I had been playing regular jewel and thought that was fun.This game got me hooked right away. I still haven't. figured out. all the tricks but it does. make time go by
A12YL34M9M3OFM B008B84O6Y 3 1374192000 31 it still has a lot of glitches. continues to close in middel of play or Just stops. working. this could be a 5 star if they fix problems.  also slow running
A12YL34M9M3OFM B00D5YT6IA 4 1377216000 20 starts out easy. but get better as you play. reaction time a little slow. Helps with my spelling as well
A12YL3GRVJ75JC B00821NZ74 3 1345420800 56 It wasn't very fun at first cause everything was so exspensive! And I didn't have much patience for it either. But as you go along in the game it gets more fun as u get more stuff because after u buy the bed, computer, desk, chair, and nihhtstand, everything is only 150 at the most :)
A12YL3GRVJ75JC B0086700CM 4 1339372800 49 Ok don't get me wrong this game is amazing and super addicting and fun. But on the Kindle Fire, It freezes as u go on, and if u try to jump or duck, sometimes it wont let u and u die. Plz fix this!!! Overall, though, its great :)
A12YL3GRVJ75JC B00ASSF19Y 5 1357430400 25 I had to review tthus game to get the full version,but its a good app, I got it for my cousin and she loves it
A12YL3GRVJ75JC B008GTV9DO 3 1343088000 72 I like this app, its very fun and easy to play, but..... I've noticed that no matter who is playing, Player 1 ALWAYS loses. If I play as Player 1 I have no hope in winning , but if I'm another player I win every time. Everyone who has this app that I know expeirences these same problems, and it is kind of making the game not so fun. Please Fix This!!!!!
A12YLFDTBXU7Q0 B007V2UGPE 4 1361923200 25 the graphics are great i think something that could help out is makin it easier to get gold coins besides that everything else is great
A12YLFDTBXU7Q0 B009G9KFQ0 5 1364083200 21 this app gives you everything you need to know about the wheather everywhere theres alot of options to look at also
A12YLFDTBXU7Q0 B009UX2YAC 5 1365120000 47 This game is the best game I've played on my kindle yet I've played other games like but none compare to this it's very addicting the only thing I don't understand is who ever made the game why they made it so hard to get other characters
A12YLRWHEFFC59 B00E9A656K 5 1384128000 29 This racing game has excellent graphics.  It's multiplayer makes it even better then it already is. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great multyplayer drag racing game.
A12YLRWHEFFC59 B008JK6W5K 5 1359676800 25 It is great especially when you know that logo. It is very fun for me. It is challenging but that is what makes it fun.
A12YM9TFQRMHV6 B004SOR4H6 4 1395878400 20 Wonderfull, nice application, easy to opperate, just a little small the letters for me but nice in general,, recomended 100%
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B0063GORYU 4 1325980800 29 This version trys to do too much for the player.  It moves the cards to spaces, but not always where the player wants.Other than that it's a great game.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B006GIX2MI 5 1352160000 111 This brings back memories of my Economics class where we built a fictional city, which turned out to be New Orleans.  Only it was more logistical being about industrial, residential and other areas making the city run more efficiently.It's quite advanced, but children in middle school and even adults will find it fun and challenging and fun.It's a great amazon game and doesn't dictate where things have to be placed but does give helpful hints along the way so you're not left scratching your head trying to guess what to do next.For the price, it's full of interesting adventures and fun. You find yourself learning a lot without cracking a book.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B004XJKUJ0 5 1330041600 41 Reading these scriptures helps to improve my mood and outlook as I start my day.They also helps to remind me that I have the spirit of the lord with me and I'm not alone as I face the challenges of life.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B0060D80NU 5 1344729600 29 The game is easy to learn and fun to play.  A great way to spend time in your own little paradise away from the stress of the real world.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B0063GSL60 5 1325635200 26 A great game! Helps pass time and keeps the mind active. One of the best down loads I've made. Keeps the kids quiet on road trips.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B00881VLCE 5 1380412800 188 Growing up, putting puzzles together was a family thing.  We would put the puzzle on the coffee table and begin by putting the boarder together, even the little ones would help with that.  Then, on our way through the house, we would stop and see if we could put in a piece or two, then go on with what we were doing.If we had a little time to kill, we would sit on the couch and sort out some pieces by color and work in as much as we could.With magic puzzle you have many puzzles to choose from.  After choosing the puzzle, you have the ability to make it easy, for the younger ones or harder for the more experienced.  You can also make the pieces spin or not.  Spinning makes it more like the real thing, not only deciding where it goes but whether it's upside down or sideways.Then, just when you have solved them all, you can choose a new topic-pack to add all with the same choices easy, hard or rotating or not.  Giving you and your family and friends hours of puzzle fun.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B007ZGO7EM 5 1398470400 74 I have tried several calculator Apps and this is the best of all of them.  Plus it has large enough buttons that I don't have to put my glasses on to see them, when I want perform some quick calculations.  Also, my big fingers can hit the key I want without overlapping neighboring keys and possibly enter the wrong number.I cannot think of any changes the developers should make, they did this one right.
A12YNQOHV7PTWR B005HFNA4Q 5 1331769600 51 These passages are quick and easy to read, they only take. a minute or two to read but help to lift the spirit all through the day.Everyone should add these apps since they are free, but do a million dollars worth of good for your outlook on dealing with life's problems.
A12YOS5H7PU4IP B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393545600 30 Omg this is such a hard game but gets you on the edge of your seat and keeps you motivated so fun and amazing you will like it trust me
A12YOS5H7PU4IP B00DJFIMW6 5 1373414400 22 I love this game it is so fun and it is a little slow sometimes but it doesn't matter it is amazing
A12YOS5H7PU4IP B0054JZC6E 5 1355011200 37 I love this game It is so awesome and I think you should buy it if you are intrasted in this game I just adore it when it came In the app store I was so excited

A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004N8KDNY 1 1329004800 134 How is it possible to have ZERO permissions listed in the app's desription (Product Details), when the app includes Open Feint?  Is this an Amazon oversight or an intentional omission by the developer?  Regardless, seems like it would be Amazon's responsibility to read what the developer has submitted as the app's description and then make sure the developer lists permissions that are clearly needed for the app to function according to its claims in the gameplay description.In any event, I'm surely not going to download this just to see if the installation asks for such permissions right before the install.  So if anyone who has such knowledge about what the app asks for when installing, if anything, cares to share that with the rest of us, I'm sure it would be appreciated by all.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0073LWDZ4 1 1328313600 49 Why developers think including Feint and Leaderboards in the app is going to help make it the next greatest app is beyond me. Historically, it just turns people off, having the opposite effect.  Take a clue from Angry Birds (paid) ad-free:  Only permission required is open network sockets, PERIOD.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B005SJTLUS 1 1322524800 517 ***UPDATE:  THIS APP IS NOT "FIXED."  HE TOOK OUT SOME, NOT ALL.  THE DEBUGGING CODE IS STILL THERE.....***_______________________________________________________________________________________________________They want thumnails of current and recent tasks I've performed on my phone??? Are they SERIOUS???  I wouldn't even agree to that on a FREE app!  I expect to look out for this on some of the shadier FREE apps that are also sweeping up your privacy with their ads as well... but sneaking this permission inside of a PAID app is DOUBLE DIPPING!  I don't even know why it's a 2-star app yet from the other 43 reviewers, but if it's related to the game itself, this app becomes a DOUBLE DOG!!!AND.....  Do you know who developed this, but under the new/different DD name? The old Gamecock developer dude! The G.O.D. indie developers guy! The STONER, star and producer of Austin High!! The guy who is looking to buy a gaming magazine and needs our info!! THIS GUY HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE YEAR OF THE FLOOD - HE DOESN'T "MAKE MISTAKES" LOLOLOL!!!! Well, in all fairness, the only MISTAKE HE DID MAKE was underestimating AMAZON CUSTOMERS' INTELLIGENCE! Look at his app's rating on the Android Market.... 4 stars! He thought THAT'S what he'd get HERE! There are zillions of teenyboppers and teens on the Market over there downloading all their FREE STUFF, so he thought he'd try to pull that crap over HERE unsuspectingly! KIDS don't look at permissions.... nor do they CARE! It's their PARENT'S PROBLEM if the phone gets wacked... they couldn't care LESS! So over there, on the Market, it's rated 4-ish stars for its ENTERTAINMENT VALUE to the kids, and whether it actually "just works" on the phone. BUT OVER HERE?..... ON AMAZON??..... we have CREDIT CARDS ON FILE.... SOMETHING THE TEENS AND PRE-TEENS DIDN'T GET FROM THEIR PARENTS TO GET ON THE ANDROID MARKET..... AND WE CARE ABOUT OUR PHONES AND OUR PRIVACY, UNLIKE ALL THE KIDS! So NOW he DIDN'T EXPECT THIS APP TO CRASH AND BURN LIKE IT DID TODAY? SO WHAT DOES THAT CLOWN DO???? HE SAYS OH CRAP, I DIDN'T GET AWAY WITH "PAYING MYSELF" (in data-mining dollars!!) for the app I'm giving away FREE today, they caught me! They're TOO SMART over there on Amazon.... so NOW I NEED TO HAVE SOME DAMAGE CONTROL! I'LL TAKE IT OUT NOW AND TRY TO RESURRECT WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THE SMOKE AND ASHES MY APP HAS BECOME ON AMAZON..... and, then, yeah, I'll say it was an OVERSIGHT..... A MISTAKE..... we left it there from the testing stage, or whatever crap he tried to cover his azz with...... A GUY LIKE THAT DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES of THAT MAGNITUDE! YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW IT'S A LIE??????? IT'S THE SAME EXACT WAY WITH THE SAME PERMISSIONS OVER ON THE ANDROID MARKET!! LOLOL Is THAT A MISTAKE, TOO????? How long has THAT MISTAKE been over THERE??? Stay away from this developer! I guarantee you... he'll try to UPDATE this app for you in the future, and try to include the permission AGAIN and slip it through! THAT'S JUST THE WAY SNAKES ARE!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006RXD2I6 5 1330732800 1318 Sure, we all know that MobilityWare recently added the most OBNOXIOUSLY INTRUSIVE full-screen video ads in their ever-popular Solitaire app.  I'm willing to put up with an ad bar in a free app.  But commercials of the Charmin Toilet Paper bears shaking their toilet-paper-ball-ridden rears in my face, when all I wanted to do was play a round of Solitaire? Or a totally inappropriate-for-children movie trailer instantly popping up, taking over the whole screen, and requiring interaction with the screen to get RID of it? If you have children using that app, you should be saying "NO WAY!"  If you don't have an unlimited data plan, I'm sure you didn't intend for that app to be racking up the usage of data you so diligently try to save in that disgraceful manner.  Hey, I have UNLIMITED data, so that's not a factor.... and I'm STILL annoyed!!!!But I digress..... The good news is:  Along comes 250+ Solitaire Collection!!  Yes, it's a FREE app, ad-supported, and requires the following permissions:* Write to external storage.* Open network sockets.* Achieve low-level access to setting the orientation (actually rotation) of the screen.* PowerManager WakeLocks to keep processor from sleeping or screen from dimming.* Access information about networks.Sure, it would be great to get rid of them -- but for a FREE app, this is pretty much not unexpected for something that has an ad bar (and ONLY an ad bar as of this writing) as a way for people to "pay" for an app they got for free.  It includes AdMob, and that's it... one the most popular advertising ad-ons used in a free app (and ridiculously in some paid apps as well).  I can LIVE with AdMob.  The ad bar is at the top, and definitely doesn't bother me, and definitely doesn't show a splash screen between games or upon launching.There are TONS of different solitaire games on this app (250+ to be exact!), including the standard Klondike version that is the ONLY one included in the MobilityWare app.  What's BETTER about this app, as compared to the MobilityWare Solitaire app, is that THIS ONE is sooooo totally customizable.The background.... you can use their colors or even YOUR wallpaper.  And the backs of the cards? ANY wallpaper or photo can be used as the picture on the back of your mini cards... totally AWESOME feature!!!  I tried it out with a quick picture of Goofy I had handy, and it centered his face perfectly, even with the border I added, even though I half expected it to come out totally cockeyed. Amazing!Having 250+ games is not laborious to categorize, either.  It's pretty much already done FOR you!  It comes with a Favorites sorter, a "Games Tree" (totally cool, sorted by "type" of solitaire), and a Games List (all alphabetical for easy finding of something you already know what you're looking for).OPTIONS:The options include mirror layout (reverse the layout of what you see on the screen, should you prefer), animations enabling/disabling, animations of the card dealing (enable/disable), hiding the size of the pack (a little number on the back of the card pile can show you, if you prefer, how many cards are left to sift through (a helpful feature), hiding the count of the redeal, the ability to move the card just by TAPPING the card (like MobilityWare solitaire!) or NOT have that feature (what you prefer), autoplay (on/off/to collect all cards) that helps you with automatically making moves that are possible and to collect the cards at the end when you won and don't want to manually tap them all), screen orientation (default/portrait/landscape/by sensor), landscape toolbard orientation (the location of it being on the left or right side), sounds of the cards moving/shuffling (on/off), sound level for the app, a totally cool "victory" sound (an "applause" played, that comes with the app, or pick any other sound/song on your phone!), ability to automatically backup your statistics on the SD card, manual statistics backup, and even restore statistics. Also has "click on game item" choice of it being to show the game menu or to start the game.Does the selection of options get ANY BETTER THAN THIS?!?!  Yes...it does!!Choosing the "appearance" option lets you pick any photo or wallpaper you like from your phone, and use THAT for the actual BACKGROUND for the game.  So many people have so many preferences (too light, too dark, too patterny, etc., etc.), and this takes care of ALL those problems.  Heck, it even lets you change the color of the TOOLBARS... first toolbar, second toolbar, the fill pattern in portrait, first toolbar in landscape, second toolbar in landscape, toolbar fill pattern in landscape, TEXT color of the toolbar button, text color of the disabled toolbar button, the first and second colors of the pressed button, and the pressed button fill patterns in both portrait and landscape orientations.Wow, couldn't be better if you wrote the app yourself, right? Wrong! There's even MORE.....The CARDS themselves:  You can change the VALUE FONT (numbers on the cards) between a few other choices, the SIZE of the value font, previewing the cards (small or normal).  And don't forget the backs of the cards already mentioned... how lovely the deck of cards would be with your child's face on every one of them.... or your company logo.... national flag.... or even that picture of your boss with the bullet holes in his face.... ALL of them are candidates for this feature!One more thing... this app not only gives you written descriptions on how to play all the games... but DEMOS of how they work.... sort of like mini PowerPoint presentations (without sound) that show the cards moving in action!And of course, adding all these features would mean nothing without mentioning they DO take care of the basic mandatories you're probably looking for while playing the actual game:  Undo, Redo, Move (collect all cards after winning, setting a bookmark, and the AVAILABLE MOVES YOU CAN MAKE if you get stuck), and clicking "Game" lets you start a new game, restart the game, or show you the statistics you racked up.There's also an option to check into "HeyZap" (the social discovery platform for android), if you're into that sort of thing.... but it's not FORCED, and neither does the app nag or even ask you to check in at any time. If YOU want it, YOU go into the options menu and click it.  Simple as that.If you're fed up with the LIMITATIONS of gameplay that MobilityWare Solitaire app has... and want customizations that will blow you away.... And CLEAR, SHARP, LARGE CARDS, that YOU design with all those options.... then THIS IS THE APP YOU'RE LOOKING FOR to replace that MobilityWare app that most people download.  And why do they download it?  I'm now suspecting it's because of 1) it's claims to be the clearest and easiest on the eyes, and 2) thousands of other did, so follow the crowd.  Look, I've downloaded both.... and even without customizations at first, the FIRST THING I noticed in 250+ was that the cards were LARGER and CLEARER than the other app, although I certainly wasn't expecting that after reading the false claims (and believing them) by MobilityWare!!!This is one app I SURE WOULD PAY FOR if there were an ad-free version -- absolutely!  It's TOTALLY OBVIOUS this developer spent a lot of time to make this app work the way it does, and to pack the punch that it does.  AND I LOVE IT!Alexi Anoshenko is the brilliant developer of this app -- and it's his ONLY APP, on Amazon OR the Google Market.  I'm baffled by this! Alexi, it's a WONDERFUL APP!  People would PAY for an ad-free version of this!  Get one out there, pronto!  And I'm secretly hoping the reason you HAVEN'T thus far is because you're busy working on some MORE of these killer apps for us to enjoy!!!  BRAVO!!!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0063GORYU 1 1330041600 40 Don't bother with this app unless you're into Charmin toilet paper commercials and movie trailers popping up and opening your web browser to do it!  Totally over the top unacceptable!!  MobilityWare apps all suck now and all have this crap!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004WOXGCO 1 1332028800 1950 Can't believe I got woken up by a phone call at the crack of noon, no less on the day after attending a St. Patty's party, from a friend whining to me to review the FAOTD before they download it.  After I had my coffee and a packet of Goody's powder, I became even MORE irritated when the slits of my eyes saw the big cow nostrils on the icon that belongs to an app that has a reputation I'm already familiar with.  And it's NOT a good one.FIRST, THIS REALLY NEEDS TO BE SAID:  Do you REALLY want to download an app from a developer who says THIS in the opening sentence of the description of his app over on the "other market" (Moola Free):"Ignore the nay sayers, try the app for yourself FREE!" (pause for effect....)It is a free app designed to allow folks to try the app before paying for it because "nay sayers" are saying don't download his paid app.  Think about that for a few seconds and see if you have the same trouble I'm having digesting that chunk of cement.The developer needs to make a choice as to whether he wants his app to be his version of an Intuit/Quicken-type app, or a Mint/Pageonce-type app.  Because it's really not close to either at this point.  The problem here is that he's not fully describing exactly what it is that the app does and doesn't do.  People are not clear on the fact that you don't need to put in your bank account numbers because it doesn't go to the internet for anything! (YET???)  Where it says bank account information, I'm sure you can put in "Fred's Checking" or something like that.  It may have fields for this information, but you definitely don't have to put in the correct numbers or full numbers for anything (and nor do I suggest that!)  The app description reads as if "everything is going to be taken care of for you" and you can get up-to-date accurate information at your fingertips.  But he neglects to really put the due emphasis on the fact that it's YOU that input that data into this app.  It's narrative is reading more like a Mint dream come true, but it's really an empty shell like Quicken, waiting for you to tell it every financial transaction you made.  I heard there is an import function for csv files, etc., but my experience with those has been LESS than satisfactory (I reviewed a similar app and csv import limitations not too long ago).  So, what's wrong with being an empty Quicken-ish wannabe app?  Well....it's a HORRIBLE Quicken-ish wannabe app, to be perfectly blunt about it.The app makes a lot of claims as to what it can DO... *sigh*.... but the problem is that it doesn't DO them.  What the developer has to understand is that you get a better reputation if you design the app, test it, and then market and sell it.  What seems to be going on here is that the developer had a "somewhat halfway decent and functioning" app, and then decided to play Frankenstein with the app (that people already purchased and relied on!).  There were way too many additions, deletions, and changes to the point where the app was just ONE BIG BUGGY MESS (to put it mildly).  This is a FINANCE app, not a tower defense game.  If you lose your points in the latter, you're a little ticked off.  But EATING someone's financial data they took the time to create?  Or having buttons that don't work for them to ACCESS it at all?  Having the problems become so pervasive that the good intentions of trying to fix the problems as they arise became an impossible task?  Then trying to update the app to fix things that only cause MORE bugs and problems with the app?  This is what thousands of people are angry about.  If they got it for free, I'd have to say "live and learn, you get what you pay for, or look for a reliable free app, they're out there..."  But this was an 8 DOLLAR APP.  THEY ARE JUSTIFIED.Let's look at another issue that is disturbing.  This app, just a few months ago, was renamed to EasyCheckBook.  Okay, what's wrong with that, you might say.  Well, nothing, except the developer renamed it and didn't tell his customers who already bought and were using the app!  They woke up one day to find the icon missing on their phones, just obliterated, poof!  Unless these folks had "automatic updating" on for their phones for the app to update itself (NEVER RECOMMENDED and hardly ever used by folks!), their app and all their financial data was GONE.  You would think the developer who wants PERMISSION to access ALL....not ONE, the one you're currently using... but ALL the email addresses associated with your phone would DROP YOU A FRIENDLY LINE ABOUT THIS AND GIVE YOU A HEADS UP?  Now, if he wants THAT permission, all your emails, what is it for?  Well, it SURE wasn't to notify all the customers that their app and their data had been smoked off the face of their phone while they were sleeping!  Did the developer think/hope/(know?) that most people who bought it didn't use it, so they wouldn't "miss" it if he slipped it off their phones on the middle of the night? ... and then mistakeningly download and pay AGAIN for the new EasyCheckBook in the future, not realizing it was an app they PAID for in the past, only it's wearing a mask?  To make a long story short(er), the facelift didn't "take" for the most part, and the demand for the cow icon's return won out.  I'll just cock my eyebrow on that one and leave it to your good senses to wonder what YOU would do had you paid for something the developer hoped you didn't notice was erased from your phone.Onto the permissions....I'm not sure the developer has a handle on developing a stable app yet.  I think this is still a learning curve for him in the field of app development.  And you're the test market.  I'm not even sure he knows what is NECESSARY or not for his own app to function.However, he DOES know some basic things... like what to put in his FREE app... you know, the one I mentioned earlier.... the one he puts out there for no charge to try to get you to buy the PAID version.  This is a clipped list of permissions in the FREE one on the "other market" (there is no "free" version on Amazon):* Network communicationfull Internet accessAllows an application to create network sockets.* Phone callsread phone state and identityAllows the application to access the phone features of the device. An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of this phone, whether a call is active, the number that call is connected to and the like.* Storagemodify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contentsAllows an application to write to the USB storage. Allows an application to write to the SD card.* Your accountsdiscover known accountsAllows an application to get the list of accounts known by the device.* Hardware controlscontrol vibratorAllows the application to control the vibrator.* Network communicationview network stateAllows an application to view the state of all networks.* System toolsautomatically start at bootAllows an application to have itself started as soon as the system has finished booting. This can make it take longer to start the device and allow the application to slow down the overall device by always running.* Defaultdisable or modify status barAllows application to disable the status bar or add and remove system icons.Aha!  He DOES know what he should put in the free app... but I thought it was to get people to buy the PAID version?  Wouldn't you think he would put out a "demo" version with all the features, but for a limited time to try all the features out?  No, he put out some sort of limited functionality version, where people couldn't even try the features you want them to BUY (and that people are complaining about!).  Doesn't make sense to me.... just try out "some features" and then you'll see that the "nay sayers" were wrong?  The naysayers are complaining about a LOT more than a few basic features you're willing to let them tinker with.  A full-version, limited-time demo or something like that would have been much better.  Or maybe not, seeing as how there were more bugs than working features!I'm not going to backhoe the rootball of all the very (unfortunately) VALID comments made by the posters this morning.  They're all TRUE.  This is normally a $7.99 app.  Some deal must have been struck to offer it here for less, $5.99, but today it's free.  All the permissions you see here today (Mar. 18, 2012) are exactly the same as what's contained in other PAID versions of this app on the "other market."Yes, I have problems with the permissions in this app... some are not necessary, and that's already been covered by other posters quite well.  But I also have a problem wondering why they were included when INTERNET ACCESS was NOT included (in the paid version).  Can't even imagine why the developer needs all your email address associated with your device.  He wants the "Phone state and ID" (your phone number, etc.) in the FREE version, the one with internet access.  So, what is he doing with that? What IS the purpose of the free version with those permissions?  It says nothing about "ad-supported" in the description... maybe there ARE ads, but who knows about that or what else is in the app (I'm sure not downloading it to prove a point, because there is SOMETHING there to make him put the internet access and phone ID information in for!).  Maybe there ARE full-blown adds in the free one, but he didn't mention that.  He has to decide if the free version is to make money off the private data he gets OR to introduce us to a "Lite" version of THIS full-featured one.The way the customers have essentially been the guinea pigs in his test lab for the past year or so, suffering and providing him feedback on what working and what's not, I'd say he's better off making the free one a data mining app and leaving it that way!  Because if THAT was designed to introduce the public to how THIS PAID APP functions, with ALL ITS INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PAST AND PRESENT BUGS..... he is NEVER going to get rich off ANY of these Moola apps (or whatever other stealth names he wants to give it in the future).My advice to HIM, should he be willing to take it, is to spend time fixing the app, and test and re-test and triple-test it, and stop updating this thing every time there's a new moon.  You might have a dark horse in the finance apps race... but don't USE THE CUSTOMERS as the trial audience for an 8 DOLLAR PAID APP!My advice to DOWNLOADERS would be to either forget it, or download and leave it in the cloud to see what happens.  But no doubt the developer KNOWS you'll be doing that and might AGAIN retire this app's name and re-market a totally NEW one (that you have to PAY for again) should any improvements actually create and app that WORKS!  And lastly, if you decide to go with this app and you EVER see internet access added in one the many updates to this thing, then I suggest you uninstall this cowpie YESTERDAY.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0067Q42BY 1 1329609600 215 The only benefit for the open network sockets permission is so that the developer can annoy you with splash ads for their other products.  That doesn't belong in a $5 app, or ANY paid app.  The reason to pay for an app in the first place is to AVOID those types of annoyances and intrusions.  The developer should have just put a button in a settings menu reading "Our other apps," and that would have been fine.  But every time you open the app, you get splash screens for their products before you are permitted to continue.  That's the behavior one would expect from a free, ad-supported app, not a premium $5 product.Why a developer would shoot himself in the foot by advertising his products this way to those who PAID him a fee is beyond me.  Guess he thought his paying customers would only get angry AFTER they paid, and by then, he wouldn't care.  At least today as the FAOTD, those who wanted to try it out don't have to pay and be scammed by this greed, and they definitely are now alerted as to what to expect in those other paid products he wants you to buy.  Putting up with that tutorial in the app is just adding fuel to the fire.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004GJDQT8 1 1321401600 350 Since I can't find a place to review the Amazon Appstore app, I'm wondering if this app has similar features.  Does it show up as a little blue icon in your taskbar every couple of hours saying there are updates to it, or other things you buy with it? The Appstore app does that, with the orange icon showing up several times a day "asking" you if you would like to update it.  Soon as you clear it out, it comes back a couple of hours later.  Also, the apps you download have updates (however major or minor), and every time an app has an update (that you either want or don't want), the Amazon icon pops up on my phone telling me there is an update waiting.  Also, I don't download updates as soon as they come out for ANYTHING and instead wait until I see how the reviews are for that update so I don't make a hasty mistake and can keep the old one if it's better or I'm waiting for a fix.  So, until that time, I am bombarded with reminders from Amazon on the main screen of my phone with NO ABILTIY TO TURN OFF THESE ANNOYING ALERTS. I already have this blue Amazon app on my phone, but I am very hesitant in even opening it until I find out whether this app ALSO has the INABILITY TO TURN OFF THE INCESSANT ALERTS.  I will just keep looking at reviews before I find a satisfactory answer.  I already emailed Amazon about the Appstore app problems (last major update to it was just 2 days ago), and they pretty much sent me a generic email saying "at this time, it's not a feature..." so I don't want to waste my time with Amazon again on asking about THIS app, and trust that other customers will give me the skinny on how this app functions.  As it stands now, the ratings are poor, but I really want to find out about how much they alert/contact you and whether Amazon let's you control these alerts.  Thank you.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004WPG1A2 1 1321142400 294 It always amuses me how some people put the blame on an app force closing on the PHONE.  If an app doesnt work on a major brand of a late model phone like the Droid x2, it is not the fault of the phone.  It disgusts me to see so many FAOTD apps have force closing as an issue. Why?  Its representative of the results people are getting and paying for in the entire app market.  Developers are too quick to market apps without proper testing. I mean, just run a short pilot of the app to users with various phones to see if it works first! How hard can that be? Line up friends and family and others you know who each have different makes and brands and do a test run! Theres plenty of people out there who would love to test apps before hitting the market. Then when you see that a few people who have Motorola phones are force closing, go FIX THE PROBLEM or have the decency to put a note in the description that it doesnt work with that brand! Because not doing this implies your app was designed to work on ALL android phones with a reasonably late model tag! And test it on froyo and gingerbread since you know THOSE ARE THE CUSTOMERS YOU ARE MARKETING TO AND TRYING TO GET PAID FROM! PS:  I dont have a Motorola NOR have I downloaded this app.  If 50 people buy milk from a store on Oak Street 3 miles away and complain that its all sour, I dont need to guzzle down a glass myself from the same store on MY street before I am allowed to render an opinion on the careless practices of the proprietor.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004L07KWQ 4 1319932800 78 Its a cute app to have handy to draw things when you have to kill a few mins with a child that needs to sit still.  Better yet, we use it for writing spelling words in pretty colors to keep the childs attention and make the app semi educational.  Works every time, bec the child becomes engaged in not knowing what color will come out next.  It works flawlessly with no lag or problems, so its a keeper.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004XMWJIC 5 1330300800 309 The app was advertised as a basic whiteboard app with some extra functions, and that't EXACTLY what it does.  It's a whiteboard screen, the markers are the 4 basic colors you find in whiteboard marker sets, has some cute extras like shapes and marker thickness choices, and the ability to share the creation via a number of methods...  WITHOUT INTERNET ACCESS PERMISSION.No, it's NOT a drawing app... not a painting app... not an app intended for children/adult to create artistic masterpieces of any kind.... it's a mini version of a WHITEBOARD, and does what WHITEBOARDS DO.  No glitches of any kind.  The 4 colored markers (red, black, blue, and green) are exactly what are used on whiteboards 99% of the time, and having those 4 traditional colors, in my opinion, only adds to the charm of this cute little diddy of an app.  There are other whiteboard-only apps out there, perhaps with other functions, but is the price you pay for them worth the extra junk/permissions and data mining analytics you get along with them? You can make that decision yourself, but my opinion is NO.  It's a whiteboard that acts like a whiteboard and RESPECTS YOUR PRIVACY.If you aren't looking for a whiteboard with a few neat extras, it's not for you.  If you ARE, this is a PERFECT place to start downloading it as the FAOTD.  If you missed the opportunity, it's worth the lousy 99 cents this dev is asking for the work he put into the app AND the respect he had to create what you may need without picking your back pocket for extras in the form of your private data.It's quite a feat to get a 5-star rating from me!  But folks....this one is WELL DESERVED.  I will be keeping an eye on this developer for future apps, and so should we all!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0064ETS1I 1 1330473600 277 I'm sure many of you are familiar with the two most recent Maribou FAOTD apps, Dragon Ball and Word Collapse, both of which had no analytics or suspicious permissions of any kind. Sure, the word game took a slight hit due to its inability to move to the external SD card.  But that aside, they seemed to be consistently staying away from adding junk in the trunk of their apps.... and that was a GOOD thing... until NOW.This app today is the FAOTD, and surprisingly, it included analytics, internet access (that Maribou used to stay away from), and even includes autorun/autostart capabilities in this app (and so does the demo version of this app).  Why on earth does a shopping game need THAT?  NONE of their other apps have this... only this Special Edition Made Just for The FAOTD Masses Like You Shopping Game app has this.I used to like where Maribou was, but not where they are now heading.  With some minor tweaking, their apps are surely 5-star contenders if they would just get on the ball and fix them instead of spending their time on the horn with johns like analytic companies discussing how they can begin pimping us out to the highest bidder.Oh.... the game itself was "ok" if you like those build-an-empire-or-city types of games.  I particularly don't, but that wouldn't have stopped me from rating this app highly if it did what it said it would do and did it well.  But autorun, internet, and anlytics added because of the potential download count as FAOTD?  I can't reward that kind of shameful behavior with anything other than the 1 star THAT deserves.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004XNPQUO 1 1330646400 198 Per the description that states sticky (unsecure broadcast) intents are required for Air, is the developer implying one must download the huge-sized Adobe Air onto their devices in order to play this game? If so, it should state that clearly as well and not disguise that requirement in an "explanation" why they "had to" include stickies as a permission.  I believe we've already covered discussions of what sticky intents are in reviews of other apps. If you're unsure of what they are and what they do, search for those discussions in reviews of other recent apps. Basically, stickies are an UNSECURE way of broadcasting data over an internet connection, which this app ALSO wants your permission for.Sticky intents being unsecure, making data available to other apps that may not have a need for that information, as well as the disguised mention of possibly necessitating the download of Adobe Air for this to even run, make this app a bloated risky one that I cannot recommend. The Air issue aside, stickie intents alone make this app something you should never download, and many concerned developers don't even want to include it for that reason. Stay safe out there, people!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004DPIEF6 4 1319932800 73 It really is a hoot when take the phone outside and hold it up and it speaks LAKE, and theres a lake right across the street!  Pointing at my car said OIL!  Then TELL US YOUR NAME said DANNY!  And asking it about its family said SISTER!  Then I was badgering it, and it told me QUIET!  It was enough to scare the beejeebers outta my family!  LOVED IT, especially around Halloween time!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004SDSSFY 1 1321833600 309 UPDATE: Someone already tried downloading this key over the Market version, and THEN tried actually UPDATING it (for the later version) from the Market.  IT FAILED MISERABLY.  So, the jury is still out here with conflicting reports about whether you can even DOWNLOAD it in the first place over the Market version. But if you plan on actually UPDATING it and not getting the error message that it does not recognize the page or whatever that error message said, then you're OUT OF LUCK.__________________________________.........What happpens if you download this key, install it over the Android Market version, and then want to update it? Some are saying their version still says "Android Market" version in the About section in the app. So, from which site - Android or Amazon - will you begin getting your update alerts from?? One?... or both? I dont want to get update alerts every day or see I need to update it on either of my lists FOREVER even though it IS updated.  Will it get confused and recognize neither? If its Market, will they charge you because it wont honor the Amazon full key download?  If Amazon, will having the Market basic version as the 1st download make trouble for future free updates through Amazon?  Anyone know??__________________________________After reading reviews with so many saying you CAN and CAN'T download it over Market versions, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!  Why cant the developer just state in the description that you can install this over ANY prior basic download from ANYWHERE.... or NOT???? Really, just STATE it either way to end this mad confusion and stop the 1-star reviews from getting out of hand!  If it wont work over the market version, then we will KNOW to uninstall it and re-do with both Amazon downloads!  ITS REALLY AS SIMPLE AS THAT!  These little "oversights" arent helping the ratings much!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004SCR8QU 1 1318204800 38 Unfortunately, the app force closes as soon as I tap the small square on the top center, which I assume is to change colors.  I get the one-then-two vibration and then the inevitable force close. App is unusable.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B005J0VPNC 2 1318204800 205 UPDATE:  This app has been hanging in my Update section without installing the updates.  The reason for this is the multitude of comments stating that downloading said update causes you to be unable to get into the app.  I will change the review back to 5 stars if I see the developers description of the app's update includes a fix to this problem, as well as believable customer reviews that reflect the problem has been fixed satisfactorily.  Therefore, 2 stars for the app for at least the old download working, and minus 3 for not having the latest version and hanging around my Update section of the Amazon Appstore app unnecessarily.PRIOR REVIEW:  This is definitely one of my favs!  I took some simple one-click photos right from the app that were probably suitable for framing! (If I can send to laptop and enlarge them).  The photos are THAT GOOD!  Black and white sketches are MUCH BETTER than similar features on desktop apps that distort your face up and put black blobs in some areas. You dont even need to play with those shadow angles like on desktop apps. Im in love with that Bleach feature... its awesome!  Download and see, you will NOT regret! :)
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006QZA1YI 1 1329782400 102 If based on what the developer is saying here, i.e., something will be done to lock out in-app purchases, then it stands to reason it's just as easy to remove all those permissions and make buying the developer's products possible via another method of advertising within the app.  People are not that lazy where they won't purchase other apps just because there's no handy link within the app -- they go right back to the market of their choice, look it up, and download.  The permissions an app harbors should be absolutely NECESSARY for it to operate, not convenient for the DEVELOPER.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004V4IUEE 1 1329696000 43 Actually, it's worse than useless if it doesn't respect the order of operations -- it's HARMFUL if the unsuspecting user is relying on these calculations for classes or business operations.  Needs a MAJOR FIX PRONTO!  If I paid for this, I'd be LIVID.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B005VTS4EY 1 1331337600 454 Free apps with ads coming in over the internet connection?  I get it.  People often PAY for apps with the same gameplay content as their free counterparts to get RID of those intrusions.  This is normally a PAID app, and doesn't have ads.  But it DOES have built-in permissions for your phone's ID and the open network socket through which that information is sent SOMEWHERE.This is just simply double-dipping.  Seems they're asking you folks to pay for an app AND pay them just a little more via giving them information that this app has no business knowing.  Feint was removed in this Amazon version, and we all already know what kind of spyware THAT component is.  But I can't hand out any medals for that decision if OTHER spyware components are still integrated into the app.  Doing so would just be plain silly.Imagine going into a convenience store and buying a bag of chips for a buck and the proprietor says if you want to buy those chips, you first need to open your wallet and let me filter through it to see what's in there so I can judge what you have and where you've been so I can effectively market to you next time you come into the store.  Or asks to rifle through your purse for some data stating what area you live in so they could know who buys their chips and where.  Now imagine further what your face would look like if the gas station owner filtered through your wallet/purse without your knowledge while you used the restroom, and then he shared that information with the Lays Chips delivery guy who was there and was then paid a few bucks for supplying that information to said delivery man.Who thinks they would willingly show their driver's license as a condition to buying a bag of chips?  Perhaps some people might whip it out to get a FREE bag, who knows.  Think about this story next time you're at a convenience store.  What exactly is it that you would buy for a buck or two that required you handing over anything more than the price of what you purchased?What a shame that what looked like a nice a nice little bag of chips for the price comes with the condition of whipping out my ID in order to purchase them.  Maybe the chips aren't that tasty after all if the manufacturer doesn't even think they can stand on their own in order to make a sale.At least today, you didn't have to pay.  But is that really why you came here today?  To download an app that contains what you can expect to get anywhere else in a normally FREE app?
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004SYP5WC 4 1331510400 414 FYI to anyone who downloaded this developer's Easy Money app ($9.95) on 01/19/12, you already have this "app."  All the functions of this app are already included in Easy Money.I'm staring at this app wondering where I've seen it before, and then I recalled the previous FAOTD several weeks ago.  I actually had to delete Easy Money because a) I really didn't use it, and b) It runs all day long with no ability to kill it, keeps coming back, and used quite a bit of RAM while I didn't even have the app open.  I was bothered by that and, well, just like all my RAM available for when I need to open up those "power apps" that need a lot of RAM on the startup without having to go to an app manager to close everything not needed first.In reality, you can't trust android to handle the RAM situation for you perfectly every time, even though it SHOULD and even though it TRIES.  I noticed several times that opening a new app force closed if I used it after having the phone on several hours, but did NOT crash if I was on a fresh reboot and killed unnecessary apps running the background.So, although the app is useful, I'd advise you to go look to see if you installed Easy Money on 01/19/12, and if you did, you not only have THIS app, you have about what the developer feels is about $7.00 worth of even MORE features that you may find useful.  I myself just prefer Mint because I have no intention of taking the time to input anything anywhere if someone else can do it for me and send me alerts on all of it.  But if you have no interest in putting in your bank accounts information or credit card numbers, or even your utilities information, into an app to feel extra secure, this may be a decent substitute.If you go look at Easy Money, and you have no interest in it, and just prefer the smaller selection of features that THIS app provides, then it's a good download for you (especially for free).  If you want more, and think Easy Money may be for you (it just wasn't for me), then go check out what else it provides and see if you're interested .... or just check your phone!  It just may be laying there covered with dust in your app folder if you're a FAOTD frequent flyer!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0063GSL60 1 1330041600 58 MobilityWare now puts full screen video ads on their apps, including this Freecell, Spider solitaire, and regular Solitaire! Right in the middle of your game, and opens your web browser using your data plan and starts running like its commercial time on cable TV!  Charmin toilet paper bears, inappropriate movie trailers, etc.... unacceptable!  TIME TO DUMP MOBILITYWARE PRODUCTS!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006ON41FC 1 1329436800 495 IF YOU WANT TO TRUST OPEN FEINT, FINE.  BUT DON'T COMPLAIN LATER ON!  HERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU TO READ ABOUT WHILE YOU POST COMMENTS ON THE SAINTHOOD OF OPEN FEINT.  ANYONE WHO KNOWS OPEN FEINT FROM GAMING IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THEM.  HAPPY READING TO ALL WHO ALREADY DOWNLOADED IT! :)Apparently, I can't post the site here, it was deleted.  But court house news has it, and other sites.  Go look for yourself.  And it's pretty lame for this app to stop in the middle of gameplay and FORCE all the little 13-year-olds to REVIEW THE APP before they're allowed to continue playing the game.  NO WONDER there is an avalanche of 5 star reviews of little kids squealing with delight over acorns and nuts.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------First, yes.... Open Feint is included in this app, no way to opt out of it.  That alone killed this app.  Developers just don't get the message yet that Feint is poison to an app's rating.I would, however, like to add (for those of you who may not know this) that an app that includes OPTIONAL OPEN FEINT does install the Feint folder onto you device whether you opted in OR out.  That is a whopping 2mb worth of data in that folder.  If you'd like to check for yourself, just go to the FILES folder on your device (the green folder icon).  Open that folder, and you will see all the junk Feint puts into your device EVEN IF YOU DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE.Also, when first downloading/installing/opening an app, Feint may not show itself on the first opening.  Therefore, use the app for about 5 minutes (giving Feint the sneaky chance to load the files through the open network sockets), then CLOSE the app and REBOOT your device.  After rebooting, go back to the app, and open it again.  THEN use the app again for several minutes.  You may notice for the first time (even though it's your second opening of the app) that Feint FINALLY makes its presence known and either 1) asks you to participate ("have fun") OR then loads automatically (as in THIS app).  My point here is that Feint often makes its appearance after the SECOND LAUNCHING of the app, with a reboot of the device in between launchings.If you think you can pull one over on Feint, and "long press/tap" the Feint folder of 2mb and then select delete, you're out of luck.  Because you have permitted open internet as a permission, all those Feint files in the folder will come right back into your device when you launch the app again.  Apparently, Feint knows you deleted it and becomes angry, then reconstitutes itself in retaliation for your efforts to ignore it and its capabilities.Go into your files folder now, and you'll see it there even if you never once selected to participate in Feint.  Then try deleting it, and watch this arrogant social networking component do what it does best:  FORCE ITSELF DOWN YOUR THROAT.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004QOP62S 1 1321142400 457 Some complaints:  FIRST:  Can't be moved TO THE SD CARD!!! This is main reason it's getting ONE STAR FROM ME.  I'm tired of every developer thinking their 2 or 4 or 7 or 10 mb game is the ONLY GAME OR APP WE WILL MAKE THE EXCEPTION FOR BY KEEPING IT AND USING THE PHONE'S SPACE.  NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!  ALL APPS THAT CAN'T SIMPLY MOVE TO THE SD CARD WITHOUT SOME REALLY GOOD REASON (like an antivirus protector) GETS ONE STAR.  And CERTAINLY a GAME that can't be moved surely shouldn't think it's that special and deserved a box seat on our phones!  SECOND:  The color changes are nice, but the SUBMIT button needs to be a different color from the REST OF THE SCREEN, as does the WRENCH button.  We're hitting them very fast and repetitively, so we don't want to have to READ THE WORDS ON THE BUTTONS TO KNOW WHICH WE ARE CLICKING IN A HURRY.  My opinion is SUBMIT should be RED and the WRENCH should be something that stands out, like yellow or black.  THIRD:  What were you thinking by not allowing us to pause in between games before going to the next level? I mean, really, the little pop-up that says "you get to go to the next level," that's it? Soon as I click that the counter starts AGAIN? That pop-up with the words and the definitions covers the WHOLE SCREEN, and we can't even see again the crossed-off list to see what WE PICKED!  Do you think we remember EVERY SINGLE WORD WE TRIED, AND WHETHER WE REMEMBERED TO SELECT THE PLURALS OF THEM OR ADDED ALL THE POSSIBLE PREFIXES/SUFFIXES?  We're moving VERY FAST in this game, and to show us at the end ALL THE WORDS POSSIBLE IN A POP-UP is defeative!  We want the ability to go BACK TO THE CROSSED-OFF LIST TO SEE WHAT WE DIDN'T SELECT!  We don't have time to glance up and study this list AS we are playing!  There are so many little tiny words like "got," "see" "seen" "sees" that we're trying to think of quickly, and although they are part of our vocabulary, we DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE SELECTED THEM during that game!  LET US GO BACK TO THE CROSSED OFF LIST TO SEE WHAT WE MISSED, or at LEAST make the words on YOUR POP-UP a different color IF we didn't select them!  Or put the words we DIDN'T select at the BEGINNING OF THE LIST IN A SEPARTE SECTION! Something!  These changes, combined with MOVING IT TO THE SD CARD would make this game a winner, but as it stands now, it's nothing special and certainly not something that people would recommend others get and PAY for.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004T3K50E 1 1319932800 22 Reading through the instructions, rules, and regulations takes forever!  Who could take the time to memorize all this AND have a LIFE?????
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006OOI008 1 1335312000 136 The developer's intentions for the data collected in this app (and their bubble game as well) are so obvious it's almost laughable that he took out a few in in an attempt to draw attention away from it.  On Google,there are permissions in it that actually say after their explanation "never required by normal apps."  The ability to turn your device on/off whenever they feel like it (to data mine at 3 a.m.)?  Permission to change screen orientation on your device whenever they feel they want control over it?  If I list them all and their associated explanations, it would take 2 hours.This app is the poster child for data mining and developer arrogance.  I don't recall ever seeing one that gets much worse than this.  RUN -- DO NOT WALK -- AWAY FROM THIS APP.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0062OFUNU 1 1332979200 985 I just recently posted a review that I HOPED would have alerted Amazon to some mistakes they have been making by allowing apps to be purchased with permission descriptions that DO NOT MATCH what the customer is being asked to give permission for upon download.  Sadly, Amazon has not learned from that.  The app you are downloading today does not simply have the ONE "open network sockets" permission.  Therefore, I will borrow some text from my previous review on the subject so I don't have to reinvent the wheel in order to alert you to what you can expect with this current app.As stated in my other review, either Amazon, the developer, or both need to get their act together when approving description permissions listed in an app. This is normally a PAID app, and customers who have already paid or will pay for it shouldn't have to find this out AFTER the payment has been made. They need to recognize some folks rely on accurate descriptions before making purchases, and perhaps might not have purchased it at at ALL if the app requests more than what was stated. Surely Amazon should have checked this, and I'm sure the developer knows how the listing was going to read, or at least does NOW and should be contacting Amazon to make the corrections.The current description states it asks for internet access (open network sockets) ONLY.The ACTUAL permissions upon INSTALL are as follows:1)  Network communication (full internet access, the pathway needed to extract #'s 2 and 3 below OFF your phone)2)  Phone calls (read phone state and the phone's unique ID, as well as your phone number)3)  Storage (modify or delete SD card contents, so now the developer can read/write/access all your files on the SD card).Since there is now actual access to the SD, it changes the playing field as to what the open sockets (internet) can collect, added to the phone calls permission listed clearly upon download.  ALL of this is now accessible to this developer, and clearly this app does not need those collective permissions for the app to function.Until the actual permissions are listed correctly and the customers accordingly notified, this is the best I can do in rating an app that hidden permissions undisclosed -- AGAIN.  It also shows whoever is responsible for this -- AGAIN! -- that ACCURATE PERMISSIONS are a serious subject and better attention needs to be paid in listing exactly what was found when the app was TESTED. Amazon:  C'mon! It takes 10 SECONDS to do this!Amazon needs to SERIOUSLY pay attention to this pervasive problem they are having.  If they don't, they're going to wind up with a reputation similar to that of the "other market," where ANYTHING can get uploaded, including viruses, that only get removed from the market only after 50,000 people download, become infected, and the story makes the "national app news of the day."Seriously, Amazon, if you can't take just a few seconds to check what was listed in the app's manifest AND hand that list to the person reponsible for creating the description of permissions for the FAOTD to input it correctly, what other corners are you cutting?  And what ELSE can possibly be in these apps that you are supposedly sending through your "quality control" folks?  Did you not SEE the permissions in the manifest?  Did you (worse) feel we didn't need to KNOW this? Or (even worse) feel that if we DID notice this, we would give a low rating to yet another FAOTD with excessive permissions?  Which is it?Get on the ball, Amazon!  We shop your Appstore because we're under the impression that your apps have to pass more stringent standards -- unlike the Bowery of Google Play apps littered with viruses and trojans -- before you pass them off to your customers.  And CLEARLY, this is now a FALSE sense of security we have.STAY SAFE, FOLKS!  And remember to ALWAYS check your apps' ACTUAL PERMISSIONS asked for after you download, but BEFORE you install!Now...As for the app.... well, if you need to know what's in those fast foods for health/medical reasons and you find yourself with no other choice but to consume SOMETHING on the outside, you might find it useful (or another similar app with fewer permissions, of course).  I find that most restaurants already have a "healthy" or "diet" section on their menus that are a good starting point for those conscious about fat content and calories, etc., but not so much for sugar and other special diets (but they SHOULD!!).  And the decent variety of chicken and shrimp-type salads at fast-food places are a good place to start for the folks on fat/carb/calorie-type diets, should you find yourself in a pinch and need to eat at one of these places, so I don't know that whipping out an app like this one is the ONLY way to "save the day."  I'm pretty sure it's not a good idea to be looking up the statistics of what's in a Big Mac, Quarter Pounder, or french fries in the first place if health or weight is a concern... but it IS a good starting point to become concerned once you SEE it!  I do, however, feel something is needed for the parents of children on special medical diets, and whether it's this app or a similar one, it probably has a very useful function.  But I do feel responsible restaurants should add these things to their menus (for diabetics, etc.) so they don't HAVE to be whipping out an app like this... it should be AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST for ANY items on their menu so folks, and especially parents, can make QUICK intelligent choices for ALL foods sold at that establishment.  And that, TOO, doesn't take much effort or cause financial burden on the part of these multi-million-dollar restaurants.  Restaurants need to get on the ball, TOO!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0061S0A64 1 1334793600 144 Really, Amazon... Your quality control staff as of late is sleeping on the job.  Whatever the reason for stating this app was 7.2 MB but having 25.59 MB downloaded upon the actual install even BEFORE opening it for the first launch is totally inexcusable.  The last uploaded version of the app needs to be CHECKED against the product description you have already written.  WAKE UP, AMAZON.  This issue of product descriptions in MANY respects not matching what you're giving people to download is becoming CHRONIC and HIGHLY IRRITATING.  It makes your customers question what ELSE is in the final versions of the apps they download that you didn't bother to check for.  This app gets one star and won't be re-rated until you fix the inaccurate product description -- that is, IF you ever bother to check it in the future and fix it.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006OQKM6G 1 1332115200 183 Major supermarket chains with ZERO ads available?  There's ALWAYS an ad out, they don't take breaks!  EXTREMELY limited information about stores weekly "specials."  The list of stores in the ones available that have coupons?  Forget it!  Who shops at places called Ralph's and Zoomer Boomer or whatever the heck they're called.  Someone who lives in Gooberville or Mayberry just MAY get lucky with this app.  But what good are the price comparison new features if there's nothing to compare against the PERHAPS one store in your area with bare bones information that doesn't fully match up with the current circular?  Can't believe I let this app stay on my phone for the 10 minutes it took to even browse and rate this data-mining, low-value piece of junk with it's crazy privacy policies.... one that, incidentally, should be renamed to "Loading...10%..."  I told my elderly neighbor I'd find her a shopping app for her first android-based cell phone, but this one is DEFINITELY not going to be on the list!  She's fiesty, and might chase me while wielding a drapery rod if I DO!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B005ZY5U2E 1 1323993600 462 I was SO fully prepared to give this a decent rating.  I played SEVERAL rounds, actually, not just a few.  I initially had no problems playing the Classic, Timed, AND Word Worm levels.  Be aware that BEFORE I even played this game, I used TASK KILLER to close almost everything unecessary to have the most memory available to play this game and give it a fighting chance, as well as used a fresh, full battery.  All was good.... Then I said to myself, "hmmm... I've only been playing this for about 20 minutes, let's give it more time..." and I'm glad I did.  First, I tried to EXIT.  Backspace did NOTHING....just continued to stay at the home screen and spout out the music.  Then I went back to the games, played some more, then used the right-hand button to go back to the home screen to try to exit.... NOTHING.  I clicked my PHONE'S Home button, got there, and used TASK KILLER AGAIN to close this app.  THIS IS WHAT THE DEVELOPER HAD IN MIND FOR USERS TO CLOSE THE APP?  If you are currently having no problems after just a short amount of gameplay, do yourself a favor and trying playing this app for an hour or so to make sure it doesn't fizzle out after semi-extended gameplay.Ok... I reboot, and try again.  THIS TIME I played 2 or 3 short games, and in the middle of selecting a word, it FREEZES UP COMPLETELY just like everyone else here is reporting.  This time, NOTHING would get me back to my phone's HOME SCREEN.  So I do a battery pull, and reboot.  NOW I notice my phone is completely dim, so I check the battery level.... ALMOST ZERO PERCENT.  This app, in less than an hour, SUCKED THE ENTIRE FRESH, NEWLY CHARGED BATTERY in record time, more than I have ever seen any app do ever before.VERDICT:  This app had such GOOD POTENTIAL and was semi-fun to play, but the actual game play was COMPLETELY RUINED by a developer who pushed this app out so prematurely without any refinements at all that it's just...well... unplayable.  And if you can't even play it without it assaulting your phone, it has no worth.  And no worth equals one star, sorry.  This developer is going to have to make a LOT OF CHANGES before this app is usable by the majority of the population and post these changes on the app description before it has a chance of resurrecting itself from the smoldering ashes of one-star reviews.  As for ME, I'll keep it WAY on the back burner and perhaps dust it off and replay it if I see the developer is sincere in trying to improve playability of this app.  If not, it's HISTORY.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0066T0BTO 1 1321401600 195 Wow! Who would have thought the long-awaited sequel to the Great Bejewled would be a DOG.  You would have to be a Bejewled addict to accept ANYTHING the developer throws your way to download and keep THIS.  Wi-fi only??  44 mb??  And explain why it needs the ability to SEND TEXT MESSAGES, when other apps run perfectly fine without that permission. And no Blitz on top of all that? Really, waht was the developer thinking? Like I said, only an addict of the original would download this, and perhaps the developer knew it.... and thats why they threw in the excessive permissions.  The only positive reviews I see are those who are willing to ignore the downsides because theyre getting this as a free app.  How cheap can you be? If you want developers in the future to put more thought into creating an app you are willing to pay for, rate the app fairly by including the wish lists of what you think it SHOULDNT have, and stop drooling and slobbering over the fact that you saved a couple of bucks today in exchange for accepting shoddy caveats that go along with this app.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006PHD0RW 3 1329177600 782 2ND UPDATE:  I did note the developer's comment that Open Feint should "ask" for your participation before the game loads.  So, I uninstalled the app, then reinstalled it.  The Open Feint file on the SD card was deleted along with the uninstall.  I opened the app, and it did not ask me anything about Feint, and I played a game or two.  Then, while the game was still open, I went to my Files Folder.  The Feint folder was there, again with all the junk in it.  I then DELETED the Feint Folder, feeling that if it didn't ask, it sure didn't need the Feint Folder.  I exited the game, then re-entered.  THIS time (again, the SECOND launch of the app), the Feint logo popped up, stating "loading Feint."  It was at this point I realized "loading" meant "putting back all the files  in the folder you deleted," because after clicking "No, I don't want to have any fun" (the Feint decline button), I then was allowed into the game, but went back to the Files Folder, and there again was the Feint folder, loaded once again with all its garbage.  Therefore, this app will not operate without the user allowing Feint to automatically download and keep the 2mb worth of junk files on your phone.  Of note, I DID take this opportunity to try the second way of rotating objects, pressing the item and tapping elsewhere.  This worked a little better than the twisting finger method, which for me hardly worked at all.  The second method, however, worked about 75% of the time, often favoring certain types of taps over others, but I have yet to figure that out exactly.  I probably would have played this game with the second tap method, but Feint repeatedly forcing its files onto the phone of a user that deliberately opted out of Feint on the app is just unforgivable on Feint's part, not the developer.  Now that I fully realize how Feint operates, and that perhaps many developers don't realize what happens with the downloaded files even when their users reject the Feint option, I'm hoping developers that actually know what it does take this into consideration when deciding whether or not to permit Feint to take up some real estate in their app.  I'm putting the review at 3 stars ONLY due to the developer's responsiveness and genuine interest in helping their users.  But I sure hope they consider takiing Feint out in the future, because it would be a much better app without it.1ST UPDATE:  Attempted to try the developer's helpful suggestion on just touching the object and tapping elswhere for an object to rotate, so I REBOOTED (since I only opened the app once after install) to give it a fresh, clean start.  To my surprise, as soon as I opened the app, I got a screen saying "LOADING FEINT."  It hung there for a couple of minutes, so I went to check my FILES folder, and there it was:  the infamous 2mb FEINT FOLDER full of its junk.  It did not ASK me if I wanted to participate in Feint -- it just downloaded it onto my phone upon the second opening of the app.  In all fairness, I tried to ignore the Feint inclusion because I read it was "optional."  This was no option, this was forced into the phone, and I don't care to know if there are settings to combat this because the Feint 2mb file will always install itself if the app doesn't find it there upon launching.  FORCED FEINT IS A DEAL BREAKER.  Therefore, I can not test the workaround to the touch screen issue.  Sorry to have to uninstall what otherwise was an app with great potential.FIRST REVIEW:  This would have been a 5-star app if not for the poor touch screen responsiveness while trying to rotate objects.  If you're lucky enough to get it rotated before placing it in the bag, it turns around all by itself when placing it in the bag, and quickly trying to re-rotate just doesn't work.  Also, as far as I can tell, objects can't be removed from the bag once placed there. You can only adjust what's in there already, but oftentimes it's impossible to do anything to adjust.  You find yourself sitting there waiting for the round to end, or just have to press the "do over" button prematurely.  I was going to give it one star due to it being totally unplayable with these flaws, but I'll hold out awhile to see if the developer improves the rotate function before lopping off another star.  Too bad, seemed like it could be a fun game otherwise.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004RCUJ9E 4 1319932800 71 Nice all around app.  Wish the game colors were a little brighter, though, less muted brown...its harder to see in when lighting is less than optimal. How abt more choices here, including the old fashioned red, black, and white scheme?  I did eventually see the button that permits you to select which color you want to be, so Im changing the review to reflect that and increasing the star rating accordingly.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004UIBIHM 1 1314921600 811 UPDATE ON WHY I DOWNGRADED TO ONE STAR::  The EXPORT CSV FILE feature creates a spreadsheet with the following format for the DATE COLUMN:  "Fri Sep 02 20:21:42 EDT 2011".  Can the developer change this to a NORMAL format that accounting programs recognize, like mm-dd-yyyy???? Presently, all you can do is "open" the csv file it creates, and it will open in Excel, all unformatted and everything, with the following headers on the first line:  category, description, value, and date. Note that the VALUE column is a SHARED column between expenses and incomes.  This causes a huge problem when you try to "import" this csv in a program like, let's say, Easy Cash Manager for the PC.  FIRST, there is NO PROGRAM that will recognize "Tue Aug 11 20:21:42 EDT 2011" as a DATE!!! It just DOESN'T in the world of finance get recognized and CANNOT be imported.  The programs STOP YOU when importing it by saying what format do you want? i.e. mm-dd-yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy. There is NO CHOICE for day of week abbreviated, month spelled out abbreviated, the TIME to the exact second, then EDT or CST, etc., and then finally the YEAR at the end of this long string.  Really, if the developer really wants us to have the ability to save the day of the week and the time of day and what part of the county we live in as data to export, put them in separate columns like notes... but not in the DATE field! It's just not being recognized when you IMPORT the csv into DESKTOP PROGRAMS.  And secondly... this is what happens when the income and expenses SHARE a column: the income for a hundred would be 100, and if it's an expense in the program then it looks like -100 in the column. SO, now the desktop program STOPS ME on EVERY SINGLE LINE OF DATA that it's trying to import and says "Is [CATEGORY] an income or an expense?" as a pop up as it's trying to import them one by one into a desktop program that has the capability of having incomes and expenses share columns or not, your choice when you set it up. BUT, now let's say you open a spreadsheet in Excel with JUST this apps data. You have to add a SUM formula to the last cell in the value column, which will recognize the minus sign in front of a digit as a negative.... but it's all in one column and will be VERY difficult to take the money columns and do anything else with them on the spreadsheet (let's say, each column adds up the negatives, let's you create a new column to add up all your expenses to get a total... or vice versa, all the incomes add up to a figure you can easily recognize as all your incomes for a certain period. It's just now limited in what you can do with that CSV file, because now Easy Cash Manager can't even import this SIMPLE CSV FILE THAT HAS FOUR BASIC CELLS IN IT because of the DATE FORMAT BEING SO WEIRD AND CONTAINING EXTRANEOUS DATA.  The developer HAS TO FIX THIS if they want the csv file to actually IMPORT INTO OTHER PROGRAMS.OLD REVIEW WHEN I UPGRADED FROM TWO TO FOUR STARS:  I'm upgrading my review to 4 stars ONLY because the app is NOW showing a menu that has the export function showing!!!  I had NO menu that wd open when I was in account mode previously (and I pressed it goodness knows how many times in desperation trying to find this apps export feature!  I have downloaded the csv file into Excel..... its basic, just has category, description, value and date as labels in the first row. His wd be a good app if u find a decent MS Excel template for checking accts, etc, and import it in. It is VERY basic, just so u know. And there is nothing u can do with the expense report feature that Im aware of other than view all the withdrawals (???)... or does it selct categories that it considers "expenses" and create the report from those? I dont have but a couple of transactions in my accts yet to be able to make that determination yet. I cant imagine that if I create a "minus" category called "refunds" or "loan" that it shd be included in an Expense report. But since u cant export or print any reports, this feature has serious limited value. Its a good app, and with improvements such as functioning in landscape mode and running total column, and maybe even customizable reports to include only transactions u check off, it wd easily go to 5 stars (especially if able to export a qif Quicken file!!!) For that feature, people would definitely pay for this app!!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B005Z4BGY0 1 1332288000 248 Either Amazon, the developer, or both need to get their act together when approving description permissions listed in an app.  This is normally a PAID app, and customers who have already paid or will pay for it shouldn't have to find this out AFTER the payment has been made.  They need to recognize some folks rely on accurate descriptions before making purchases, and perhaps might not have purchased it at at ALL if the app requests more than what was stated.  Surely Amazon should have checked this, and I'm sure the developer knows how the listing was going to read, or at least does NOW and should be contacting Amazon to make the corrections.The current description states it asks for internet access and network information only.The ACTUAL permissions are read phone state and ID, full internet access, and access to the SD card contents.  Since there is now actual access to the SD, it changes the playing field as to what the open sockets (internet) can collect, added to the phone calls permission listed clearly upon download.I have yet to open and give the game a try, but until the actual permissions are listed correctly and the customers accordingly notified, this is the best I can do in rating an app that hidden permissions undisclosed.  It also shows whoever is responsible for this that ACCURATE PERMISSIONS are a serious subject and better attention needs to be paid in listing exactly what was found when the app was TESTED.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0063IH60K 1 1329523200 64 A full-screen VIDEO commercial for CHARMIN TOILET PAPER when opening the app?  I should never have accepted the recent update!  You would be wise to now UNINSTALL, but first email the developer through the app as to WHY you are doing so.  COMPLETELY AND RIDICULOUSLY UNACCEPTABLE to have movie trailers and commercials in an app!  THIS IS GOING WAAAAAAY TOO FAR!  SCREW THIS!  UNINSTALL!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B007D21OC6 1 1332374400 180 Yes, it's all been said.... STAY AWAY FROM OPEN FEINT!  And I'll jump on this bandwagon and add: What an ARROGANT self-description written by this development company!  Take a look at its GOALS and you'll understand why they employ Open Feint in their 70-apps-and-growing portfolio!I recall months ago saying this about the new crop of Chinese developers who enter the App Business for the sole purpose of data mining and stealing the phone's ID numbers for much later use, while also selling the private data for immediate use.  The phone's ID is very valuable on the black market, and you'll know yours has been sold when you get an $800 cellphone bill next year that includes international calls that you didn't make.... but the CLONED PHONE created using your phone's ID DID.Many Americans have fallen victim to this.  Don't be one of them..... unless you're willing to pay a lawyer over in China $5,000 to file a civil case for you to try to get your $800 back -- AND play a game riddled with a poor excuse for ENGLISH!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B005FNNIAG 2 1316044800 284 Downloaded the app. Love it!  Has some issues with forceclosing after you finish one level and want to go to the next level, but since data was saved upon reloading all over again I was willing to overlook that as a minor inconvenience. So, loved it enough to finish all levels. Then I go to appstore and decide to download Airport Mania Free to see if I liked that version enough to purchase the full version of the &quot;first&quot; Airport Mania series. Hmmm appstore has a button next to A.M. #2 that says &quot;upgrade&quot;. So I click that just to have the latest A.M. 2 on my device. Click it, nothing downloads, and install icon disappears.  Ok, just write that off as a freaky event. Then I click A.M. #1 Free &quot;install&quot; button from search results to begin downloadint THAT game. Starts downloading, stops 1/4 the way and pop-up appears on my phone saying &quot;this download will replace previous version, but all data will be saved... continue?&quot; So I'm confused bec I dont HAVE the A.M. #1 installed!? Why wd it recognize A.M. #2 as the pgm to overwrite with A.M. #1 FREE?? Why shd I allow a free app of game 1 to overwrite a PAID app of game 2?! Now I can't download A.M. #1??? I'm sure as heck not going to pay for game 1 if free version of it wants to overwrite my PAID version of game 2!! RIDICULOUS! Guess thats the end of A.M. for ME. I'll find something else to replace it as my fav app that doesn't try to wipe out apps I PAID for, completed or NOT.  Big BOO to this app! Thanks for the memories!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004DPBGCO 1 1330128000 650 To those concerned about downloading apps and becoming victims of data mining businesses, I've listed what this developer was asking for on Market vs. the "dog and pony show version" you're now downloading on Amazon (THAT WILL SURELY BE UPDATED sometime after FAOTD when the developer feels you've already trusted his app, are not paying close attention, and are "simply updating" for some other minor bug fix).Permisssions the developer submitted in his AMAZON FAOTD version:(the version you are considering downloading... for NOW)* Read only access to phone state.* Write to external storage.* Open network sockets.* Access information about Wi-Fi networks.* Access the vibration feature.* Access information about networks.The STANDARD permissions the developer currently asks for in his MARKET version:(NOTE: for both PAID & FREE Market versions identical, and only FREE version has "ads")* Network communication - full Internet access - Allows an application to create network sockets.* Phone calls - read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of thedevice. An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone, whether a call is active, the number that call is conncted to and the like.* Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage. Allows an application to write to the SD card.* Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator.* Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks.* view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi. (network comm.)Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a "car version" of the Block Me game, especially the Market's PAID version.  The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions, so in the paid version, you're paying for "more game" and not "less/no ads."  The developer clearly doesn't care about giving you more "game" for the money, because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon.  He knows asking for your phone's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call, and who called you, are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining.  So he takes it out.... but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful "leaderboard action" and "rate this app" and "notify me of bugs" stuff, as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they don't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app, what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD, what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to (even WITHOUT the phone serial number request), why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one (for now), and what he'll likely do to update YOUR app once he's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back, just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here, for instance the "paid" version of Bubble Popper.  The permission for the phone is IN there, even in that PAID version.P.S.  Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why, especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia. Why they can't get or don't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004KU2JZU 1 1321142400 51 This permission is entirely unnecessary and preventing me from downloading what is still, otherwise, an average app based on others' reviews.  Was going to at least try it, but phone call logs is a definite deal breaker.  They have no business knowing anything about who I call and who calls me.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006YFO31C 5 1334102400 98 Simply said, it plays well, great graphics, no ads or interruptions, and no invasive permissions.  THAT'S the way to get apps done!  I hope the developer follows suit and cleans up any other apps they have for sale like they did for this one.  If not, this will be a temporary one-hit wonder.  If they DO, and for the sheer number of games they have for sale, they will be a HUGE success in their genre of games here on Amazon (and likely over on Play as well).  This easily deserves 5 stars the way it is NOW!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006WFM7U8 2 1335139200 834 I don't really care what "developer" reasons this developer has for leaving the same exact two permissions in THIS app as is in the FREE ad-supported version on Google Play.  The Play version, however, has admob and adsense, but note that their FREE version (if you don't mind the ads) is a couple of months newer and contains another level.  This game is REAL SHORT -- 20 levels.  Once you DO get the hang of the bot, you'll go through this in NO time.  If you like it, I can't imagine this would last into a second day of gameplay with no levels left to play.The reason most people won't get through it in a half hour is because there are NO INSTRUCTIONS to this game, and they'll either be troopers and stick it out until they get it the LONG way, or just give up in frustration!  I actually had to go to Youtube to see if they had a video on how this thing works, and the developer had one, fortunately, that was somewhat of a help (couldn't see their finger movements, only the computer arrow).Once you DO get the hang of it (and I got it after about 10 minutes), it's going to be GAME OVER, though.  That's probably why it's free on Google.  But to charge $1.00 on Amazon for 20 levels that will be over in one day if you play it with gusto that day?  If it's worth it to you to spend a buck for a day's enjoyment, okay, but don't expect it to be hanging around on your device for a long period of time.It's almost as if they didn't want to charge the dollar, but decided to do that in order to get the FAOTD exposure they wouldn't have gotten as just another free, go-through-quickly, sub-par graphics game.  I suspect most folks will mute the music and sound after about 10 minutes of listening to the repetitiveness of it.As mentioned elsewhere, other than on Amazon:  Why is there no paid version in Google Play?  Developers have said before that they were unable to offer a paid version in Google Play because of restrictions in the store.  In terms of ratings, the game is downrated because it is rather short (20 levels), lack of instructions, and questions on what he's using the internet access for when the ads are gone.  (I can't accept the excuse about how innocent it is to collect anonymous data in the background from the users in order to gain specs which in turn might improve the app -- EVERY developer would LOVE that in EVERY app, but that's called SPYWARE when GOOGLE, et. al does it, and applies for developers TOO!)  In addition, just a glance at the screenshots shows the game has sub-par graphics.  I like the basic uncluttered look, but improvements can still be made without complicating it unnecessarily.I can't imagine, with all those little negatives like, graphics and instructions, taking a hit at this app, why on earth the developer would plunge the final dagger of death into his own PAID app by leaving in the permissions from the FREE app designed to filter in ads!  Was it REALLY THAT IMPORTANT to have the internet access STAY for some other subsidiary reason that most people regard as privacy invasion?  I'm sure it IS taking SOMETHING off your device to help the developer out in SOME way, however minor it may be.  (Or was he just not up to removing it, or short of time? What a shame if that's the reason!)But is it WORTH it to have that data as compared to the number of DOWNLOADS he would have gotten WITHOUT them?  Perhaps he knows the game needs more than 20 short levels, and that asking for money for the app wouldn't make him very much money at this point anyway, unless it included many more levels, and just wanted exposure as FAOTD.  He added ONE level to the Google version, on a recent update, as if that extra minute of gameplay was a huge improvement and what people/reviewers there meant when they said "add more levels."  It needs more than just one at a time added to justify PAYING for it -- or KEEPING it on their devices, for that matter.I think if the game's graphics were improved a bit (keeping them basic, variety of background colors/wallpaper and differnt bot-target colors/sizes, but not COMPLICATING them like some sort of pinball machine), provided a considerable number of additional levels, and took out the permissions that are no longer needed for ADS in a PAID version, it would actually be a winner!  I also think it needed to stay free ONLY, for awhile longer, while gaining exposure and pumping out the improvements that would one day justify charging for it.I'll keep it in the cloud to see what happens to it, and plan to revisit it (and perhaps re-review it) should anything significant arise in the world of Kokabot.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004LZIZHU 1 1322697600 1031 I like that in THIS version, "Sticky Fingers," the icons are LARGER than "regular" Candy Swipe (the paid game with different candy and sizes).  The games plays much better with these larger icons.  However, some things in this app are VERY annoying.  Some are repeats of problems that are in regular Candy Swipe, so I have repeated them here, and some are proprietary to this FREE app only.  They are as follows:1)  First... I was very excited to see it had an EXIT BUTTON.... however, IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE THE APP! WHY HAVE AN EXIT BUTTON to EXIT your program if it's still RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND and the user has to go to FORCE STOP IT via the APPS SETTINGS?? If you're going to put an EXIT BUTTON in, it shouldn't have the SAME FUNCTION AS THE BACKSPACE BUTTON, misleading people!  Make the EXIT BUTTON FORCE CLOSE THE APP, and if the user PREFERS TO HAVE IT STILL RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND because they prefer and trust the Android system to manage their OS more efficiently, they can simply use THE BACKSPACE BUTTON.... THEIR CHOICE!Is this misleading or just a programming oversight? I don't know and really don't care. But it's really illustrative of developers who put something out there without realizing what people EXPECT from function buttons they put in their apps. ALL other apps I have that include an exit button ACTUALLY FORCE CLOSE THE APP... that's why the developers go through the trouble of putting one there, to make the user happy!.... and I believe that's what the user USUALLY expects that button to do. But THIS APP does not do that.  It seems to have had a hurried push to get it out without checking simple things like "DOES MY EXIT BUTTON ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY EXIT THE APP?" And what are the USERS EXPECTING? And should I INFORM them that's it's the same as the backspace button?When people see an EXIT BUTTON, they expect it to EXIT...FULLY. AND THAT'S THE CONVENIENCE that's missing. Too bad. It's unlikely I'll play this app in the future when I need to kill 3 or 4 minutes (not wanting to play an app for whatever reason SHOULD be a 1-star if the developer wanted money for it) because I hate having to go through scores of clicks through menus to close it when it would have been just as simple to give the user THE CHOICE in the matter with a simple button that ACTUALLY EXITS the app.2)  Sometimes the game doesnt pick up my pattern string if I begin swiping a decent-sized string, and that's very annoying.  It happens much less frequently in THIS app than regular Candy Swipe, because this app has larger icons, but it is annoying nonetheless how easily you can lose a string for slightly touching another piece of candy that doesn't match.3)  Backing out of the app doesnt save the game if you don't use the exit button (or jumping to another app and back to this one, for that matter).  I don't really care about that too much because it DOES have an "exit" button that ONLY FUNCTIONS as the backspace button should (still runs in the background).  But I DO CARE about the lack of the ability to be able to PAUSE the game (of which you CAN do) to check a quick email or text and come right back to the game.  Currently, if I want to do that, I need to exit the app (and lose my score), go make the quick check, then RE-OPEN Candy Swipe and start over.  Ridiculous.4)  There is no "High Scores" button to click on the main screen as there is in the regular Candy Swipe game.  You can't even get in to remember how you did or if you beat an old score? This is pretty standard even in FREE games, so why they decided to obliterate that part of the screen with a "pay for the full version" button is beyond me.  I can see hiding the ability to play with friends (a more high-end feature)... but blocking your previous scores?5)  This app has the potential to be played by younger people, including small children on occasion.  So what's up with the constant playboy porn-type picture ads?  In a CANDY game?  Was it just not possible to get subsidized by Nescafe coffee and ITT Tech, like everybody else?  The ad for the candy company was a nice touch, though I don't live in Alabama.  I personally could care less, as I have no intention to giving it to kids, but don't you want the users of your app to WHIP this out, give it to their kids to play, and then have those kids annoy their parents to buy the full version?  Parents just WON'T do this with some of the ads you currently have.  That's not a preference for MY benefit.... it's just good advice for you to take or leave.6)  The picture (screenshot) shown here on Amazon (at least currently) is NOT what you get in this game.  Those candies are from REGULAR Candy Swipe, the paid game, and are shown smaller than what you get in THIS game.  This games has yellow cupcakes, swirly lollipops, green gumdrops, red gummy bears, CS blue circles (cookies?), pinkish cotton candy on a stick, and the points-multiplier icons of a lemon and a gumball machine.  The coloring is just a little dull/muted for this type of game, especially because it has a black background and makes the darker colors harder to see, but not as bad as the paid Candy Swipe (other version).7)  That "waaaat...waaaat...waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" sound at the end of each round has GOT to go.  That's the sound something should make when you LOSE or don't achieve something.  But that sound comes on no matter WHAT, even if I have over 20,000 points in one round and move to first place!  Surely something more dual-purpose and appropriate can be found to replace it with.I like the CONCEPT of the game, but it really needs some spit and polish before I can enjoy playing it again and recommend it as a ready-for-prime-time app.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B007HSP57Q 1 1331942400 800 UPDATE:  Forgot to add this the first time around.... this is puts 28 MB onto the external SD card, not 12 MB as the description claims.---------FYI to those are familiar with last month's Robin Hood app, this app today is by the same developer.  This was the app that had the "broacast stickie intents" problem (and the bad reviews to go along with it).  The developer apparently is not willing to part with that permission OR the network sockets.  I have no doubt in my mind whatsoever that the developer's other apps are promoted on this app or the others, and perhaps that's what the permission of internet is used for (or they WANT you to think it is used for).  But stickie intents are NOT used for that purpose.For the Robin Hood: Twisted Fairy Tales app FAOTD a month ago, the developer felt it necessary to come here and review their own app with the following (which the probably deleted, but I quoted it in one of my comments and it's saved in that way):  "I don't give many reviews, but I have to on this one. This is not just fun for young kids; I had a great time with my friends altogether to solve these. The art is great, the differences creative and the interface is the best for this type of puzzle! Great job, I'll be buying your other apps."  My response, of course, was that Amazon customers were not bozos, etc., etc.Incredibly, the developer now, I've noticed, tried another way to pad the reviews, by creating the alter-ego Amazon user ID "alpharhythms", and high-rated all the apps they ever created, most of them within the last several weeks, which is looking something like 69 apps altogether.  And amazingly, this "reviewer" reviewed them all one after another in succession, many on the same day, and every day thereafter until all the apps were positively reviewed.  Go look for yourself, and you'll see what I mean.  I guess they got clever and had to rethink how to bamboozle you after I called them out on the Robin Hood phony review under the user ID name "Hilandur" ("Highlander = Robin Hood" as we all know), and then he admitted to me that he was the developer.  Now he thought it more advantageous to pretend he was a married father of small children and took on that persona to post how much fun his "pretend family" was having with HIS apps.... and, mysteriously, ONLY his apps one after another in rapid succession.Additionally, this avalanche of apps just recently created by the developer were added recently and are only available on Amazon..... NONE of them are on the "other market."  I have no idea why a developer would create 69 games and none of them made available in the "other market."  You don't see THAT happen every day.But you need to note something about this avalanche of apps:  Every single one of these apps by this developer has BROADCAST STICKIE INTENTS and OPEN NETWORK SOCKETS.  And after the attack they received by the Amazon reviewers about the stickies, their response was to create DOZENS MORE apps with the SAME permissions and upload all of them in one big heap only up to the Amazon market.  There is no reason whasoever for any of these 69 apps to need stickies for the game function.The bottom line is this app has the STICKIE INTENTS and the OPEN NETWORK SOCKETS, and the combination of them is NOT SAFE.  They permit the sharing of some data between apps (HIS apps???) that you didn't specifically give permission for when you downloaded the ONE specific app you thought you were giving permissions for.  Most DEVELOPERS themselves don't use or like stickies because they, too, know of the risk they pose and actually want customers to download their apps!  This developer seems to very intent on keeping that intent present.With 69 apps thrown up on Amazon in one fell swoop and internet sockets in all of them, and ways to see the promtions of all the other apps inside all of them, I would be VERY conscientious of any updates in the future to ANY of this developers apps, because the sockets are already there in all of them to add whatever tools and data mining additions they wish, should that be why they cranked out dozens of FREE apps at one time.  Sure can't imagine why else the developer(s) working on these apps would go through all that work for so many apps and offer so many for free.  Surely they want to get paid for all that work SOMEHOW.... you can decide yourself how they intend to get paid or rewarded in the future for dozens of AD-FREE APPS that they charge ZERO for.Slan agat!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004JZBGWI 1 1321228800 44 WANTING TO UPDATE HERE, BUT WHY ARE PEOPLE SAYING IT DOES NOT INDICATE THAT IT SAVES YOUR NOTES??? WHO WOULD UPDATE AND WANT TO LOSE EVERYTHING??  HAVING THE CAPBILITY TO SAVE DATA IS SOMETHING YOU LEARN IN BASIC DEVELOPER 101 CLASS!  NEEDS FIX PRONTO!!!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004LUS390 1 1321574400 112 SketchBook Mobile EXPRESS (free) had same problem of FORCE CLOSING as soon as you tapped on the editor, little black square, with a sorry it unexpectedly closed notification. Now THIS dog does the same thing, only it also does so when pressing the colored swirl icon. Dont ask me what that icon is supposed to do, because it forced closed. You think they would have fixed this by now, its been months!!! My advice would be to download it while its free in hopes that they fix it in the future so you dont have to pay for this dog in the future, only to find out that they DIDNT fix it.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0064X7B4A 1 1328832000 152 First, it's really unfair to make add-ons for an app that tell you what letters are left in the bag, as well as a meter you can purchase to let you know in advance the strength of the word you propose to use.  This is Words with FRIENDS for heaven's sake!  It's not a a standalone app!  People who purchase these add-ons are not playing on a level playing field with the rest of their "friends" who are relying on their own smarts to achieve the best possible score -- not ELECTRONIC CHEAT APPLICATIONS.Second, where is the AD-FREE version?  Why not on Amazon but on on the Market??  Ah, on second thought, who cares.... we are no longer playing against "friends" and online acquaintances... we are playing against COMPUTERS, run by these friends, and then passing off their contributions to the WWF community as their own.  BIG BOO to the new add-ons!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004LZFWJO 1 1319846400 728 I used to like this app when I first downloaded it, but as time went on, some things became more apparent and very annoying.  They are as follows:1)  First... I was very excited to see it had an EXIT BUTTON.... however, IT DOESN'T FULLY CLOSE THE APP! WHY HAVE AN EXIT BUTTON to EXIT your program if it's still RUNNING IN THE BACKGROUND and the user has to go to FORCE STOP IT via the APPS SETTINGS??

AND THAT'S THE CONVENIENCE that's missing. Too bad. It's unlikely I'll play this app in the future when I need to kill 3 or 4 minutes (not wanting to play an app for whatever reason SHOULD be a 1-star if the developer wanted money for it) because I hate having to go through scores of clicks through menus to close it when it would have been just as simple to give the user THE CHOICE in the matter with a simple button that ACTUALLY EXITS the app.2)  Sometimes the game doesnt pick up my pattern string if I begin swyping a decent-sized string, and that's very annoying.  This is really because it's DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING when your finger is covering the screen.  If the icons were bigger, it wouldn't be a problem because your finger wouldn't cover the whole of the icon... but they are currently SO SMALL.3)  Backing out of the app doesnt save the game if you don't use the exit button (or jumping to another app and back to this one, for that matter).  I don't really care about that too much because it DOES have an "exit" button that ONLY FUNCTIONS as the backspace button should (still runs in the background).  But I DO CARE about the lack of the ability to be able check a quick email or text and come right back to the game.  Currently, if I want to do that, I need to exit the app (lose the points), go make the quick check, then RE-OPEN Candy Swipe and begin again.  Ridiculous.4)  The coloring is little dull/muted for this type of game, especially because it has a black background and makes the darker colors harder to see.  The cherries are a little too dark, and so are the gingerbread men and the candy corn.  They can all use a brighter color boost actually (and my screen is on "max" brightness, which is very bright).  This is a fast-paced visual app... colors needs to be TRUER, BRIGHTER, and colors VERY DISTINCTIVE from ONE ANOTHER if you want to be able to see the patterns easily, especially in daylight.5)  That "waaaat...waaaat...waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" sound at the end of each round has GOT to go.  That's the sound something should make when you lose or don't achieve something.  That sound comes on no matter whether you come in first place or tenth. Surely something more dual-purpose and appropriate can be found to replace it with.I like the CONCEPT of the game, but it really needs some spit and polish before I can enjoy playing it again and recommend it as a ready-for-prime-time app.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006XIR9KM 4 1334880000 490 Gameplay is good, responsive.  Futuristic-type font could use a little work to make it more readable.  Kudos for the backspace key that functions as an exit "button" that actually shuts the app down and doesn't keep it in the background.  Music/sound can be turned on/off.  Has a number of options to include an untimed mode (always a plus).Minus a star, though, for leaving the Admob and Adsense in the app, as well as the Google Play licensing.  Maybe it wasn't worth the trouble for the developer to take them out, since the only other versions of this game on both Amazon and Play are free and ad-supported, as well as needing the Google license added for Play.  The problem with dual licensing in one version is that when you now go to Play to see a list of apps you (supposedly) downloaded from THAT market, you will see this app in your list of "purchased" apps, and also see the app listed on your Amazon list of puchased apps.  However, you do NOT have a true "functioning" license on Play that could enable you to UPDATE it on Play, nor RATE the app on Play.  I find that irritating to have apps I didn't PURCHASE on Play to be LISTED on Play just because the developer added the Google licensing protection in the app that really had no business being there if the AMAZON license was correctly in the app as required.  It causes confusion when you go to Play, look at your long list of "purchased" apps, and not know which of those apps you could UPDATE there (or rate) until you click on each of them to see if the rating button is missing (which means you purchased it elsewhere, and good luck remembering where you purchased it).Admob and Adsense are the reasons for the free versions' net access, network state (to see if the user is connected to the net), and external storage access (possibly to write error logs to the SD, if not other unscrupulous reasons to consider).  But both of these are still inside the app, and can't function without the permissions the developer removed to create this PAID version.Still, it's nice to know the developer created a zero-permissions app, but for a price of a couple of dollars, which is perfectly fair.  If in the future, however, any internet, network, or storage permissions are added on an update (for other bells and whistles as the claim), I would say delete it (or don't update) because being PERMISSION FREE is the only reason folks would have paid $1.99 for this app in the first place.Just watch out for future updates, but download and enjoy this app today while it's free of permissions and cost!  It really IS a fun, more "adult" version of the classic match-it games usually designed for kids!  (And you won't get caught playing some cartoon zoo-animal-type matching game at the airport!)
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0058VW36U 3 1318204800 88 I didnt want to put too much effort into trying to figure out how those ropes were attaching after u cut them, and I just kind of gave up when the pattern got more complicated. I didnt want to sit there planning 10 moves ahead before I even touched the screen. Then it becomes more like chess but with lollipops.  Just a little on the boring side for me, but in all fairness, it DID work without force closing like so many other cruddy apps on the market.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004RJ6978 1 1321747200 840 SAD TO SAY I must update my otherwise favorable review of this app.  IT NEEDS AN EXIT BUTTON.  I find it HIGHLY ANNOYING and somewhat suspicious when an app doesnt provide that simple feature. Understand, I now find I wont even use the app because I WILL NOT be forced to take the time for all the extra steps it takes to go to my phones Settings, then to Apps / Manage Apps, scrolllllllll allllll the way down to find THIS app in the list, click on it, and then scroll to the Force Close button, click that, and exit out of that and then out of my Settings and close the folder I house them in. Really... should I have to go through THAT every time I want to access, lets say, my grocery list just to add one stinkin bunch of bananas?? All apps should have EXIT BUTTONS. Why?? If all apps felt they were the exception to this courtesy, theyd all "not be running/open," but theyd all collectively be using the internal memory of which they have no business using if I want to CLOSE THE APP BECAUSE I AM THROUGH WITH IT UNTIL THE NEXT TIME I WANT TO USE IT. I emailed the developer about this, first mentioning that there is no Exit button, and asked why I needed to Force Close it through Settings.  His prompt reply was to educate me on the android platform, making no mention of the Exit Button part of my email (so I assume theyre not working on adding one anytime soon), and basically blamed it on android by telling me "thats how android works" so that you can go back to an app using the Recent Apps menu button. He made NO mention that should I choose to go back to the app even after using an exit button, it would still be listed there and just reopen in one second.IMO, a standalone, non-syncing app such as a simple list maker NEEDS AN EXIT BUTTON.  Let ME decide whether I want to "back out of it" and keep that small amount of memory going or CLOSE IT COMPLETELY AND FULLY.  I shouldnt have to rely on a third-party app to control such nonsense from apps whose developers wont provide you with the common courtesy of a simple, lousy EXIT BUTTON.NOW.....A word about permissions here.  YES, the developer COULD have had the phone permission thing there because he wanted his app to pause while a phone call came through, but in the app world, that "one permission" he needed is just not available to developers (yet?).  It only comes as a "bundle pack."  Even when there's no apparent need for the Phone State and Identity permission on an app, many apps request it when you install it.  What that ALLOWS is for advertisers like Google to spy on you.  Phone State and Identity isn't "one permission" it's a whole BUNCH of permissions bundled together. It allows the app to see if you're on a phone call, read your phone number, your phone's IMEI number, the IMSI number of your sim card, and the device ID assiged to your phone (unique only to YOU).  Let's review....If you're on a phone call? Ok, we can live with that so that your phone can like tell the media player to pause the music until you hang up from the call.  Yeah, that's AN INNOCENT PERMISSION. The media player should keep quiet while I'm on the phone... but it doesn't need to know my PHONE NUMBER!  IMEI, the IMSI, and the unique ID seems innocent, but they're not. That unique ID is the brass ring to all spammers and advertisers.  These numbers can track you, and they're not like "cookies" on the web brower that you just opt out of. You can delete a cookie, but that device ID is permanently tied to your phone. The IMSI identifies your sim card and you can't change that, and changing the IMEI is just plain illegal in lots of countries. Now you throw those ingredients together with the permission to GO ONLINE (and that's ONLY going to come from "FULL INTERNET PERMISSION.", and that's a disaster recipe and the potential for abuse is just LIMITLESS. The phone permission thing is not SPLIT. That phone "state" permission shouldn't be in a bundle pack with permission to read your PHONE IDENTITY.  And that phone identity permission should be tuned, too, like permission to read your phone NUMBER should be separate from the other permissions.  Unfortunately, there's just no way to split it yet. They should allow granting phone state permission but deny access to phone IDENTITY.... or even better, feed BOGUS identity information to the nosy apps.NOW, OTHER permissions a phone has in conjunction with this one may be a "sinister bundle" with the intent to be nosy and grab your info for subsidiary purposes, but I'm not the developer and can't comment on what the developer's intentions are because of the android phone permissions bundle dilemma.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006MHWXMS 1 1325548800 228 Agreed, this app needs to follow the U.S. date format of mm-dd-yyyy if the developers actually want users in this country to USE it.  Some may not care, but many will.  The "January 32nd" is just pretty much a ridiculous oversight that shows sloppiness on the developer's part.  The inability to have sub-tasks nested is also going to drive away more users, the type that need a To-Do list for much more than simple lists with one heading.  Syncing constantly while the app is open is yet another downfall -- needs to have the ability to not sync until the user tells it to do so.  As far as only working with a Google gmail account, there are conflicting reports about that... but seriously LOL, this IS the ANDROID market, and if Google isn't your thing, maybe you should get an iPhone. Google is the nucleus of Android, and the full benefits of integration of Google products is one of the great benefits and draws of getting an Android phone in the first place.I won't start actually putting in my precious tasks and giving this app a shot at being my primary To-Do list unless these critical changes are made.  Therefore, it has to become yet another "download but don't install yet" app just hanging there in my Amazon apps list until/unless it becomes ready for prime time.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B00685VI98 1 1322179200 125 Are they KIDDING???  Are they sure they don't want my credit card pins and Social Security number, too??  There is absolutely no justification for asking to see thumbnails of what OTHER apps I'm currently in or HAVE JUST BEEN in and what I was DOING in them! And access to the wi-fi??  You want the key to my house, too?? This app needs to be renamed from Slice It to RAM IT!!!  Making a note here to stay away from THIS developer's apps now and in the future!  I'm sure the developer will make LOTS OF MONEY selling your personal information to heaven only knows WHO!  If you're stupid enough to allow this type of invasion of your privacy, you DESERVE whatever happens to you!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004MNUQAU 5 1318377600 74 THIS APP WITHOUT A DOUBT, AFTER 1 DAY OF PLAY AND 50 RACES, IS MY NEW FAVORITE ENTERTAINMENT APP!!  Finally, an app that has everything u want:  super graphics, grrrrrreat sounds, fantastic UI, NO ADS, AND NO GLITCHES, LAG, OR FORCE CLOSES AFTER HOURS OF PLAY!  You feel like youre right at the track!! And highly addictive and FUN! I LOVE IT!!!! WTG developers! Development at its finest (after so many FAOTD duds lately)!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B004R1LNGS 4 1318204800 92 Hope I never need it, but its very useful should you find your phone missing and dont know where you left it... at work?  In the car?  In the house? At a store? Just hope your battery was charged enough so that when u get to the internet, its still on to trace it. If someone shuts it off, or a thief immediately takes out the sim to sell it, its useless.  And its accuracy is only as good as your PHONES GPS capabilities, and in my case, it was dead-on perfect.
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B0051UP5NQ 1 1319932800 193 When I change my wallpaper, selections come up to use Gallery, Wallpaper, or Downloads.  Thats what everyone is used to.  Then clicking Gallery used to bring you STRAIGHT to you Gallery photos.  Well, not anymore!  Now clicking gallery requires an extra step to get there!  After clicking, it now says GALLERY (again!) and OfficeSuitePro!!  So now I have to again select Gallery bec this app has the capability of letting you view your gallery photos through it?? What if I downloaded SEVERAL apps that have that capability?  I then would have to SCROLL through a LIST of these apps to find my regular old GALLERY?  What nerve an app has of integrating itself into the basic wallpaper menu like that!  And the kicker is, I never even opened and set up the app itself, just downloaded and installed from Amazon!  When I select my GALLERY, I expect to go to my GALLERY, not be asked HOW I want to get there!  At the very least, give the option to have it NOT do that.... or just put their OSPro icon in the WALLPAPER MENU, so I could select either IT *OR* the Gallery!!
A12YPVJ4WG8N2C B006M5A75K 2 1326499200 549 Playing a round in the timed mode is annoying.  You are basically cut off from doing your best, even if you can recognize and swipe words without taking time to think.  This is because as the timer goes down, the speed at which the balls replenish becomes so fast that it's virtually impossible to make any more words and get more points.  I can understand the speed being increased, but not to a point where it's so fast that 1) it's basically telling you that the game is over no matter how fast you can swipe, and 2) when it's going that fast, it doesn't recognize any words you DO manage to get in at the last second if it's filling up the bottom row.  This happens every single time that the time is about to run out and the last 5 or 6 balls are flying in -- any word you swipe anywhere on the board doesn't register at all.  Like I said, I don't mind it going faster toward the end, but not so fast where you can't make words or get points for anything before the clock has stopped.  The timed game needs to be a little longer, that's all.Playing a round in the relaxed mode gives you the ability to control the speed at which the balls appear on the screen, and is a much better gameplay.  At a medium speed, you can go 5 hours without it stopping, and gain a tremendous number of points, if you have the ability.  However, the complaint is that I feel it's going a little faster on the bottom half of the screen.  The problem with this is that the game then forces you to make little words on the first couple of rows and makes you not want to wait for 4 or 5 rows to fill up to be able to create bigger words and gain more points.  It's as if the gameplay then becomes less of a "make a big word, gain more points" game and more of a "make any word as fast as you can, as small as you can, and just get rid of the damn letters as fast as you can" game.  It's really a hassle to play once the screen becomes just half full.  By the time you quickly scan the board to visualize your word, another row has just filled up, and you're not concentrating on the words but just on the fact that you have to clear that screen.That's why this game would be more enjoyable for those looking for the excitement of clearing a board as fast as possible, arcade style, and not for those who like "word games" because of the intellectual challenge.  If this app wants to combine both, they need to ease up on the rate at which the balls are replenished because the scale is tipped in the direction of speed and not in the direction of "content," which is more important to fans of word games.  If not, this game may as well just get rid of the letters altogether and go with colored ball strings and become another bejeweled clone, because that's what's it's like now without the improvements to the "create the best word you can" aspect of the game.
A12YQBP4HWYPY4 B008Y0REKC 5 1349827200 31 this is a good game but I don't like the tutorial. it just hose on on I wish they did not have it but other than that it was really good

A12YQBP4HWYPY4 B00K7WGUKA 5 1402531200 47 This is a really good app it is just like the real thing the only thing that is different is the name. I think it is a cool app because you can change the color of the black tiles to something like pin  or blue or green
A12YQBP4HWYPY4 B00AHNC0SK 5 1372896000 35 this is a great app so when i want something to do and the best part ITS FREE so hit that button and download it right now go do it. ;) :) have fun playing

A12YUI5U5EKKT1 B00DEG4Z1W 1 1372377600 26 I downloaded it and I wanted to play it so I clicked on the app and I wouldn't load all I saw was a black screen
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B008FRFN7A 5 1351123200 31 Could not believe it. All I did was load app and select print and it printed right away. No set up or need to select printer it found it right away.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B007C8DXQQ 5 1335139200 25 It is good gives some use of mind skills. Really acts like wheel of Fortune. Enjoy the challange. Will keep it on my Kindle Fire.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B00FEIX5OG 5 1398816000 20 It was more fun then I thought it would be. I really. enjoy challange of getting Max stars each game.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B004I744AS 5 1358294400 23 I try to use correct words and find definations very useful. I also enjoy historical information. I have found it useful and entertaining.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B008AZGWYK 5 1388880000 20 Did not know the value I would find in this app.I take medication and need to know interactions with them.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B007ZGO7EM 5 1372982400 33 I was really glad to find this app. It is great. Large easy to read and simple to use. I do bookkeeping and has history so I can check back on previous calculations.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B0072KBY2Y 5 1335139200 21 Do not use this often but really good when on a trip or just going out of town. Gives good information.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B004JJUY4K 5 1377475200 22 I have used Kayak for years and is nice to have on my Kindle.I will use it often.  Thanks for offering it.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B008Y2FRFO 5 1351900800 20 Fun,  fun, fun . Time waster but really enjoy it. Take the time to try it,  you won't be sorry.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B004GYVYV0 4 1335139200 29 I am happy I downloaded this app. I like being able to have reminders off due dastes for bills as my busy lifestyle has caused me to miss payments.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B005EIRU6U 3 1335139200 25 I felt this did not have enough involvement by player. I would rather do more than just turn over cards. Found a more interactive App.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B00A04F8NU 5 1352937600 22 It is fun and challenging. I found most objects but really had to search for some. Would recommend it for all ages.
A12YV2K2A2Y1FY B004H6WTJI 5 1338249600 26 I find this program on Kindle Fire makes easy to keep track of caloric intake. It makes you aware of eating habits. Really have been helped.
A12YV5AWK7TKSS B00D6SBOWG 5 1395705600 23 I love this game.  The graphics are great and it is just a fun way to pass the time. Great for any age.
A12YV5AWK7TKSS B007XMV9XK 4 1360800000 21 I like this game because it has several types of exercises.  I like to play this game anytime of the day.
A12YV5AWK7TKSS B00G9EZ448 5 1395014400 27 I love this game. It is a great way to pass the time and fun for all ages. I highly recommend it to everyone, young and old.
A12YV5AWK7TKSS B00APKROYK 3 1360800000 26 I play this game on occassion.  It is worth keeping on my Tablet to give me some variety.  Give it a try, you might like it.
A12YV5AWK7TKSS B00964BWFS 4 1361836800 26 The great part of this game is that you build your own fish tank.  Nice varety of fish, plants and other stuff to decorate your tank.
A12YWEKC5KS5GE B0054QY36C 3 1340668800 30 this is a widget, not an app.  ie, it doesnt seem to work unless you put the widget on your homescreen.  too bad, i was looking forward to using this.
A12YWEKC5KS5GE B00IEBE7GK 5 1393632000 35 Great brain teasers.  Easily one of the best games I've played on my kindle.  The hints are silly sometimes though...oh, thank you for telling me that the key I just picked up might be useful....
A12YWEKC5KS5GE B00IKZX1ZI 4 1395964800 57 Yes, it's a Candy Crush clone, but it does have some significant differences and new concepts.  For everyone complaining about it not being free, it is free.  It's just that some of the levels are indeed challenging so you just keep at it, eventually you'll win.  As Penny Arcade said, &amp;#34;I'll hate play this game for free&amp;#34;
A12YWEKC5KS5GE B004HXHVZ8 5 1396137600 32 Without a Vudu app, this is the only way that I know of to watch your Ultraviolet collection on your Kindle.  The download for offline viewing was a surprise, and much welcomed.
A12YWEKC5KS5GE B004YL6RUI 5 1316822400 29 i dont generally review free appofthe day, but this one is really nice.  it is basically a homescreen folder replacement that looks a lot better and with more options.
A12YWEKC5KS5GE B00HF19RVK 3 1394841600 28 Started great. Story and graphics are good.  But then it asked for an update that would never complete.  I wanted to like this, but can't even play it.
A12YXCG0DZ5IFN B00EEDJHXA 5 1387584000 28 Didn't think I would like it, but it was app of day so I figured, why not. I found I enjoy it to pass time. Perfect for that.
A12YXCG0DZ5IFN B00640UICA 4 1377216000 37 I just downloaded as free app of day. Not sure yet. Don't feel I love it b it I keep playing. Still too early in game for me to know for sure. Think it has possibilities. Lol
A12YXCG0DZ5IFN B00CDV6WDS 5 1373587200 56 I had given up on playing cuz as my age went on my eyes got , worse as we all know. Sometimes I had trouble telling which level the tiles were on. Well &quot; NO PROBLEM ON THIS GAME&quot;  I could play it with no problem. Glad to be able to play this game again !!!!
A12YXCG0DZ5IFN B00FAPF5U0 4 1382140800 40 About time they put it on kindle!!!!!!  Been waiting. My 4 stars rating is nexus some levels are frustrating and almost impossible with out spending real money. And when u get frustrated u don't enjoy playing. I am level 163
A12YXCG0DZ5IFN B009KS4XRO 3 1361577600 40 This did have 5 stars but since they haven't updated with the last 2  rooms there is no reason for me to play on here. My phone DOES have the update so now I have to play on my phone
A12YXCG0DZ5IFN B00A4O6NMG 4 1399248000 133 Lol  Still not sure how I feel about the game, but I keep playing it......not assure why at this point but I just do.  Can't say I like it yet but I don't...not like it.Well I played a while and I just don't have the patience for it. Breeding after the first few is hard to get different monsters and I can't wait only to find it is the same old ones I already have. I bought diamonds to speed up but went thru them fast and still ended up with the same ones. For me it just got a little repetitious. Also I didn't have friends playing which supposedly would have helped with breeding by lighting the torch. I don't have patience to wait and wait to move thru levels and stuff.
A12Z4PG1H05KN B00A0YXZVW 5 1355270400 22 This game is a fun way to pass the time. The horses are really cute and the direction are easy to follow.
A12Z4PG1H05KN B00BW08XRO 3 1371859200 24 This game is pretty ok. It gets challenging as the day goes on but the levels aren't too hard. I do enjoy this game.
A12Z4PG1H05KN B007SPMWOM 4 1344211200 22 Sushi chop is very addicting. It's. also a great. time killer.  I highly recommend this app to others and it's even free.
A12Z5X1XOCT9LI B0063GSL60 5 1387584000 24 Fun game and easy to use, plus it was free!  I even downloaded this game to my mom's kindle so she could play too!
A12Z5X1XOCT9LI B00BUR9KJE 4 1376611200 27 I like playing yahtzee so was happy to find this game.  It's simple and easy to play....just my speed!  And my grandaughter likes to play it too.
A12Z5X1XOCT9LI B004DLPXAO 2 1387584000 30 I tried to download kindle on my Galaxy S4 and it just keeps telling me I need to download the application.  I haven't been able to get it to work.
A12Z5X1XOCT9LI B0066T8SDU 5 1376611200 27 I love playing scrabble, so this is a good game.  Just wish it had a dictionary and I could challenge the computer.....I think it cheats sometimes! LOL!
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B008ZOHCKE 5 1371081600 105 I really like the virtual bookshelf.  I have mine set to sort alphabetically, and I find it easy to create a new book whenever the need arises.  It is possible to have a different notebook for every subject and the nice thing is it keeps everything in one place where you can find it.  You can even flip through the pages as if reading an actual notebook.  It is one of my favorite note taking apps.  I'd recommend it for anyone that likes to take their info. with them, just type it in &amp; the app will save it for you to read again later.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B004SZHD3K 5 1371081600 130 This is one of my favorite slot apps, I've played it extensively &amp; I absolutely love it and spend a lot of time playing it.  I've already bought 7 of everything from the slots store &amp; still have over $800 million, so I've obviously been playing for quite a while.  I would strongly reccommend this for slot enthusiasts because it's one of the best casino-style games ever.  You can play 3 machines &amp; the longer you play, the higher the super-jackpot.  The best thing ever about this app is that the game does not use real money, you won't find that in a real world casino &amp; the machines Pay out more often than the real ones do.  It is by far the most played game on my Kindle Fire.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B004HXHVZ8 5 1371081600 53 I love this app, I do not have to travel all the way to the theater to find out what time a movie is playing.  It is extremely simple to operate &amp; shows viewings from multiple cineplexes.  By far one of the best apps ever &amp; definitely a very useful app to have.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B008LG021M 5 1371081600 81 It's Fast&amp;Furious meets DeathRace.  A race between you and 7 other cars with various weapons.  Outrun slow cars &amp; blast away the faster ones, upgrade engines and weapons.  Get faster, better cars &amp; if you beat the boss, you take the car(single player mode).  In multi-player, win more points &amp; cash for upgrades like the next car. There are different race tracks. There are all kinds of vehicles.  Choose your car, arm it, upgrade all &amp; then the race is on.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B0063IH60K 3 1371081600 50 I have played this game before, but it is nice how you can change the playing background on the card table.  Also you can change between Vegas &amp; standard scoring.  I don't play it as much as some other games, but it is an ok way to pass the time.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B004SCEUXE 3 1371081600 30 This is a good app to have if you are a Star Wars fan.  It doesn't really do that much, but how cool is it to have a light saver?
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B008Y2FRFO 5 1371081600 27 This is one of the most fun coin push machines I have ever played.  I've played over 200 levels &amp; I really enjoy winning prizes &amp; coins.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B00DJFIMW6 5 1372982400 44 I love this game. The 1st day I got it, I played it for hours. It's great for kids too, but adults can have fun playing too.If you love the movie, you'll love this game. I would recommend it because it's such great fun.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B0064DBE9I 4 1371081600 38 I really like how it shows you how to play songs with different instruments. It has classics such as the birthday song &amp; twinkle little star &amp; others.  It is a good app for anyone who loves music.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B005HSL626 5 1371081600 83 I love this game, I could play it all day long.  It is easy to play &amp; lots of fun.  It's appropriate for all ages, so adults &amp; kids can enjoy this game.  I'm an adult and I spend lots of my free time playing this game.  I like that it can be played without the wi-fi(wireless) feature because I can enjoy the game in the car, at the mall, or where ever I am I can really enjoy playing this awesome game.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B006C1DH92 5 1371081600 54 If you are a fan of FRUIT NINJA, then I would strongly recommend this game.  If you love Puss In Boots &amp; Fruit Ninja, you will enjoy this game.  I already had Fruit Ninja on my Kindle Fire, but when I saw the Puss in Boots version, I knew I'd love this game too.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B007URBVA4 4 1371081600 69 I got the 1st Let's Bowl game, but I like this one better.It took me a while to unlock all bowling balls &amp; alleys, because I played the game without purchasing bowling bucks.  I love that there are more alleys to bowl in this game &amp; more balls to choose from with different power-ups.  It's one of the best bowling games that I would recommend for Kindle Fire users.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B00CEBKMN8 5 1371081600 50 This game is lots of fun, I also have Coin Dozer on my Kindle Fire, but I really enjoy this game.  I like the bonus spin wheel that gives you extra coins to use in the game.  This is one of the best coin games that I have ever played.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B0057B1C90 4 1371081600 42 This is one of the best bowling games that I have ever played.  The only thing I wished for is more bowling balls &amp; alleys, but I found that in Let's Bowl2.  It's still fun to play &amp; is a good game.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B00CWY76CC 5 1372982400 34 I like how you get to actually explore the rooms in order to search for clues &amp; hidden objects.  It is both fun &amp; challenging.  It's a really good game for exercising your mind.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B0057PAY8G 4 1371081600 107 This is a good app to have if you find articles online that you would like to read later.  You have to be careful though, once deleted, content is gone.  Also if you send anything to Archive, it will require wi-fi to retrieve it.  I figured out that I could not watch youtube videos unless I was connected to the Internet.  One thing that I like &amp; find really useful is that if you find an interesting article on Wikipedia &amp; don't have time to read it then, it can be saved &amp; read later offline.  This is good if you are somewhere without an Internet connection.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B00D5YT6IA 5 1372982400 64 I love this game. It has enough puzzles to keep me thinking all day long.  It is challenging, but not too hard &amp; it will give you hints if you get stuck.  Here's a tip: each time you go to the menu &amp; then back to puzzle, letters will be re-arranged.  Write down repeating letters &amp; use anagram solver if you really get stuck.
A12Z8RH64RTLZK B004SUWR2C 3 1371081600 46 Now that  the game is available on kindle, you no longer have to carry around a deck of cards.  There are different levels of difficulty to provide a challenge.  I've enjoyed playing a few games, but it is still a good card game for Uno fans.
A12ZCUNO1J9FAR B009KS4XRO 5 1372204800 23 This is the best game.  I play it daily. I have made many new bingo friends and it is just so much fun
A12ZCUNO1J9FAR B0054JZC6E 4 1356566400 23 has all type of games for everyone. some are very easy,  and some a little harder but all fun. great for all ages
A12ZCUNO1J9FAR B00ADPH2YO 4 1362960000 25 this slot game is not bad would like to see more ways to get more coins without filling out ads so they get your email
A12ZCUNO1J9FAR B008JJS6D2 3 1363564800 39 game is ok, you don't play against other people. I have a Kindle Fire and it does not call out the letters not sure if it is suppose to or not. it would be really nice if it did
A12ZCUNO1J9FAR B00AVGGYNA 5 1363910400 25 this is a fun Hinton game and the prizes are good. I would tell my friends to get this versing of the game of bingo
A12ZKH7Y1O6F3V B0086700CM 5 1358035200 20 This  game  is on  the  edge  kind of  game , keep  you on  your  feet at  all times very good
A12ZKH7Y1O6F3V B00IVG0YXI 5 1395360000 26 I spend a lot of time playing this game ,a whole lot of fun! I really like this game , please send more like it !
A12ZKH7Y1O6F3V B00AEJM6H2 5 1358035200 20 A very  fun  game  to  play  when  u  have  nothing  to do ! such  a great game on  my kindel
A12ZNE8P69HFZJ B00BW08XRO 4 1371340800 39 I beat this game in about 2 hours so you would have to pay for the whole game to see if it is something that you would really like.  I did like playing it while I had new levels.
A12ZNE8P69HFZJ B009HKL4B8 5 1369180800 61 I downloaded this game for me but my 5 year old daughter has taken it over during her Kindle time that she earns with good behavior.  It is very easy to use and is just like Sims that you pay for in the stores.  I love that it is free but she is soon going to what to buy a version!
A12ZNE8P69HFZJ B00CAK052Q 5 1371340800 36 My son loves this game!!  He was so excited to show his daddy.  The game isn't frustrating with him and is fun to play with two people trying to keep the truck going.  No trouble downloading.
A12ZNE8P69HFZJ B00C5A5B02 5 1370044800 20 My 3 year old loves playing this game!  There were no issues downloading the game and it works correctly everytime.
A12ZNE8P69HFZJ B00D2K40WY 5 1371340800 26 My 5 year old picked this game and LOVES it.  She plays it every time she gets &#34;Kindle Time.&#34; Great game!!  No trouble downloading this game.
A12ZOPQPDZ7JR7 B009JNXK88 5 1376265600 22 Fun game, good music, good controls, and lack of permissions make this a win, and good for 5 stars in my book.
A12ZP8C58N8AFE B00ANT8OF6 4 1356998400 25 my son loves this app. he is 3 and can' t do everything, but will spend a long time on the parts he can do.
A12ZP8C58N8AFE B0064TVQ5E 2 1356480000 52 This version of Mahjong was too difficult for me because the designs were so similar.  On our Kindle Fire HD it was hard to tell the difference between each tile.  It kind of defeats the purpose of playing if you can't even tell what you're doing.  There are better options out there.
A12ZP8C58N8AFE B009S984J8 4 1356998400 42 our 3 year old enjoys this app. there is not much to it. click on the items an  it lists it and then does something  with them. example: click on stethoscope and you hear Daniel' s heartbeat. can get boring very quickly.
A12ZPYBE2U3NQP B007VUA7VO 5 1351987200 26 Works well. Even talks to u by telling u how much u have left and how much it had charged.  It is free and no problems.
A12ZPYBE2U3NQP B007Q3KX42 3 1348099200 50 crashes like crazy uggghhhh!!!!  just fix it already!!!!!!!  and stop charging so much for stuff with cash.  u make it free game and then charge outrageous cash for the big timers!!!!  maybe if it wasn't so much u might make ur money.  fix the crashing and then u make money!!!!!!
A12ZPYBE2U3NQP B0070Z89CY 3 1340236800 20 wish u could bet more than one hand on blackjack and wish u get more tickets each spin like 5
A12ZPYBE2U3NQP B0054JZC6E 5 1325980800 36 fun enjoy playing. will have fun should try it out. games I never played before. addicting. get points to unlock other games so makes u Wang to keep playing. all games are different and are strategy.
A12ZR3I2W7O2H9 B008IXP8IU 5 1369699200 22 This game is fun because it has a lot of puzzles and it keeps my whole family guessing at all the games.
A12ZR3I2W7O2H9 B0069G5Z9K 5 1365724800 32 I love love love this game!! My brother had it on his ipad so i downloaded it onto my Kindle Fire and it works great with very little advertising.  And its fun!
A12ZR3I2W7O2H9 B008K8VDPU 4 1365811200 26 This app is awesome!  I can fool around on the piano when I'm on vacation or something.  Fun! I love all the different  settings it has.
A12ZR3I2W7O2H9 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392595200 28 I like this game especially since you can't get flappy bird on kindle fire.  I think its cool and by rating this I unlock all the birds colors
A12ZR3I2W7O2H9 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1380326400 29 I love this app because it's fun, easy, and free!! Im a big fan of the Simpsons, so this was a must have for me, and Im not dissapointed.
A12ZRZGJDXCNA1 B00GGOVTN6 3 1399248000 72 I did like the game for the first 20 minutes or so. Until I found out that I have to earn my &#34;money&#34; (for clothes and such) from winning little fashion contests. And since I'm not that into fashion, I lost 3 &#34;contests&#34; and didn't have anymore money to spend on anymore clothes, and no way to start over. I still find it rediculous how a little dress can cost over $300.
A12ZRZGJDXCNA1 B00FAX6XQC 3 1399939200 36 This is fun and challenging. But got frustrating when I had to keep buying different guns and tools. And sometimes you can't continue the game unless you have the certain gun/tool, which is not available yet.
A12ZRZGJDXCNA1 B00IKZX1ZI 4 1399248000 22 the first 20 or so levels were pretty easy for me. But after that it got really hard. It definately challenges you.
A12ZRZGJDXCNA1 B00H3FNAOI 2 1399248000 21 It would be nice for someone who enjoys art and uses a calculator a few times a week. But I don't.
A12ZRZGJDXCNA1 B00FIW5BZE 5 1399248000 36 I took me a few minutes to figure it out. But I love it. I just wish that they could change it up a bit. Maybe add a part where you can compete with other people.
A12ZSD6MLU3187 B004SJ3BCI 4 1357948800 31 Ok, we all know angry birds. This game is now a classic. Good times, hours of fun. Not the most thought provoking, but still a great app, especially for touch screens.
A12ZT220LJJA26 B008Y2FRFO 4 1382054400 20 love that you gain coins even while you aren't playing.love the shake meter and how the prizes drop down. fun
A12ZT220LJJA26 B00CLVQ8GG 3 1371686400 20 Don't like it.  Can't get enough daily bonus to do anything..waste of time. other bingo games are much better sorry
A12ZT220LJJA26 B00BXL45G0 4 1374364800 22 this is so different from the regular bingo games you can get..love it but would like it if you could play longer
A12ZT220LJJA26 B0093BM38O 5 1374364800 20 love this app as it is so fun..love that you can pick the level you want to play. great game
A12ZTER6QVZTLS B009KS4XRO 5 1393459200 21 Love the game butt getting overwhelmed with all the games out there. I will keep playing this one I do enjoy.
A12ZTER6QVZTLS B00HIFVID8 5 1389398400 20 Great game to play would recommend to anyone. Play about once a week and others I know are playing also.
A12ZTER6QVZTLS B00GT67UUM 5 1393459200 20 very challageing and exciting. Makes your mind work. I would recommend to anyone. I would purchase more of these games.
A12ZTER6QVZTLS B00CELIPL4 3 1393459200 21 don't play more for younger people. Not interesting for me and would only recommend for the younger kids in the family.
A12ZU2DB2V7C6L B00HHBXYGM 5 1393632000 26 one of the best match 3 game I have ever played.very entertaining. I definetly suggest this game to all.great graphic and sound.a great game for all.
A12ZU2DB2V7C6L B00F0U8SAO 5 1384128000 27 very intriguing game, cannot wait for the sequel.kind of hard at time but make your brain working.I have play this game for few days and cannot stop.
A12ZW377E5STDZ B00A13BI7U 3 1352937600 20 while cute it really has to be ur thing. im only even playing cause of the quest in dragon story
A12ZW377E5STDZ B009OYOASG 4 1351468800 22 while i originally only started playing because of the quest in dragon story i started liking the game for its cute qualities.
A12ZW377E5STDZ B00A37XD90 5 1379289600 31 I really like this game it's fun to play every now and then or for long periods of time when he bored. The games I usually play are pokemon and zelda.
A12ZW377E5STDZ B008K8VDPU 4 1369267200 36 it's pretty self explanatory, but it is a bit difficult  with only having a few keys at your disposal, but i like that you can pick different songs. (i especially like the fullmetal alchemist theme song)
A12ZW377E5STDZ B009OYODAG 5 1351209600 29 while i really only started playing because of dragon storys quests i started to really like the game and may even continue  playing it after i finish the quests.
A12ZW377E5STDZ B00CKOYVG8 3 1369267200 25 just another angry bird game but you can play with your friends...why would you have friends that all want to sit and play angry birds.
A12ZXJPQNRP7PT B004GJDQT8 5 1346889600 86 What else is there to say - it's an Amazon App store app that allows you to browse or search the Amazon App Store direct from your Android device. I've had no problems using the app on my tablet. The only improvement I could suggest is a delete feature, for those daily free apps I tried but no longer want to keep. After deleting them from my tablet, the app notifies me they're available to upgrade/reinstall and won't let me purge the list of unwanted apps.
A12ZXJPQNRP7PT B005MSJ3DK 3 1353110400 108 I downloadedFind the Differences: Piratesto my tablet as a game my grandchildren could play that would help sharpen their observational skills. It is a decent game for the stated ages (children 5-9). Like others, we found there were some differences that were hard to touch-select, a few were obscured by the red circle around a previous correct choice, and there were fewer pictures than I would have thought should be included in a for-pay game. (I downloaded it when it was offered as the Amazon free app of the day.) We have only used the untimed levels, so we have no comments to provide about the timed levels.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366675200 49 I havent passed a level yet, but am rating this app because I want the free hints given for rating it. But honestly, so far it seems like a game that will have me addicted in no time. Already I have been searching tge web for answers. Four stars.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00A8ECU24 3 1360195200 283 (ORIGINAL REVIEW) Its hard to admit this, but I really enjoy this game despite being an adult. I'm getting pretty high up in levels now and I can tell that soon Ill have to actually spent money if I want the last few ponies. My only problem is that I have no idea how to add neighbors. Since I play the game on both my kindles, my only neighbor is myself. I go to gl live but still don't know how to add friends. so if someone else knows, please add both bethb6228, and beth6228. Also, my one account shows up with a profile picture that is not me. I don't know who it is or why its there...perhaps someone else originally had that username? anyway...its a fun game.(UPDATED REVIEW)This game was so addicting at first, then I got to level 60,and the fun stopped. Up until the update, which took months, you could not advance any higher. There was also nothing left to buy for Ponyville unless you purchaced gems. Then came the update, and with it I advanced several levels instantly. But I did not like the update at all. Another town was added, one you have travel to by train,and this town has completely different buildings and houses that you can buy, but only for that town. Besides that, the new town is horribly ugly...its colors are painful to look at...so drab and poorly done. They should have just expanded the original town and added more goals. The new addition is horrible. I have not played since. Even my three year old has lost interest since the update. If the colors cant attract a child, someone has done something wrong.
A13009KI5LAKNI B008ZOHCKE 5 1364342400 78 It may seem strange that I'm so excited about this app, but really, its perfect for anyone who likes to write down their ideas, dreams, grocery list, etc. I was getting so annoyed having to use one &quot;notebook&quot; for all my many writings. I love to be able to categorize my work, separating my journal from book chapters, and my dream pages from my grocery list. This app is awesome! I cant wait to use it every day!!
A13009KI5LAKNI B00GH4YC34 4 1394496000 91 I downloaded this app because I was desperate to find anything that might help my insomnia. While I've never really paid much attention to what's being said, I do find the voice to be very relaxing and soothing. It definitely slows my brain down, which, as most women know, is hard to do. I'm sure this app has much more to offer, but I recommend it to anyone who just needs a minute away from their thoughts. It hasn't cured my insomnia, but it's definitely useful for helping you to relax.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00AZZGOWI 5 1364688000 205 I have to disagree with the one star reviews. I don't find this game to be nearly as slow in its progression as other, similar games. No matter how many times a day I open the game, there's always something to do. However, I have never purchased any gold coins for this game so I cannot honestly say whether or not you'll receive them. I have also never tried to contact customer service, so my review is based strictly on the game play itself, nothing more. Yes, there are items that can be purchased using gold coins (which are not easily or quickly accumulated), but they are not necessary for game advancement. The only complaint I have so far, is the social aspect. I do believe that you have to make some sort of purchase in order to get your park into the park ratings. It also takes a bit of time figuring out how to add parks to your list, which will ultimately help you to earn more gold coins.It would also be nice if there were a confirmation button when it comes to deleting things, simply because its too easy to accidentally delete rides. Other than that, this is a great free game.
A13009KI5LAKNI B009UWME8U 5 1364601600 122 I really enjoy playing this game and trying to beat my own high score. I'm really glad that I found this app, because I was really getting tired of all the picture-word games that last about an hour before you beat them. This one is, by far, much more entertaining and seems to go on indefinitely.This game isn't just a fun time-waster, it's also great exercise for your brain. After a while, I noticed that I was getting really good at being able to logically deduce the answer after just one guess. It's also helped greatly when playing other word games such as text twist, word mix, ruzzle, wheel of fortune or scrabble.I'm glad I found this game. Five stars for sure.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00H83GGVO 1 1394496000 84 I don't understand all the good reviews, but maybe it's just me. I didn't understand what to do, despite the obvious glow in the area of interest. No matter what I clicked or what I tried to do, it got me nowhere. I just didn't get the point, couldn't grasp what I was supposed to do, and the one puzzle I did just didn't make sense. Like I said, maybe it's just me. I'm more into point and click adventure games, not puzzle games.
A13009KI5LAKNI B006OCM13M 1 1343606400 274 Ive never come across a company, prior to TL, that will go to such extremes to get your money. while this game is &quot;free&quot; there is a lot of in app purchasing, and TL has strategically placed these &quot;purchase now&quot; buttons in places that are easily tapped by accident.It didn't take long to realise that I wasn't being credited for money I was earning in the game. on top of that, when you accumulate a large amount of gems (which are needed to buy all the good decorations) you'll start to notice them dissapearing. Any problems you have with the game-and I assure you, there are a lot- you have to take it up with TL 's customer service. Customer service is as helpful to us players as gasoline is to a fire. in the past week alone, TL has managed to completely switch around everyones account (so don't assume you'll be the only one with access to your bakery or farm), create a lock -out which cost everyone millions of game dollars, and create a non -optional player that has somehow caused daily &quot;force closes&quot; . these problems are not isolated...my kindle freezes everytime I open a TL game. NEEDLESS TO SAY, after six months of putting up with TL 's intrusive and unethical decisions, I am uninstalling both bakery story and farm story. its really a shame because these games were once a lot of fun. now whenever I play I cant help but wonder what feature TL has newly added to trick us out of money.The game could be awsome, but the developers are unethical and greedy. Don't waste your time.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00CLVQ8GG 4 1369958400 140 So far I've downloaded nine different bingo games. While some of them were horrible, and I do mean absolutely not worth your time, this one I could play all day. But that brings me to the downside of this version. I know that the idea, like several other versions, is to collect objects that will allow you to receive a bigger dollar bonus each day. But when you start out,  its too easy to run out of cash quickly, making it so that you either cannot play till the next day, or you have to buy additional dollars with real cash.On the upside, there is a higher amount of bingos allowed so that you actually have a chance of getting one, as apposed to getting only two daubs before the game is over. All in all, a well designed version.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00AEWUQG2 2 1362960000 77 I thought i would love this game, and probably would if you could actually advance without logging in through facebook. As it is, i can only level up as far as my daily credits will allow, but then the next day, I'm back to level one. Its really dissapointing that so many games require you to login through facebook in order to advance. After a week, I stopped even bothering with the game. There's just no point.
A13009KI5LAKNI B0055SWM08 5 1330300800 96 this game is by far the best logical puzzle game that I've ever bought. if I had payed triple it still would have been money well spent. the graphics are great and unlike many apps I currently have, quell does not cause my kindle fire to freeze. this game is very addicting and does not cause me to pull my hair out in frustration like games such as unblocked it. when you mess up its easy to start over and try a different route. many boards and many hours of fun. I highly recommend this app.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00HFUNYWY 1 1391644800 127 I thought this game would be like Star Girl, and it was...but it appeared to be either a knock-off, or a very poor version. The ideas are the same as in Star Girl, but they aren't carried off as well. The graphics are cheaper, the layout more confusing, and the game not as smooth. I was really disappointed with this app, and I'm guessing the good reviews are from those who haven't played the good version. This game really felt like it was completely copied, from the job center, to the town, to the mini games and boyfriends with gifts. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone. If you like fashion games, download Star Girl. Don't waste your time with this one. I'm deleting it right now.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00AQM8H9I 2 1370390400 47 Despite there being instructions, every time I play, I somehow get it wrong. Maybe its just me, but I didnt have the patience to really figure it out. I gave it two stars just because my three year old likes to try to play, and likes penguins.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00FXKHEK6 4 1383436800 98 This game is relatively easy. Most of the characters I guessed right away...and I was surprised that I remembered half the cartoon shadows that I haven't seen in decades. I'm on level 87, and It took my only an hour to get that far. On the downside, I don't think I've guessed 87 silhouettes, so why I'm on level 87, beats me. Anyway, with the game going as fast as it has been going, I'm pretty sure it won't last long. I am stuck on some monkey picture, and its driving me crazy.Overall, cute app. Entertaining for now.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00A9NXGAO 4 1366848000 243 I have to admit that this game is a bit addicting, but it also caters to my OCD. In the beginning you have to search the streets for eggs with stars, but after a certain amount you cant find anymore. I do wish they would add more of those "hunts" to the game, though. I actually downloaded this game for my 8 year old but find that I play it much more.So now I'm adding this part of the review after having played the game for a while. You get to a certain point in the game where you need gems to buy anything cool. You can either patiently wait, earning the gems slowly, or you can, of course, buy them. After one of the first updates to the game, I ended up having to uninstall, then reinstall the game to get it to open. Unfortunately doing that made me lose clothes and even a boyfriend, that I'd already paid for/won. I still enjoy the game,but now that it's getting more popular, it feels like the publishers/creators are becoming greedier. I like the idea of the fashion competitions, but obviously in order to win, you have to spend good money/gems on advertising, as well as the most expensive clothes and accessories.I am glad that the newer updates constantly add new stuff, but at the same time the focus of the developers is becoming more and more money related, not so much fun related.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00BGC5UAG 2 1362960000 70 There are so many of these games out there now, its getting harder and harder to find one that is challenging...let alone one that you cant beat in just a few short hours. By the time you earn enough credits to use a hint, the game is over. Basically, just as you're getting into it, its over. Guarantee that you'll most likely delete it the same day you download it.
A13009KI5LAKNI B00AREIAI8 4 1362960000 272 I downloaded this app for my daughter because I was looking for a fun,realistic, horse game that she could play long term. For the most part, the game is self explanatory. You care for your horse, train it to enter competitions, and earn money to buy accessories, more horses, or other random things. Like most &quot;free&quot; games, this one also allows you to earn or purchase gems that you'll need for certain items or horses. While the game is enjoyable, there are a few things that keep me from giving this game five stars . First, you are given optional &quot;tasks&quot;. Like most free games, these tasks often cost more money or gems to complete then what you are rewarded with after completion. Also, while a majority of the game is self explanatory, some of the tasks, such as &quot;check your horse's shoes&quot; does not come with directions, and I have no way of figuring out how to actually complete this.For my daughter, the biggest complaint is that when you purchase more horses, they are not kept together in the corral. You have to switch from one horse to another to care for them. She really wanted to be able to see her horses run around together. Also, if you train one horse for a race, it automatically trains the other horse. Or if you are earning money with riding lessons with one horse, the other one cannot earn its own money. Basically, no matter how many horses you have, they pretty much are still just &quot;one &quot; horse. They share energy, money...just not a corral. Overall, its a pretty good game.
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00G357N92 4 1388361600 28 This is the best game I love it my mom got it and I love it I will always have it at the top of my game list
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00D3MWW44 5 1385683200 32 You are going to love this i always wanted to be a dolphin trainer sence I was 7and now I am 10 I recommend this for ages 5-100 I do not care
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00FW0JOJQ 5 1401667200 24 Verry fun game you will love it my friend showed me it and I like it and when I got home I downloaded it
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00A4EZ3QS 5 1395446400 21 It is the best. You would love it forever. I am addicted and just can't get enough. I love this game.
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00DYTKKGI 3 1378771200 20 It is not fun on the 2 round trough it is the same thing as it was th  first time
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00A4KVFLY 4 1373241600 34 This is my favorite game. But you have to have coins to play it. You get to swipe every day and get coins. Fast money round thou get to play twice for one coin
A1301T4MPFEBLC B00EQ2GBFG 3 1380499200 20 You do the Same thing over and over you hard to buy things to go on it is fun though
A13062CITIA3Y1 B00HAPRVWS 3 1393545600 23 I've always loved Sonic but this one needs some help to be playable. controls aren't registering so you really can't get anything done.
A13062CITIA3Y1 B00FHEP9XM 2 1393545600 79 I wanted to like this. I'd heard good things about it and had the beta version installed. i always had problems with the words it THOUGHT I wanted to type..You could turn off the word help I guess but I wanted it on if nothing else for accidental misspellings . It ended up constantly changing what I had typed to words so far off i was typing nonsense and things like email addresses and passwords Forget it..OMG the irritation.
A13062CITIA3Y1 B007KQ6XYY 5 1387238400 33 I don't play any games much but this one and the original are both great when you have a few spare minutes. the puzzles gradually get more challenging and the game is engaging.
A13062CITIA3Y1 B004RJMUJO 5 1387238400 23 My kids and husband also play this so it works for all ages. Nothing super challenging but good to kill a few minutes.
A13062CITIA3Y1 B007SN9TKE 3 1393545600 50 I had the free version and loved it, however the &#34;pro&#34; version is REALLY really slow. by the time a recipe loaded I'd already have given up and looked one up elsewhere. not sure what the problem is but waiting 10 minutes for a recipe to load is beyond ridiculous.
A1307931AO2G29 B006D1ONE4 5 1367280000 35 Just plain good fun to play. My great-niece spent a day with me and asked to play this on my Kindle. I have been hooked on it ever since SHE SHOWED ME how to play!
A1307931AO2G29 B004Q3CJQ0 5 1367280000 55 I no longer have to worry if there are batteries in my flashlight, as long as I have my Kindle charged, which I almost always do! I love, love, love this app. It's great for when I get up in the middle of the night and do not want the lamp to wake my hubby!
A1307931AO2G29 B008IJTFYW 5 1353369600 20 I especially like having the ability to combine the sounds I want! the built in timer is perfect for bedtime.
A1308L1T0VC0B1 B00BXL45G0 3 1365552000 21 This is a different type of bingo, it takes a minute to understand but it is fun to play with others.
A1308L1T0VC0B1 B00I10HCV6 4 1397433600 41 My niece's loves this game they  can't stop playing it.  They said the only thing is they have to keep login to Facebook to get one point to more on with the game. And they have all that on my F/B.
A1308L1T0VC0B1 B00A4KVFLY 5 1361923200 20 Great game with yourself or with family.. You play and think you are on the game show with Steve H.
A1308XK561JKV6 B0052UZIFA 1 1308873600 42 I love the game, but after a few games, it freezes up my phone and Eventually forces and reboot of my phone. I have a Droid Charge. I program for the living and I know this application has a memory leak.  Beware.
A1308XK561JKV6 B004Q6Y2LM 5 1306281600 31 Good thinking puzzle game. graphics are somewhat good. i think it's well worth the price. it's a swipe to move game. it has similar qualities as boxed in on the iphone.
A1309GJH856SYQ B004K4RY9M 4 1361923200 24 I liked it. It took a little bit to figure out how to make the word stay marked but after that, it was fun.
A1309GJH856SYQ B00KGCNRAM 5 1401753600 26 When I first saw it I thought &#34;oh boy, I will never be able to do this one&#34;, but I tried it and I love it.
A1309GJH856SYQ B00IEQDOLO 1 1398297600 22 There isn't even any list and/or pictures to know what you are looking for. I have already deleted it from my apps.
A1309VPFHLJGNG B00846GKTW 2 1337904000 23 it gets rid of your money realy fast and things arr to expinseve but other than that it is a pretty fun game
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00AEWUQG2 5 1356307200 37 I love it its just like the game. the only thing is I dont like to wait for the stars to build back up but I love it. its fun it gets ur brain going looooovvvveeee iitttt
A130CC6V8LB7GY B007Z4AKQI 5 1349827200 22 great totally fun when bored travelin to ur next hunt blab blah keeps me entertained but cash and credits thing is crap
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00BG3ID0Y 5 1363996800 29 I like this one. its kindof challenging. my whole family joins in on the fun we allntry to figure it out. if I don't get it some else will.
A130CC6V8LB7GY B004Z9Y3VY 5 1338422400 39 I love this app. it is for people that have a sense of humorous it hilarious I love it but I wish it was a little longer on the story I got a crack out of it. thank you
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00AF6MF9I 5 1385856000 44 this game is soooooo fun I love it I play with my fiance on this game. the only thing I do t like is of how much and how long you have to wait for a new area. other than that I LOVE IT.
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00C6RHC1A 4 1372809600 34 its like all of the other one but of when u need to take a cheat u only pay 20 to 40 coins on the game. its better then some that charge 200 coins.
A130CC6V8LB7GY B008JK6W5K 4 1345507200 30 I like it. its not that bad. if ur bored or something it good its just some of them are mainly Europe logosmaybe add some new brands in to there
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00BNH1PF8 4 1362700800 23 it keeps ur mind going. its fun to me its addicting. I get my whole family in on it. they like it too
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00702PZME 5 1364774400 20 this game is either matching or opposite. I like it. its pretty fun I get confused sometimes.  its all goods
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00A0XOT68 5 1357257600 38 I like it its easy fun its only Usa logos. very fun gets ur mind going. I don't like of how u have to pay to get bombs and light bulbs or go on to the next level
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00BPC23XO 5 1372723200 60 I really like of how it allows u to skip and go on to the next one and when it comes to it comes around again. I really like that. I think its nice easy but there are some hard ones. I go through 5 apps a week cuz I get bored kept this one for a month know. nice
A130CC6V8LB7GY B0075ASHQM 5 1334534400 37 I really like this app there's a lot of stupid but yet funny laws in there. its really funny I love it I just only read a couple and its awesome. I recommend this app to anyone.
A130CC6V8LB7GY B009UX2YAC 4 1359763200 23 Its fun. For a short while then get irritated that u don't have enough money to get stuff and or beat the missions.
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00B2TET3C 4 1361923200 35 I like it. its bingo. what I don't like is that if u accidently press bingo its automatic bad bingo. I feel its unfair. other then that fun easy at apretty good paste. fun fun
A130CC6V8LB7GY B0086700CM 4 1339286400 39 this app keeps you on ur toes it fun and exciting it just fun the monkey things r ugly and it takes a while to get to 5 thou. coins to buy something but other than that it fun
A130CC6V8LB7GY B00A4KVFLY 4 1357171200 25 I like its fun agree with people on the typing on the kindle and having to pay money. to play longer. otherwise I like it.
A130H4RI2UKF28 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392336000 20 I think flappy wings is a good game but my friends say that you can get dumb because of it.
A130VLKB0O95WZ B006OCM0G0 3 1357776000 90 I have bakery story and restaurant story and i love playing them but will probably uninstall them because amazon doesn't update these apps. Either i get an update way after everyone else or i don't get them at all. They never posted the christmas versions of either and it was no longer fun as i was the only neighbor without a lot of items. I never got any christmas dec and missed out on a new oven and all the holiday food. oh well it was fun for awhile. ;(
A130VLKB0O95WZ B007MRQOXQ 5 1339286400 35 i use this every day.it is very helpful so i don't have to search for hours for good or free reading books.i think this should be every new kindle users first download. It was mine'
A130VLKB0O95WZ B009OYODAG 1 1358985600 91 I wouldn't get any team lava games if your using a kindle you wont get the updates like everyone else does i got the halloween and thanksgiving ones but no christmas or valentines updates so gonna delete bakery story and restaurant story as team lava wont help with this and it is very unfair you will be really disappointed and frustrated that your neighbors all receive the new foods and decorations and you dont get ANYTHING! bye teamlava going to find my fun somewhere else where it is fair for all.
A130VLKB0O95WZ B0050KDTSK 1 1377129600 53 Been playing since feb every day now i cant says no longer supported?? Here we go again with teamlava and amazon!!Where is the updated version for kindle? Come on teamlava we know it is your fault i will never play another TL game again it's ridiculous what you put kindle users through ;(
A130W0DMKAY25K B007NACZPI 5 1332460800 24 it is similar to all the city and farming games. however it is a good game for my 2 yr old daughter to learn.
A130W0DMKAY25K B00A3HQX2Y 5 1355097600 29 I really like the game. The only problem is I had to start over when I got a new Kindle because it don't transfer. Otherwise I like the game.
A130W0DMKAY25K B006PH7WBM 5 1331942400 28 it is a fun a game. have lots of fun, the only thing is that some of the items should be less expel.expensive and not so many diamonds
A130W0DMKAY25K B00846GKTW 5 1337817600 24 this game is fun a lot better then other games like this. The only problem is getting coins and cash otherwise I like it.
A130W0DMKAY25K B0081IRIKI 5 1348876800 20 I downloaded this game cuz I couldn't play it on facebook for some reason. But I do enjoy this game.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00ABGEFWC 4 1398729600 28 Bought for my granddaughters, they love it, seems to have reasonable length of time before the need to buy things rises. As I said the girls love it.

A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00E994GPI 1 1393804800 20 Purchased this for my grandson, far too violent for a 6yr old that's for sure. Think classification should be clearer.

A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00H25P2JA 2 1396569600 22 The rating was not suitable for my grandchildren so it was deleted from my kindle so as to not take up space.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00ANH526W 2 1403395200 22 Requested by my 5yr old granddaughter, didn't hold her interest too long. Story line didn't connect for her. Usual buying of additions.

A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00H59CTW6 3 1403395200 25 Chosen by 5yr old granddaughter, did not hold her interest for long. This child sits through a 2hr movie so not an attention span issue.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00HTKA4N2 2 1396742400 26 One of these games that are set up to not give a buyer a chance to play for a short time without needing to buy.Wiped it
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B0087FDS22 2 1401667200 22 Downloaded by my 5yr old granddaughter. Looks very cute but was not interesting enough for her to keep it on her list.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00A3HQX2Y 3 1398988800 26 Bought for my granddaughters aged 3 and 5. The older girl likes playing this game more than the younger. Usual free component with payment for extra.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00IKZX1ZI 5 1396742400 22 Purchased for my grandchildShe loves it and it has numerous areas to be played with out the need to purchase much extra

A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00FMRWEAA 4 1398729600 25 Bought for granddaughters, older (5) is more interested. Fashion, make-up and clothes the main form of play. Usual buying of extras after not too long.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00IFXI4LQ 3 1398988800 21 Bought for an older grandchild, seemed to keep her occupied for reasonable time. Better than a few others she has tried.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B007Q3KX42 3 1401667200 25 Downloaded by my 5yr old granddaughter. Quite a cute little game, colourful and simple, hasn't played it for a while so doesn't keep the interest.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00I3D27CU 2 1396569600 22 I was disappointed with the fact that the new player didn't even get any chance to play a short time without paying.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00A8ECU24 3 1396569600 28 This was purchased for grandchildren and they liked it, to play further it needed to have purchases made.Should be made clear how much to have a decent game
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B005KCQZ2K 2 1399680000 21 Bought for my granddaughters, did not interest her after a very short time. Had to buy things quite soon as well.

A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B00C5A5B02 2 1401667200 20 Downloaded by my 5yr old granddaughter, Another game that did not seem to hold her interest for long. Was discarded.
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M B008TMA1LY 3 1401667200 32 Downloaded by my 5yr old granddaughter, she plays it every now and then. Seems to be simple and with a storyline that is frequently used. Think it with be a discard soon.
A1310GGXWO6FRY B004N2NWQ0 1 1377907200 23 Not worth the down load space. It's silly. Waist off time and energy. I do not recommend it to anyone. It's just silly.
A1310GGXWO6FRY B00AOA9BL0 2 1377907200 20 Maybe it's error but I have issues with this app. Can't get it to play properly and runs slowly.  :(
A1310GGXWO6FRY B0078SLMEU 3 1377907200 20 Used it for one drunken night of fun....not really worth a second use. It's ok but already deleted it :(
A1310GGXWO6FRY B009HKL4B8 5 1381968000 29 Some tasks take way to long....but still this is such a fun game! I highly recommend it and will probably get the full version for my pc soon! :-)
A1310GGXWO6FRY B007JYI4SU 1 1377907200 21 Like a scrappy cheap mood ring, this app six! Don't get it its not worth it. :( :( its very silly
A1310GGXWO6FRY B00AESN8XY 5 1401321600 23 I'm totally addicted to this game. Plays great on my android and kindle. Has many expansions but all cost $ (only draw back)
A1310GGXWO6FRY B00BYJ6BUO 5 1377907200 25 World ok with a strong g Wi-Fi connection otherwise shows will not run at all. Selection is limited. But it's an ok app I think.
A1310GGXWO6FRY B00EBE8MUG 4 1379462400 31 Basic and simple fun to play with with others!  Wish it was a little more interactive though . :)  haven't really played it enough to know if it's really that great
A1310GGXWO6FRY B00AHNC0SK 5 1391126400 39 Only on level 6 but so far, it's a fun game! :) easy to play and interactive.I am, however wondering if I have to buy tickets once I run out... don't like how limited u are on ride choices.
A1310GGXWO6FRY B007DLSWJ0 5 1377907200 22 A little repetitive and wish I could set it as my screen saver but always gets a smile. It's a cute app
A1312O6ZAW34CF B00768WTXA 3 1365033600 26 I like to find hidden items in pictures and I'm pretty good at it.  This one was a little hard.  The figures could be more defined.
A1312O6ZAW34CF B006Z0KKIG 4 1365033600 23 If you enjoy Mahjong you'll like this one too!  Great to play while waiting for an appointment or just relaxing in a chair.
A1312O6ZAW34CF B006OIK6JC 4 1365033600 25 It's fun to send one to family, friends or co-workers for any reason.  It brightens my day to receive an electronic card.  Brighten someone's day!
A1312O6ZAW34CF B007TO3JW6 2 1349568000 35 This game had too many problems with the action and getting free dollars.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Kept shutting down and when I got it back up all my winning dollars were gone.  Too bad.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008P1EWIM 5 1355529600 120 I LOVE, LOVE this app! It's visually stunning and elegant as the background of the information on the page displays a gorgeous sky from first light to sunset complete with clouds moving by. It displays a page for any city you choose and it is chocked full of information from wind speed to humidity to barometric pressure to forecasts. I have Rising Fawn, GA and Socorro, NM pages on my Kindle HD Fire 8.9", so apparently no city is too small to have its data displayed. I had to travel last week and it was a mighty handy and visually stunning companion on my trip. I highly recommend this app and it is well worth the pittance charged for it!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00JQ8TQ1G 5 1402790400 117 Earlier reviewers have been far more eloquent than I could ever be but I did want to rate this as a solid 5 stars. The graphics are gorgeous. Fog wafts by, dust motes float around, water drips and various creatures stir in every scene. It played without any glitches. Hint button recharges quickly. The map tells you where you need to go. The mini games are really fun and not horribly difficult, which I appreciate. The ho scenes are packed full and beautiful and enlargeable, which I also appreciate very much. The story is spooky and interesting  AND it is LONG. A great value!!! (Be sure to tap on the basket in the trailer ho). Top notch!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B009XFDFPU 5 1363824000 145 Great care has been taken on the design of each board on each level. They are intricate and diabolical! After playing many MATCH 3 games, I always come back to Wonderlines because the others bore me. The upper levels get harder and harder but you can play relaxed or timed. I breezed through the relaxed ones, but timed not so much- I'm stuck in a nadir at 44.There aren't any instructions, and I wondered for a long time what the hammer meant, but I did accidentally find out you could beat an offending ball with it and zip on by. There's a lot of strategy involved level to level. It's not all mindless in the timed mode.Music and graphics are wonderful and you get a TON of really great pyrotechnics when you get a match - really fun. Love this one more than any others!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00JJNT3MK 5 1401494400 171 This is right up there with Sacra Terra, Theater of the Absurd and Enigmatis Ghost of Maple Creek. But, it is an improvement over some of those because you don't have to run around endlessly; there is a wonderful map that shows you where you are AND where there are activities that need to be completed. Press on the location on the map where you want to go and voila, you're there!!! SUCH a great improvement over all the going back and forth. Great hint button that shows you the item in your inventory AND where it goes.This game is beautiful and the HO scenes are packed full. You can enlarge them without the loss of any resolution. The story is poignant and bittersweet about two star crossed lovers but told really well. This game is LONG with a long bonus chapter, too. Everything worked great on my KFHD 8.9&quot;. I can't say enough about this one. Definitely in the upper echelon. I hope more games will adopt the map feature!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00DRHY8EW 5 1377734400 61 Thank You, Big Fish!!!! I won't go into a great deal of detail; others have done it much better! But, if you love the great Fish HO GAMES, this is another great. Tons of play, GORGEOUS graphics, great storyline and puzzles. I thank the Fish for releasing this for Kindle Fire HD. I hope for more and will buy every one.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00640UICA 5 1378252800 128 This is a really, really cute game about darling little Peebles that want to hold hands. Each is contained in a hexagonal cell and they each vary in the number of hands they have...The challenge is to get ALL the hands joined, which requires some tricky maneuvering.The look, story and sound are superior and I can see how kids would LOVE this cute, cute game. Me, at 63, not so much although as the levels advance, the game gets harder as barriers appear in pivotal cells and make the hand-joining more difficult. I can see adults liking the greater challenge. I am too devoted an HO point and click fan! I got this as a FAOD to play with grandkids during holidays and I'm sure they'll love it.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B007T8Z5PG 1 1360022400 338 I sooooo wanted to give this 5 stars! The graphics are so great and I love the storyline a LOT, but towards the end, the graveyard gate with the 4-skull lock would not take my key so that I could dig up C. Marlow' s grave. I wanted to give this 5 stars so badly and I had to quit. This was such fun up to that point and I really regret not being able to finish. I was trying to play it on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9".NOTE: I turned off my kfhd and held the button down for 45 seconds or so to see if resetting things would help. And it did!!!! I returned to the graveyard and the skull lock accepted my key!!!! I've gotten further but then had a problem getting the church to accept the cross in it's place-holder and the candelabra, too, but they finally went with much trying, went through all the catacombs fine and now I'm off to the cannon game. It's very glitch-y, but I'm trying to see if I can finish. YES! I did finish and it is a wonderful game, but I am only going to go 1 star because it is very, very hard to play it on KFHD 8.9". You have to really want to make those items from you inventory interact with the setting they belong in and for some, the effort is not worth it. Otherwise - 5 Stars!HERE'S THE TRUE STORY: I wrote to the developer and told them what a bad experience Kindle Fire HD'ers were having with the game and they said that the game IS NOT FOR ANY OF THE KINDLE FIRES! All the positive reviews come from a non-Kindle platform. So, I told them that I thought they should pull them from Amazon's Kindle Apps instead of being perceived as a ripoff. Amazon should pull them from the KF App Store if Mumbo Jumbo won't!!!!! So, I hope this helps PREVENT folks from buying this app for KF's!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B004R13U6Y 5 1355961600 28 I am always having to read pdfs and this little app opens them perfectly on my Fire HD. I haven't had a problem and I use it often.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00FJYQUD8 2 1381104000 221 I wrote to Playrix yesterday and as always they were quick to respond. They are aware that the app closes when you try to buy the 2nd aquarium and they expect to have a fix in the next 2 weeks and will immediately make it available to us. So, keep your fingers crossed that we will soon be able to enjoy this great game to its fullest! Thanks to Playrix for a quick respone; if only G5 gave a damn about their games, I would buy more!THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THE FIRST AND 5-STAR REVIEW I HAD GIVEN THIS GAME. THIS REVISED REVIEW IS AS OF 10/14/2013: THIS APP WILL NOT LET YOU BUY ANOTHER TANK ON MY KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9". AS ANOTHER REVIEWER POINTED OUT, IT CLOSES WHEN YOU TRY TO BUY OR CHOSE ANOTHER TANK. I JUST FINISHED MY FIRST OF SUPPOSEDLY 3 TANKS TO DECORATE LAST NIGHT. TO BUY A SECOND AND THIRD TANK, YOU MUST ACCUMULATE $2,000.00 BY PLAYING THE MATCH-3 GAME. WHEN YOU TRY TO BUY THE 2ND TANK FOR 2,000.00, THE APP SHUTS DOWN. UNLESS THIS IS FIXED, I CAN NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS GAME. AS OF NOW, ON KINDLE FIRE HD 8.9", YOU CAN ONLY PLAY TO DECORATE 1 OF 3 AQUARIUMS. IT'S A SHAME!!!!!! I DID PAY THE $4.99 TO UPGRADE.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00BJA2VFW 5 1364688000 285 This game is just soooooooo cute and the graphics are OUTSTANDING! It's my runaway favorite Match 3 game of all time. You match 3 to win a stone with which to rebuild the city of the Hods, little Hobbit-y, elven, tropical, magical beings who live beneath the Tree of Life and which a demon destroyed.The match threes are so cute - an assortment of jewels, perfume bottles, lobsters, leaves, scrolls, fish, coins, plumes, oysters and more random things. But, they are rendered so brightly and are so cute, you just sort of can't wait to see the next batch.After you clear a board, you get a building stone. There are 100 levels with increasing levels of difficulty and power-ups. You can save your stones and build everything at the end, or use the stone you win at the end of each level to build a section of the tiny building...the Hods take your stone and hammer away and they're just darling.There are ALWAYS moves, you never get the "there are no more moves left" message, LOVE!!!!The graphics just glow and the little Hod huts and Tree of Life look like Russian iconography lit so beautifully and the rendering of the details like vines and the Hods themselves is so detailed...really a work of art and imagination.I only wish that you could disable the help; I like to look at things and on some of the more complicated boards, it takes awhile to look at everything and see what will move what. I would sooooooooo prefer a HINT button that you can activate at will like on the Fish HO games...still, this is the prettiest, most interesting and most fun Match 3 out there. Love it!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B0093QQCGI 5 1355529600 114 This app runs very, very well for me and I am able to access everything easily.the videos play fine and it's stuffed with news about everything from everywhere which was a pleasant surprise given that CNN usually features about 4 stories at the beginning of the day and runs them to death all day and all night long...it's very aggravating. But, this has in-depth reports about much, much more and fleshes out the story behind the tantalizing crawls they run under the reporter on TV. There are categories such as "Health" and "Entertainment" and no obnoxious ads. I recommend trying this app and it's free! I like this app, BBC and ABC's the most.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008IJT0CE 5 1355961600 84 This little app works great and is better than some of the others because you can combine many sound options together to create your special, custom "sound." Some of the other ambience apps will only combine 3 sounds together. This one is a better choice. I have combined several sound options which I play at night: rain, wind, melody, heartbeat and windchimes. You can make many others! The only thing I can complain about is the lack of a "frog" sound. I love frogs!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00AEC8UVU 5 1373932800 252 If only I could give this one 50 stars !!!!! It's the very best tile matching game, and maybe the best game for the money, ever made! At 5$ it would have been a bargain. There are not enough superlatives to describe this game.Play timed or not and match the most beautiful, luminescent, tiles ever created, in complex layouts with the tiles stacked sometimes 6 and 7 deep. You are given the tiles to be matched from the array in a holder at the bottom of the page. Each time you make a match, that tile disappears from the holder and is replace by another. Coins are given for matching 4 or more like tiles on the same turn and with the coins you can buy WONDERFUL powerups - and believe me, you will need them as the levels increase in difficulty.There are games and games with this app; I have been playing over a month and not been bored for 1 second. There are 3 sets of beautiful tiles to choose from. If only games of this caliber were common. But, this is one in a million! Perfectly gorgeous, great premise, tons of fun; even good music(!) and game play that goes on and on...More PLEASE? I really would be happy to pay 7 or 8$ for another one like this or of this quality - it's that good!Plays smoothly and glitch free on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9". It is truly a wonderful, WONDERFUL game and cheap at any price!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B0058EBNAO 5 1357603200 60 A wonderful app that does everything it says it will do. It's beautiful on my Kindle Fire HD and runs perfectly every time. I really depend on this when tornadoes are predicted. I won't go into all the details about it as others have done that job perfectly..I have not had a moment's problem with this app. I love it.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008BM3TKM 5 1358726400 276 This is one of the very best mystery games out there for Kindle Fire HD 8.9", resplendent with HO scenes, clues and tools you can earn by solving puzzles and finding hidden objects to help you with your mission. Of this genre, this is one of the very best for any price. It is mesmerizing in graphic elements, atmosphere, and foreboding storyline. It played flawlessly and it took me about 5 hours, but I'm not in it for the speed...I love to linger and look at all the beautiful graphics and incredible details. The hints and games are great and there is also a journal and strategy guide to help you if you get stuck.  The hos are zoom-able and gorgeous and so interesting in their content. This is the first game that I actually couldn't work some of the puzzles!!! Don't worry; you can skip them. There is a little more running around than normal in this game, but the graphics are so good that I loved looking at each venue as I passed.I want to just say that I really, really thank and appreciate Big Fish for creating this game to play on KFHD and I wish there were so many more! I wish folks would take that fact into consideration when reviewing some of these games and being hypercritical of small flaws...This one has NONE and I would have paid a lot more for it. I hope many, many more people buy it and write Big Fish Entertainment to ask for more! Loved this experience; it is so much fun. I have bought Empress of the Deep II abd can't wait to start!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00B2W289G 5 1359072000 563 This is a quirkier game than others by Big Fish that I have played. I am about 4 hours into it and there has been A TON OF PLAY!!! And it has run flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" with great zooms, saves my place reliably when I leave, no freezes and the only thing I will say about the ho scenes is that some are really HARD, which I love, because they are chocked full of stuff and some are very well camouflaged with the background...you really do have to look on the zoom, but I have found all of the objects so far. There aren't any below the bottom inventory bar. The graphics are just amazingly rendered and beautiful! Even if they are gross!!!! Each scene is just gorgeous like all Big Fish I have played and that's why I love them so much! And the story is really good, too.I REALLY, REALLY dislike the sarcastic remarks that ensue when you try the wrong tool for the job...they are derisive and really detract from the game's great atmosphere of dread and fear. Interjecting these remarks takes you out of the moment.The puzzles are difficult and I do wish there was a walkthrough within the story. There is a journal that is really useful with locations, secret numbers and signs and hints, but not for the puzzles; BUT you can skip them...whew! I just could NOT figure one of them out.There are a few humorous little clues that enchant! And some very cute animal animations. Just darling!I give this 5 because it is very long and intricate and has worked fine for me. It's difficult, but not impossible to solve the puzzles and I just love the look of it and the way it works. It has a strong story and MANY LOCATIONS, each beautifully rendered. The ho's are just incredibly lovely and complicated. It has a LOT OF PLAY. Take away the sarcastic remarks and it is perfect for me so far...will update this at the end. I want to add a plea for more of these games...I just love this mystery ho genre and hope that BF will give us Kindle folks some more!ADDENDUM: Just finished...have about 20hours in it but I love to linger over puzzles and take in all the GORGEOUS graphics...it's just visually stunning! It was just a work of art. The ho's are amazingly crafted and chocked-full and zoomable and get harder as the search goes on.There is only one CON: There is no help and the "Crime Computer" inventory hint system does not work 90% of the time and in any event, it only shows you a tiny "photo" of what the item you try to drop on it from your Inventory is used for. So, I got stuck and I mean really stuck about a third of the way in. I missed a pivotal clue and I just could not find where I'd gone wrong no matter how many times I went back and forth. I had to resort to the very excellent online walkthrough on Gamezebo to figure out what I'd done wrong. All was then GREAT! I just LOVE this game! But if there weren't help online, I couldn't have finished it. So, I wish there were a in-story hint system like on most of the other wonderful Big Fish Games.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B0067Q4RCI 5 1361059200 313 This was so much fun! A new approach to ho scenes in that you have to find several "Key Objects" in order to find the other ho items needed to complete a task. The locations are interesting and all the hidden objects relate to the story and are of the period, which I really like. The ho scenes are chocked full of fun stuff very well disguised. Yes, some of the objects in a couple of instances are below the inventory bar, but you can pinch and zoom and find them or a portion of them that is recognizable enough to select. I found them all and it was not a problem for me at all. If you do get stuck, there is a great Hint button.There is a wonderful journal that tells you where to go and you can't possibly get lost or come to a screeching halt because you can't figure out where to go next or what to do. Each scene tells you when it is completed so you don't have to keep going hither, thither and yon a hundred times. The puzzles are pretty simple, but keep you on your toes. I was able to work them all, but there is a skip option. This ia a great little game and took me several hours over the week and I consider it, at $2.99 to be a GREAT BUY!!! The story is fine for kids, too. No gory stuff. The only time I got a little exasperated was in the cave of the Native Chief. He kept telling me to "Clear the trail," and he might have said, "Raise the trellis." to have been of more help. I figured it out by going back a step to the previous location and getting help.I highly recommend this one as lots of fun with great HO's! More games like this, PLEASE!?
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00EHKJ60E 1 1396656000 288 I am an unabashed fan of Fairway Solitaire and have been eagerly awaiting this. I have not been disappointed! This is a little more hyper with bombs and machine gun toting gophers that blast away at cards, jet propelled worms that drag cards off the board and rocket riding gophers that carry cards away. You play various, progressive courses and there are incentives and rewards along the way. Fail to get the necessary points and you must replay that hole. It's great fun and strategy is definitely involved.The game gets progressively more difficult and you are offered power-ups for purchase with real money from the Amazon app store. It's your choice;  I'm on level 38 and as a general policy, refuse to buy add-ons, but they are NOT necessary in order to enjoy this game!  There is plenty of play and replay value here. The graphics are great and cute, too. This is a ton of fast and furious solitaire with a serious sense of humor!!!!!UPDATE AS OF APRIL 8th:As you can see, I fell for this game, hard. I had the option of buying power-ups, but I didn't think they were necessary in order to progress - WRONG! IT is impossible to progress beyond course 2, Emerald Isle, hole 25, without buying more cards. This game has at least 100 levels and in order to progress, I can see that it would quickly get VERY, VERY expensive. With great regret I deleted it from my KFHD. Hate that Big Fish feels the need to take advantage of its loyal customers. Why not sell this game outright for $4 or $5? I would gladly have paid it! At best it is shady; at worst it is just dishonest.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B007ZQK1MY 1 1360022400 31 I have corresponded with this maker and they are NOT designed to run on any of the Kindle Fires. WHEN READING REVIEWS, NOTE WHAT KIND OF DEVICES THEY ARE PLAYING ON!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008EL25LE 3 1371686400 61 This is a match 3 with beautiful graphics and what could be an interesting premise but it is TOTALLY RUINED by a less-than-lame storyline. The story is nonsensical, stupidly crafted and just silly. It's a shame they couldn't match their wonderful graphics with a great story. For the lame story, I give it only 3 stars. Too bad; it's very expensive.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00AEJPK0C 5 1369440000 306 Amazingly, this game is free!? It's a fast-paced match 3 with the twist being that the jewels are on hexagonal grids and move on the diagonal up, down and sideways. For a point of reference, my very favorite games are: Wonderlines, Fishdom, Around the World in 80 Days, Treasure of Montezuma 3, and Atlantis...and this one, but I must have hexagonal dyslexia because I have a lot of trouble beating this one and moving up the levels. I guess I just don't see things diagonally! But, I play it all the time because it's a wonderful little game with a good challenge, graphics and sound and I think I may be becoming more accustomed to seeing on the diagonal, which keeps my brain growing cells, I hope :-)There are lots of pyrotechnics, bombs and lightenings and you have to beat the clock and break the brown tiles by repeatedly matching over them to move on to the next level. There are a gazillion levels, too and the grids are laid out in different diabolical designs with locked jewels dotting the array of jewels. There is nothing to buy and the ads are in a TINY, UNOBTRUSIVE quarter-inch by 2 or 3" block at the bottom of the screen over the name of the game so I never even see them! It does occasionally ask you to rate it, but not often and that never bugs me. I don't know how a paid version of this app could be any better!!! And, what app can you say THAT about? I like this app better than many I've paid for because you really have to think on your feet, it's fast and it is NOT boring and repetitious at all.This plays flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" and I highly recommend it for all Match 3 fanatics!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008M87GJK 5 1355961600 44 This works just fine for me on my Fire HD...Looks great and sounds great...no problems. It has the standard indices and they open right up. I have many, many news apps and this one is reliable and a great addition to my news apps.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00C5HW022 5 1380240000 227 Easily in the top 5 games of this genre. Gorgeous graphics and an interesting if macabre storyline. I have played many, many games of this type and for the price, this one takes the cake!Play is very long and hooked me in at the start. The environments are just beautiful and intricate, I enjoyed lingering over each scene. they were each little, individual works of art. I looked forward to playing this every night for a week and that's rare for me.This game is not without a couple of glitches, though. I had to try, try, and try again to place some objects. I almost gave up in the armory, but tried placing the object and holding it in place for a few seconds and it suddenly fell into place. I was so glad!The Hints, map all worked fine. For the clock settings: there's an excellent walkthrough on Gamezebo. I couldn't figure that one out, either.As for the ending. I did think it was a glitch and did not "get" that it was the beginning of the bonus chapter! Thank you to a reviewer who pointed this out. I will play this to the end, again, and then keep playing.This all being said, this is an exquisite game that I would have paid $10 for. Alawar, please give us a sequel and more games of this caliber!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B0067R8JNK 5 1357171200 56 Fast and fun, you get points for making words out of a jumble of letters against a timer. You move the letters by touching and moving them to form words, a clean screen really helps. Challenging and a ton of fun. My favorite and it has a good look and interface on my Kindle Fire HD.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008DWM0QY 1 1360281600 179 Will NOT play on Kindle Fire HD. Too bad because what I could see of it was very good and the graphics were beautiful and the "wide screen" view was novel. I got to play until I got to the top of of the tower but it had already frozen twice and the sound would go out and intermittently burst on. At the tower, it froze again and I just gave up not wanting to start over a fourth time. No matter how attractive, I know by now when I'm whipped trying to play a game billed for KFHD that really isn't!I  wish Amazon would get with Big Fish and G5 and cut deals so we could play the quality games on KFHD; world's greatest games on world's most beautiful display would truly be a winning combo. Then, I think the KFHD really wouldn't have competition from other tablets. And yes, I hate that I paid $4 for it. It was working so well at first, but it started failing almost immediately after I paid for it - figures!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00DGMVC4C 5 1371772800 171 This is a fast, fast Zuma-type game, match 3, bubbleshooter. What separates it from the rest of like games are it's GORGEOUS graphics, smooth and responsive movements and FANTASTIC power-ups. I bought this because I LOVE Sparkle, the original, but this one takes a fun, fast, pretty game and really makes it great!This game is much like Treasures of Montezuma 3 in look and feel and that is high praise, indeed! Treasures of Montezuma 3, Wonderlines and all the Playrix games have been my favorites games until this one. Games of this caliber are sadly few and far between. In this instance the high price is more than justified unlike their game, Azkend 2, which is completely nonsensical. The developers have left no stone unturned in making Sparkle 2 a visually arresting, exciting, smooth-playing and responsive game with lots of play and replay value. I hope there will be a Sparkle 3 and more because this is a winning formula for a game! Thank you, 10tons. Beautiful and so much fun!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00AKJRPC2 5 1358467200 175 The graphics are AWESOME and the story is fun! I was absolutely lost at first but the onscreen guides, hints and other resources finally got me up and going and I was able to catch on really fast. The HO screens are intricate and beautifully done and I especially loved this aspect of the game. The locations were eerie and haunting with lots of smoke and fog and twinkling and so much detail...just beautiful. I loved playing along with this and the puzzles were do-able and once I caught on, I was fine. The atmospherics, renderings, objects and details created a great spooky atmosphere and the music enforced it. Did not have a single glitch from download to end of game. I performed flawlessly on my KFHD 8.9" and the HO screens zoom!!! Had a great time and it is WELL WORTH the money!!!! I only wish there were tons more of Big Fish games for KFHD like this one because I love it! I would buy them all this one is so much fun!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00BNJGZBK 5 1364169600 312 This is a full-on HO "game." A mother must find her 2 children trapped in a magic mirror by finding shards of broken mirrors surrounding the magic mirror in order to mend them. In order to get shards, she must go from scene to scene within each broken mirror and find the hidden objects. Then, place the "finished" objects created out of the ho's in the correct place in the scene. You might find clock workings and put them together and place them in the clock in another scene. As her reward for finding and placing objects she gets the mirror shards to mend that particular mirror with. Then we move on to the next broken mirror.Each broken mirror has a theme and they are interesting and their hidden objects go with the theme. The graphics, as usual with Big Fish games, are beyond beautiful. There is tons and tons of ho play and the scenes are all zoomable and the objects are all there above the inventory bar. Hints work great, thank goodness!This is a novel approach to an ho game. I haven't seen one like it. It asks you to find objects, then assemble them, then place them in the scene. The scenes take a while and that really makes me happy. I don't like them too easy. If you love ho games, this is a really good one. Maybe the theme is a little scary, but it would be a great one to play with kids or grandkids helping to find the objects...and there are plenty of them AND they are interesting!You get a ton of play then you are asked if you would like to play more and to pay to upgrade if you do. You are given way more than enough play to make a judgment about this game and for me, it was so worth it!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B004FOA84A 3 1359072000 153 This is really a simplistic type of format...few locations and a TON of running around in them. The movement is a little clunky and some of few locations are only used once. The look was ok, nothing froze or went wrong on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9" The reason for the 3 stars, which is in itself abstract, is that there is no help. If you get stuck, you're on your own OR you have to resort to the internet walkthrough. Not fun for me. Even with the help online, I quickly realized that I would never have figured some of the puzzles, clues and their use or finished this game. For me, maybe it's more like a 1-star, but I know this game has a cult following of obviously clever folks who are able to solve the clues and I want to encourage all game makers to give us Kindle people MORE!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008KPB8P8 5 1355443200 39 I really love this app on my Kindle Fire HD because it gives a good overview of a lot of news...not just a repetition of 1 or 2 stories all day long. It is updated frequently and has photos.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00B0419YG 5 1361059200 212 A Hidden Object purist's perfect game!!! It is just wonderful and a novel way of doing hos. Each hidden object scene is chocked full of objects that relate to the story and to every location it travels to. Like all of Big Fish games, they objects are beautiful and perfectly visible if some are disguised very well with their surroundings! Each time you get to a ho scene, there are several "Key Objects" you must start with and each time you find one, they require you to find several other hos before you can obtain the object you need to complete a task. It's so much fun!The story carries its weight, too, complete with Igor from "Young Frankenstein" and a very feisty young worman, our heroine. There are hours of play in very attractive settings and as these games go, it is very easy to navigate and to figure out what to do and where to go next. It's also very cute and would be fine for kids up to 100. Great hints, saves your place reliably. I had a perfect experience.I hope Crystal Portal number 3 comes out soon because I'll be first in line! Thanks Big Fish for another GREAT one!!!! I wish there were 50 more like this one.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B0055DL1G4 1 1355529600 112 You know, I love NBC news, but this thing will NOT work for me. The key to everything is to pick a news topic from the index, which is the peacock's tail from the NBC logo. Each "feather" on the tail has a topic on it and when you touch the topic it is supposed to take you to a full page of news stories. Trouble is, when I touch some of the feathers, they don't open the topic I'm touching! I have tried and tried to open "Health" by touching it's "feather" but have not succeeded, yet. I am deleting this app because of it's non-existent functionality. Is it just me?
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00BI3AFPI 5 1362441600 236 How do I love thee, let me count the ways...What a great game!!! THIS BABY HAS IT ALL. It's the quintessential Big Fish games. The storyline is about a mysterious hitchhiking girl who disappears. We go looking for her in a mysteriously abandoned town's rubble. It's a grungy, dirty, grimy and bloody place replete with ghosts and demons and children in dire straits. Like all Big Fish games, this one is of the very highest caliber. HOS are great and nothing is below the inventory bar and they're zoom-able without loss of resolution and the graphics are all superb. But, This is NOT a pretty game; in fact, it's downright revolting times. It was a shock after Lost Souls, Enchanted Paintings, which is gorgeous.Hints and walkthrough within game. Neat flashlight, which works great and camera, too - a great, creative little touch. TONS of play and a bonus chapter that goes on and on. Great replay, too. I would say this is probably a good one for those with a few under their belt. This is most like Enigmatus to me, but a LOT better!!!! Would have paid MORE. Fish, make more and make them REALLY, REALLY long...I would pay lots more for more! FANTASTIC!The only other thing I would advise is to be a little insistent with placing some items. They will all go in their places but some need a little tap or two!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00CF6I3X8 1 1367280000 89 I adore match 3 games like TREASURE OF MONTEZUMA, WONDERLINES, FISHDOM, AROUND the WORLD IN 80 DAYS and ATLANTIS, but this one just completely missed me. You tap and tappy tap on little clusters of like objects and they drop off the screen and you get gold coins.  The objects are tiny and hard to see or distinguish different shapes, but it didnt matter since you tap the away. By the 3rd 4th level I was SOOOOOOOOO BORED. I DON'T GET IT. Maybe this is one for the kids???
A1314P8MTIGN5J B008O661PK 5 1359849600 253 What a PLEASUREABLE experience!! What fun, purely and simply FUN! I know some reviewers think this story is cheesy, but really, what's cheesy about saving the oceans and freeing people from its pollution and destruction...it's an allegory.As with all Big Fish games, this one is drop-dead gorgeous; each venue a work of art that I have become accustomed to from this game creator. The concept is so much fun! The story is imaginative, sweet and lively and the characters are very well-drawn. The hidden object screens do not zoom, however, the objects are very visible and I was able to find them all. Nothing is below or off the sides of the screen. I ran this on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and it was flawless. It saved my place every time I had to leave it. It also has an EXCELLENT in-app help and hint system and map. You can't get lost or miss a clue.This game would be such a sweet one to play with your kids or grandkids...It is such a kid-friendly story. But, I'm very much an adult (at 62!) and I loved seeing and anticipating every frame of this game; what's not to love about a bunch of darling marine creatures brought to life so charmingly? Similarly, I think this would be a great starter game to introduce someone to this genre of game. I would gladly have paid much, much more for this one! It's wonderful! Please send us number 3 of this series, soon?! Can't wait!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00B4VI8MQ 5 1360972800 302 This is another winner from G5!  It's simple and a good one for a beginner who might like to try total immersion in the genre of hidden objects games. No tricky moves, no misdirection, a minimum options of directions and a guide, so you can't get lost or grind to an untimely halt. And, make no mistake, this game is ALL ABOUT THE HO SCENES. The "story" is an afterthought. The graphics are very, very good and the ho scenes are NUMEROUS and chocked full of stuff - like if you went to the nearest dumpster and dove in. But, the items are all there and when you pinch to zoom, you can see them all, even those rare ones that hide under the inventory bar at the bottom. Luckily, the Hints are impeccable and work every time. And, I had to use them more than once, I'm ashamed to say. I spent hours on these hos! They're really, really good. The only thing I prefer about Big Fish Games is that their ho objects usually relate to the story and are of that period. No matter, this is a ho lover's dream game with PLENTY of play (yes, I upgraded and it was soooooo worth it)!!!!The somewhat lean story is macabre, but interesting, about Amazonian curses, jewels and a missing girl. I love ho games and I found this very challenging. For all you ho junkies, this is a great one for you! This played flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9". If you leave it and restart it, when the game starts playing from the beginning, press the back arrow and it will take you right where you were when you stopped the last time. VERY, VERY GOOD GAME! Support our game developers so we can have more like these!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00631HASU 5 1378252800 97 This is a Zuma-like game. Long lines of balls snake around and you have to shoot like colors down matching them with the color of the ball in your cannon. The patterns are intricate and difficult at higher levels and they are timed. The graphics are just gorgeous and there's a story, too. TONS OF PLAY!!! A great game, if a tad smaller than it's sibling, Sparkle 2. These are the best of the Zuma games out there and they are FAR and AWAY the very best. I highly recommend these for fast, pretty and challenging play.
A1314P8MTIGN5J B009ZHQLHA 5 1362182400 261 This is easily the prettiest game I've ever played and maybe one of the most fun! If you liked Empress of the Deep 1 & 2,  or Ravenhearst you'll love this. The story is great, too, but as gorgeous as this game is, it's just a super bonus.The ho scenes are chocked full of topical objects fully visible and none below the inventory bar. The zoom feature works great without loss of resolution. Hints work great, too. Puzzles are good but do have a skip option. Really runs perfectly and smoothly.I really, really wish the whiners who don't want to pay for his game would just shut up, already! It's pretty good bet that if a game tells you it is set up to take cash that you will have to pay for something!!!! No one is holding a gun to your head to make you buy it. This game gives you more than plenty of time to decide whether or not you want to buy more! In this instance I paid 4.99$ to upgrade from within the game and I would gladly have paid MORE!!!!This game has it all...it's visually stunning, has a great story, no glitches whatsoever, hours of play and replay AND is a superb value! I loved the fact that you CAN'T get stuck or too confused because the game tells you when you have completed a scene. This is a GREAT GAME, certainly one of the very best out there and would be fun to play with kids or grandkids, too! Can't say enough about it!
A1314P8MTIGN5J B00A77II0U 5 1358726400 219 This is one of the very best mystery games out there for Kindle Fire resplendent with HO scenes, clues and tools you can earn by solving puzzles and finding hidden objects to help you with your mission. Of this genre, this is one of the very best for any price. It is mesmerizing in graphic elements, atmosphere, creepiness and storyline. It played flawlessly and it is very long...it took me about 7 or 8 hours, but I'm not in it for the speed...I love to linger and look at all the beautiful graphics and incredible details. The story is macabre. The hints and games are great and there is also a journal and strategy guide to help you if you get stuck.  The hos are zoom-able and gorgeous and so interesting in their content.I want to just say that I really, really thank and appreciate Alawar for creating this game to play on KFHD and I wish there were so many more! I wish folks would take that fact into consideration when reviewing some of these games and being hypercritical of small flaws...This one has NONE and I would have paid a lot more for it. I hope many, many more people buy it and write Alawar to ask for more! Loved this experience; it is so much fun.
A1315GTTL8IPR B004O9G750 1 1384732800 25 mindless, and boring not much else to say about this game  glad that I didn't have to pay for it and it was a freebee

A1316FBN61E6XS B00G357N92 5 1389916800 22 I enjoy these cooking games.  Fun to play and I can see my daughter also enjoy playing this.  Graphics are done well.
A1316FBN61E6XS B006D1ONE4 5 1325980800 23 My daughter loves playing this game. It is great because it really makes her think.  We both enjoy this game. Lots of fun.
A1316FBN61E6XS B00BW08XRO 5 1390089600 24 I really enjoy playing this game. Graphics are really cool.  The only thing I wish the cost was a little lower for the upgrade.
A1316FBN61E6XS B0054JZC6E 5 1338422400 24 I like all the different games.  They are fun to play. Fun trying to beat all the games and earn points to open more.
A1316FBN61E6XS B007SYWFRM 4 1337904000 90 I have this app for my Kindle Fire.  I like to read reviews before I download any app.  Thanks to those who shared on how to get out of the game.This game reminds me of Farmville and other games like that.  My only problem with this game is that I can''t visit friend's villages.  It says it has to update the game everytime I try to.  It can be glitchy at times and has crashed a few times.  The game is ok just fix the issue with visiting friend's villages.
A131B5TICTEJH9 B0060I3IJG 5 1395619200 54 This is an app that takes you in a tour around the web with a simple swipes and clicks, but there's a bit mess while swiping left or right, I may want to change the page, or just crawl to some other part of the page, it this is handled, it would be great.
A131B5TICTEJH9 B004SD5GZ4 4 1391299200 24 It sometimes lags heavily, but it's useful for reading PDFs, taking notes, comments and highlights, would have been much better if fixed the lag.
A131B5TICTEJH9 B008K6HN8I 4 1395619200 22 There's a bug, I can't re-chose my background image. Other than that, It's really useful for my Kindle, helps organizing things around
A131B5TICTEJH9 B008P1EWIM 5 1396828800 19 This app is accurate, up to date, and it looks just stunning with real nice high definition backgroundsWell recommended
A131B5TICTEJH9 B005TBWN0K 3 1391299200 24 I use it for free hand sketching, it's good but sometimes it closes without even giving a crash message, would be great if fixed.
A131B5TICTEJH9 B004LZF2LW 5 1395619200 55 This is one of the most apps I really needed to have, I never knew it existed, I compete online and I have to keep track of the time difference between many countries and time zones.This app also shown sunrise and sunset times, and give a live simulation for the time all over the world.

A131BEMMX2I1H9 B007HQKSOS 4 1360972800 54 Ok, this game seems so fun but on my kindle fire when I turn it on its side it goes completely the other way! Please fix that it's really annoying I really want to play this game but I guess not well I deleted it because it's not fun when it's upside down -_-
A131BEMMX2I1H9 B00FMRWEAA 3 1381795200 51 I downloaded this game and I was so excited I played on it for about 10 minutes or so and stopped for a while. Got back on and my hair was gone! It didn't show on my person! SORRY BUT I THINK Star Girl is better than Star Girl: Beauty Queen
A131BEMMX2I1H9 B0070O973K 4 1357430400 54 Ok when I got this game I started to polish the poo but then my finger started burning and it hurt but the game is fun still just it hurts when I rub my screen be careful!!! And it's really funny!!!!!! He's all shiny when I'm done I started laughing because who polishes poo?!
A131BEMMX2I1H9 B007HIM53I 4 1360886400 50 I love this game it's really good. But when you make the drinks and then you leave the app and go to a different one and go back to the app all the drinks are gone and you have to make more! Is that suppose to happen? Four stars only.....
A131CRIH83FS0Q B00A4EZ3QS 4 1355875200 30 For an adult, there is not a lot of thinking required to play this game.  I think my 3 yearold grandson has more fun playing this game than I do.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B009G9KFQ0 5 1402876800 52 Great and accurate source of weather information.  Alerts are automatically posted.  It also has maps and radar information and I can check other localities.  Great for previewing upcoming vacation spots and knowing what kind of weather friends and family members are having.  I like the 10 day forecast and the hourly forecast.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B008KPB8P8 1 1390953600 20 I could not figure out how to get local news and weather.  There were no instructions or help options available.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B00IS87HYI 5 1401926400 88 I was glad to see Pet Rescue Saga FINALLY made it to my Kindle Fire.  I enjoy playing the game and waited forever to get it to my Kindle.  The graphics are very clear, and the games go fast.  what I like with this and other King games is that if someone sends you lives and yours are full, it will wait until you have used all your lives before giving you more.  My desktop version doesn't do that.  If it is full, you lose all other &#34;gifts&#34;.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B008GUNBOI 1 1347494400 30 Could not get it to work on my Kindle Fire.  It kept taking me to purchase the whole game.  My granddaughter was VERY disappointed.  I removed it from my device.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B004W7Z14W 1 1342483200 36 I was looking for a simple calendar to use on my Kindle Fire for everyday type of reminders.  I downloaded this program but could not install because I received a message that the file was corrupt.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B0064X7B4A 5 1402876800 24 I enjoy playing this game; however, every once in a while I have to remove it and reinstall it because it gets hung up.
A131CRIH83FS0Q B009UX2YAC 3 1402876800 20 My four year old grandson found this on my Kindle Fire.  He enjoys playing it.  It's fun and also fast.
A131E9IR67XE4I B00I0WIUHK 3 1404950400 109 This game is fun, and the graphics are pretty, but like all slots, the &#34;payout&#34; isn't great.  I think the goal of most of these &#34;free&#34; slots apps is to get you to buy coins/gems/tokens...  I want to play FREE slots for fun, so with this game, I don't usually get to play very long.  You get 100 free coins every 5 minutes or so (which doesn't really mean anything since you have to bet so low), and you get 800 or more coins every 4 hours.  If you want to wait and build up your coins, and then see if you can &#34;win big,&#34; it could be fun.
A131E9IR67XE4I B0098BGYM0 5 1389657600 37 This app is wonderful.  It's free (with the little ads at the bottom) and the tabbed notebooks with unlimited pages give you a lot of options for storing notes/documents and organizing in any way you want.  GREAT!
A131E9IR67XE4I B005ZFOOE8 3 1389657600 31 iHeart Radio is an okay alternative to Pandora, but I will always prefer Pandora.  I have an account with iHeart Radio, so I figured I might as well download the app.
A131EHQI8PDIIJ B00846GKTW 5 1348963200 25 if u like fashion runway shows this is app for u I enjoy this app time well spent so download like it check it out
A131EHQI8PDIIJ B00BW08XRO 5 1374883200 22 if you like time management games &amp; apps - your going to love this app!!!!  fun for adults as well a children
A131EHQI8PDIIJ B00GIZO674 5 1385424000 23 about time they finally got this app had it 4 my pc now I hav it 4 my kindleplz get won't refer it
A131EHQI8PDIIJ B00GGOVTN6 5 1400544000 43 This app is free &amp; fun that comes with it is priceless. Great fun very addictive !! Real fashion real pieces u can buy online on n ure everyday stores . From pocketbooks to hats u name it . Absolutely love this game
A131FGCQKYM3HJ B00FYEPQWO 2 1388361600 28 Not a bad app but some of the controls on the weapons are shown on the wrong side. All in all not too bad for a free app.
A131FGCQKYM3HJ B00FELZD70 2 1402272000 33 This game would be better if it didn't kick you off every time it updated and make you start all over again. I've gotten up to level 51 and had to start over.
A131H924URRBP0 B00FAPF5U0 5 1394323200 41 This game truly keeps me engaged, I am now moving to another level but the game won't let me progress without going thru additional trails.  I was stuck on 1 level for many, many week.  But I really enjoy this game!
A131H924URRBP0 B00BQ2OX86 2 1374019200 30 I enjoyed solving the puzzles I could work on but because if was only a preview, I wasn't able to really get into the games but I did enjoy playing.
A131H924URRBP0 B007USZX7U 4 1403481600 30 I really like playing Mahjong.  I'm teaching my granddaughter how to play it.  Sometimes I get confused with the different types of cards but overall a GREAT game to play.
A131H924URRBP0 B00FEIX5OG 4 1403481600 47 I like to play this game for relaxation but when I start getting too many connections with the jewels it will lock up my Kindle and then I have to wait until it runs out before I can restart my Kindle.Great game and lots of BANGING fun!
A131H924URRBP0 B005HXUSS4 3 1394323200 25 I use Marble Maze to aid my Granddaughter in here ability to use her thinking and move quickly.  She and I both enjoy this game.
A131H924URRBP0 B005ZXWMUS 1 1394323200 22 Never used this program and I only watch movies on TV so this was not something I enjoyed.  Maybe some other time.
A131IR0L5RYTHH B008FRA5LY 1 1342569600 34 Eh.... I'm sorry but this is a WASTE OF TIME. Its quite rediculous! There is like 7 logos! That's NOT enough! DO NOT -- I REPEAT -- DO NOT GET THIS TERRIBLY HORRID APPLICATION!!!!!
A131IR0L5RYTHH B00529IOXO 3 1344470400 42 it was a really good app that notified you whenever you got a text but it was sort of slow receiving texts. but that was fine in my opinion. but now I got the update and its faster just no notifications. ugh.
A131IR0L5RYTHH B00820STKI 5 1341619200 36 This is a really cute and fun app! It was raining on the fourth, so it was great to have fireworks indoors!;) I really like this app as there are many different games on it. :)
A131IR0L5RYTHH B00701L5XS 5 1342569600 76 At first,  It wouldn't let me read the reviews so I thought it was a game. I had always been interested in tying knots, and when I opened this app, it wasn't a game, but instead (and better!), it was a step -by -step on how to tie all kinds of knots! It has BEAUTIFUL 3-D graphics, and you can rotate it 360&deg; to get a good look! this is KNOT a bad app at all!;)
A131ITL17PBJCV B0099WWKTO 4 1350259200 43 I like this game but its really expensive it makes u by a bunch of stuff then it forces u to buy more stuff to go on these quest so u can get money its kinds stupid but the dragons r really cute
A131ITL17PBJCV B00CEKIGGO 5 1373328000 20 this game is awesome!!! its really fun its not to slow and its not to fast I really like it
A131ITL17PBJCV B008B88LEU 4 1353024000 20 I like it but its not my fav I'm still trying to figure it out id get it again though
A131J11W67WQ78 B007F2EGFQ 5 1358640000 42 This ish a very great game but Zen after a couple lvls den it gets funky my roses won't grow and data fairy houses keep on breaking but otherwise it great great great greatand needing repairs same with da library it's weird
A131L6KIUSTQ0L B00FAX6XQC 5 1385251200 36 Best hunting game for kindle fire the graphics are amazing but the only problem I had was the movement controls and on how much the upgrades for the guns cost. Other than that it is amazing!
A131L6KIUSTQ0L B007P8BMTS 5 1396828800 62 I have been waiting for an app like this for a while now if I miss an episode of any CW show the app has it all I have to do is go on to the app and it will have the most recent episode so you can watch your favourite show its a app that is well worth your time .
A131L6KIUSTQ0L B00GINENG0 5 1393718400 27 I enjoy playing it and recommend it to any one. It does give the option however to download talking Angela DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE TALKING ANGELA APP.
A131L6KIUSTQ0L B00BHHIWQO 5 1378857600 29 Awsome. Cant stop playing. I love playing this game. You just keep going in order to do better. If you want fast pace fun?? This is your game then.
A131Q0ZA3LYHW8 B004JJUY4K 5 1337644800 21 Very easy to use and has great search capabilities and price alerts. Have found the cheapest airline prices using this app.
A131RAR8JJ0BJZ B008245WE0 1 1344643200 40 as soon as i downloaded it it force closed on me i personally hate the sound of rain but my mom loves it so i got it for her guss i keep searching for a new gift good try though
A131RAR8JJ0BJZ B007L3M1W4 4 1336867200 29 it works i have it on my Android  tablet yes it does have glithces as all apps but has proven it self to be the best app like this
A131RAR8JJ0BJZ B006T01L30 1 1339113600 20 not.good u have like a sugar daddy hmmm no thanks get style me girl its better wayy betterSTYLE ME GIRLL!!!!
A131T9NLMRGSYT B004SRLB1I 4 1361404800 46 This is just too funny, I just wish you could do more with it.You know you can record a session and play it back.My cat keeps looking for the purring.I just might  buy the dog and cat together, think of the news show you could record.
A131T9NLMRGSYT B00DREKMPO 5 1404000000 28 ESET is great but I returned the item for which it was purchased.  I do use ESET on my my  laps tops and have for a long time.
A131VT6DCQKT2I B00C149WAM 4 1378166400 37 Great if you are on the go like me. I travel from West Virginia to Arizona twice a year. Have my music to listen to and it is right on the nose. Set it and forget it.
A131VT6DCQKT2I B00FAX6XQC 4 1389225600 34 Pretty good game. Nothing  better so far. If their is no football on and the weather is lousy, I love to hunt and being in the military for 22 years, make me a marksman.
A131YP1PH1FN14 B00A4KVFLY 5 1363564800 32 I downloaded family feud and friend to my kindle fire and it is one my favorite top three games i must play at least once a day.  it too is very addictive.
A131YP1PH1FN14 B009UWME8U 3 1370649600 24 I picked this game by accident.  I really wanted to pick four pictures with one word in common.  It ok i played it once.
A131YP1PH1FN14 B00BGAZYLI 5 1370649600 25 My husband and I solve this game several time.  It was so much fun  It get everyone involved.  I recommend his game to my friends.
A131YP1PH1FN14 B009KS4XRO 5 1363564800 25 I down loaded to my kindle fire bingo blitz and its one of the top three games i must pay everyday..  It fun and addictive.
A131YP1PH1FN14 B00A757EFW 4 1363564800 39 It hard to use my finger  I have a pin for my kindle fire but it hard to make the man move in the direction I want him to move in.  This game for me is definitely a challenge.
A131YQYLXRBPTE B004SJ3BCI 5 1359936000 25 Everyone in the family plays this one. We enjoy the free app. Just not sure if we want to download the full app just yet.
A131YQYLXRBPTE B0096DFBZQ 1 1359936000 21 The controls are very hard to use and they did not always work as they should. The reaction time was off.
A131Z39T6X98L6 B00GGQLZUG 5 1384732800 31 Like this game a lot better than some of the others I have downloaded.  It gives you more plays and a bigger variety to do so.I would recommend this game highly.
A131Z39T6X98L6 B008R5RGAC 5 1386115200 27 I have Norton Security on 3 other computers and find it very reliable.  I am thankful to have been able to get it on Kindle for protection.
A131Z39T6X98L6 B00EC5ZFL8 5 1398988800 62 I like this slot game but the credits do not build up fast enough to continue on for awhile.  I can not afford to buy credits so it takes me a while to build up enough to play.It is quite enjoyable and i do not like to go to facebook on my Kindle Fire,therefore I do not send or get gifts.Good Game.
A131Z6RO36UA8F B009LNHMLC 4 1376092800 36 Even tho the puzzles arent very hard and theres not a ton of them, i really enjoy this app. I can come and go as i want and dont feel compelled to do the game constantly.
A131Z6RO36UA8F B009OYOASG 4 1351296000 35 fun game. enjoy playing it with my son.  wish there were few more recipes that were less then half hour cook time but we figure out the times pretty good and have fun decorating :)
A131Z6RO36UA8F B005KC664W 4 1333584000 36 this is a good game. you can turn the game help on and off and really using that help has taught me more about the game. i play it a lot when my son is sleeping
A1320Y027T3VTK B00IZ60WJA 4 1401494400 21 This app is worth $. 99. Lots to chose from. Cartoons, western sSifi, tv shows and more. Should never be bored.
A1320Y027T3VTK B004ANMWPY 5 1401494400 52 I like this app and find it handy  to see what's on in present time.And you can change settings to where ever you happen to be.If you are interested in a show and want to read about all you haveTo do is click on it to get information about your chosen show.
A1320Y027T3VTK B0093QQAEM 5 1392076800 32 This is a great app for people who like older shows or are sick of the reality shows on everywhere.  Something for everyone.. picture quality is  good. Entertainment for the whole family.
A1321DW782UQUZ B00AP9U8SA 5 1361923200 36 This app is super fun IF you buy the full version I highly recommend it if your willing to buy it if your you should probably find another app but they are very fun to play
A1323BB5KDHMVP B00CWGWAEE 4 1373760000 39 Good but the map system could be improved.  Also, the sensitivity of the app on my tablet could have been much better. (kindle fire.)  Aside from these two complaints, it was a good game and worth the $2.99 price.
A1323BB5KDHMVP B007ZQK1MY 5 1341878400 131 This is a wonderful game and I do recommend it to some of my friends-those who aren't on a budget. Most games don't come close to the quality we've come to expect from MUMBOJUMBO and you do get an awesome game if you chose to purchase from them.  Simply put-you get what you pay for!I did think this game was just a bit more choppy than the other two I've played from this developer.  But I still thoroughly enjoyed the game.  The graphics were superb, the story engaging, and the large variety of games cleverly intertwined in the story making this an excellent investment.  I also found I still enjoyed the game the second and third time through!  So, if you want to spend the money, you'll get a great game!
A1323BB5KDHMVP B007MFFE52 3 1348963200 130 This game is similar to Mafia Wars on facebook.  You can't really sit and play...unless you want to spend a lot of real money.  It can be fun to play the few minutes it takes.  However, the game forces you to seek out allies (other game players) to do 'missions' as the game progresses.  Also, you are able to attack others at your level of place others on the sanction list making them a target for others.The rumor that this game has been hacked by unscrupulous players may be true.  I've not seen any denials and I have seen some ingame evidence that this might be true.Finally, if you like facebook games that require one or more visits a day to be successful this may be the game for you.
A1323BB5KDHMVP B00ASKP5PW 1 1366416000 20 If this game is similar to its predecessor, it might be great. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on a Kindle Fire.
A1325TIUI55VTP B007XKEY6Q 5 1335571200 23 N O W all we need is T E M P L E RUN amd we'll be good please hurry with temple run
A1325TIUI55VTP B007TCMOY2 1 1340409600 21 no it is impossible to beat lvl 8 how does that prove smartnes or dumbness but i guess dont like it
A132AHCK9U8HDS B00CSR2J9I 5 1377648000 88 This is a fun game to ease boredom and also for completion with others.  My family all has it downloaded and we are constantly comparing where we are to each other.  There are several vehicles to buy once you start gathering coins and then different levels.  Buy the moon as soon as you can.  That is where you will get the most money.  I am continually trying to beat my old scores. Only bad thing is, if you get a new phone, you have to start all over.
A132BFJZSX8XTP B008Z666Q8 5 1352332800 24 I love skylanders shooting game when are you comming out with the skylanders giants but my fav skylanders giant is pop fizz and chill
A132BFJZSX8XTP B008N1V11U 5 1353801600 29 i like the game but i always get caught by bane i wonder if i can play catwomen but i still can't belive i got it for 7 dollars
A132BFJZSX8XTP B00H25P2JA 5 1390003200 42 The game is better than number two in this one you this game you can design your boss and weapons and the weapons are so much better than the other ones and you will love beating up your boss from now on
A132ETQPMHQ585 B007RZF3YE 1 1398124800 181 If you use this game on Kindle and your Kindle breaks you will LOSE everything. Hours of time money spent on coins, gems etc...it is NOT Transferable. You cannot log into another device. Just Kindle is like this the rest transfer which is what I used it's Heat-breaking to have over 100 neighbors be over 50 on levels and you LOSE it all. This is a fact 100% Fact! They could if they wanted to it's on the Kindle but they do Not do it. There are ZERO ways to recoup your hours of work money spent all  your contacts. Yes you can have a warranty and you will get a new Kindle. But... all of the Storm8 games you Lose everything! I played 7 games it's sickening and I lost hundreds of dollars as well expanding etc. You have to start a ground Zero with Kindle and this game.I play all the story games.This is good but not great. I prefer games that progress faster. The expansions go up in price to the point they are 80K which takes forever.
A132ETQPMHQ585 B005ZFOOE8 5 1396396800 25 My husband has this on his kindle works great. It's free and I must keep typing because it is required and a very silly rule.

A132ETQPMHQ585 B00B5DLSMU 5 1365724800 20 Great free game...Ruzzle FreeMAG Interactive....my daughter loves this an it is a free game you cannot beat that at all.
A132ETQPMHQ585 B006OCM0G0 1 1398470400 191 If you use this game on Kindle and your Kindle breaks you will LOSE everything. Hours of time money spent on coins, gems etc...it is NOT Transferable. You cannot log into another device. Just Kindle is like this the rest transfer which is what I used it's Heat-breaking to have over 100 neighbors be over 50 on levels and you LOSE it all. This is a fact 100% Fact! They could if they wanted to it's on the Kindle but they do Not do it. There are ZERO ways to recoup your hours of work money spent all  your contacts. Yes you can have a warranty and you will get a new Kindle. But... all of the Storm8 games you Lose everything! I played 7 games it's sickening and I lost hundreds of dollars as well expanding etc. You have to start a ground Zero with Kindle and this game.A bit outdated slower progression with slower return for food items and levels. Bakery story goes much faster a is more fun in my opinion. I prefer to get more coins for the food I prepare. I play all the  story games.

A132FWSASHK1BX B006PHD0RW 5 1348531200 20 this game is super fun. I play it almost every day and now they even have multiplayer!!! this game rocks
A132FWSASHK1BX B007MPAVS2 5 1342569600 27 this game is very,very,VERY, addictive. it doesn't really have a point which is probably why it's SO ADDICTIVE I would reccemend this game to very organized kids.
A132FWSASHK1BX B0064X7B4A 5 1365379200 24 this is a great game to play with friends everywhere!!!! you can do it whenever you want! I love this game.... plus, its free

A132FWSASHK1BX B008J1ZVRY 1 1341878400 45 it is totally copying the original temple run!!!!!!!!! you cant even buy more people like her brothers or her dad. you cant even buy any power ups. she is slow and cant barely jump over a stick. I would not recomend this game to ANYONE!!!!
A132FWSASHK1BX B00E78QIDE 5 1375401600 26 riddle me that is a really fun game. it is not like any other take because this one is challenging. I would recommend this to anybody.
A132FWSASHK1BX B0086700CM 5 1338249600 42 finally, I have been waiting forever for this game, it just came out and already has 1500 bought. that proves its fantastic if you didn't like this fame you would either have never played it or you would have to be insane
A132FWSASHK1BX B008CG839O 5 1341532800 47 when I first played it, it froze my kindle so I turned it off then it wouldn't turn back on. I held the power button for 20 seconds waited then pressed it one more time. after it turned on it never froze again.  it was super fun!!!!!!!!!!
A132FWSASHK1BX B0073V0FC2 5 1336089600 21 this game is amazing, you get to go to different worlds the farther you get. this game rocks!!!!! I love it!!
A132FWSASHK1BX B0054JZC6E 5 1349827200 25 I think this game is really cool works great for kindle fire not sure for anything else so its a fun challenging game the end.

A132FWSASHK1BX B00689PMD2 1 1336089600 40 if you have a kindle fire do not buy this app!!! it shuts down you entire kindle then deletes all your apps!!! then it wont allow you to buy anything or watch anything. it also isn't appropriate for little kids.
A132GRVDGXPJGY B00AUXZJAS 5 1391644800 31 This is a lot of fun but challenging at the same time. I play Lumosity on the computer to exercise my brain.  This app lets me do it on the go.
A132GRVDGXPJGY B0074AKEDC 2 1339027200 26 I didn't get to far. The graphics were just too lame for me to continue. I am uninstalling this app immediately even though it was free
A132GRVDGXPJGY B007N5YIUS 3 1332892800 20 awful!  the developers phoned this one in.  it's ridiculously easy.took about 20 minutes to get three stars in every level.
A132GRVDGXPJGY B004RJ6978 2 1321747200 52 The UI needs major improvements.  To many steps to create a list such as inventory.  Main screen says to click menu for info. on how to use.  only problem is, there is no menu button displayed (Motorola Xoom).  Would never pay for this and i'm uninstalling even though it was the FAOTD.
A132H66QDUL54L B00ET0PZDO 1 1390348800 35 Simple put waste of time and effort on this app.Don't waste your time.  Sorry app waste of time. Don't bother I can not over state because they want to many words to give a rating.
A132H66QDUL54L B00FAPF5U0 5 1388275200 23 Great addicking game,How many levels can you go.Entertainment for hours a must for the price. Its a steal Get it youll love it!
A132H66QDUL54L B009KEN87O 5 1388275200 26 Reminds me of ATRIA space invaders. Makes time fly while waiting in long line for tickets to a show or the doctors office ect... Good challenge
A132H66QDUL54L B00GSZEBE2 4 1387584000 29 Still learning game.But so far it seems like it is going to be a fun and entertaing game. For the prime price and down load you cant beat it!
A132H66QDUL54L B00AE6SS5O 5 1387584000 23 Will keep you entrtained for hours that seem like seconds.Couldnt beleave how time flew.Seek differences in pictures. puzzles in maps and many more.
A132H66QDUL54L B007SN9TKE 5 1387584000 27 Great book. You type in spices,vetggies,meat,ect... hit enter and gives you multipy recipes you can make with what you have.Some you would ever think of great app.
A132H66QDUL54L B00COQTZLS 5 1387584000 25 Just got it. What I have browsed on what you can do with it.Make appointments,calender, keep notes, reminders. I think it will be app tool.
A132H66QDUL54L B00EEDJHXA 3 1388275200 41 This game is ok . Still havent played with it much.Just got kindle and there is so much to do with a kindle.I am sure once I get engrossed in how it works  I will have to come back and edit.
A132H66QDUL54L B00G118LYY 1 1388275200 27 For a child 4 to 7yrs I would say it would be a 5 star.But for older kids I think it wouldnt hold there attention very long.
A132J252OTJF97 B004SJ3204 3 1359244800 25 seams inpossible to win the computer almost alway has a better hand. Other than that it was ok will keep looking for a different app
A132J252OTJF97 B0064X7FVE 4 1374883200 23 Really like this app, easy to use and understand. Used it so we knew what we would need to pack for a trip.
A132J252OTJF97 B009KS4XRO 5 1369180800 20 Try to play everyday. All my kids play too. Easy and free. Some changes to collecting. Each level is different
A132JW9ED1DQBM B005LVLJP8 1 1357084800 82 Spades Free is a wasted program. Shortly after downloading it, I used it, and even shorter after that, I deleted it. It is a very heavy program that allows you to copy and download videos from youtube, and once downloaded, starts sending you constant spam from their contributors. I deleted the program because of how inconvenient it was to use and had to block the flood of email traffic that shortly ensued. I would caution anyone from downloading this app to use.
A132JW9ED1DQBM B004SZHD3K 1 1357084800 64 Slots Royale is a wasted program. Shortly after downloading it, I played it, and even shorter after that, I deleted it.

A132L0QWXE6B1 B004SBS8LA 5 1388534400 25 I had the old version with the ads, and they were annoying to say the least. this is a great update without ads. thanks Amazon.com!
A132L0QWXE6B1 B005LIYX5Y 5 1345766400 22 It is better than what I thought it would be! Playing is addictive. Works great on my Android phone. Very fun game!
A132L0QWXE6B1 B004GMJKTK 5 1345939200 24 love it! it works great on my Samsung phone. no problems, a very entertaining and thought out game. takes away boring waiting room time!
A132L0QWXE6B1 B004SJ3BCI 5 1346803200 52 I have played this game so many times, and I am still learning new things. I bought the "mighty Eagle", but have only used it once, when I was stumped on a hard level. I have the free version, but am seriously thinking about paying for the advertisement free one. game on!
A132L0QWXE6B1 B0086700CM 5 1345852800 33 a very addictive game for a smartphone. It works great, and plays very well on my Samsung Galaxie 2. I spend hours playing this game just to beat the different levels. Good Job!
A132L0QWXE6B1 B005HSL626 5 1346803200 58 I have wore out my finger, and two stylus's on this game. I think my screen was smoking one time. This is a very good game, with lots of action! I really enjoy playing it. but word of warning: If you play it in public, people will state at you like you are crazy! you have been warned.
A132SQUJZX4H17 B0071Q75AO 3 1330041600 22 When I bought this app, I thought it could actually read your emotions. But this app is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO strange, it's L.O.L. funny.
A132SQUJZX4H17 B004ZALKMI 5 1329523200 71 I love this app! It's so much fun! If I touch the screen with my finger, the hairy ball follows it. I think that anyone who needs a dose of laughter every day NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDSSS this app. It made me L.O.L.(Laugh Out Loud). I'll DEFINENTLY use this on a day where I am feeling :-(( (very sad) or :-( (sad). In the words of Zack Ryder ,&quot;WOO, WOO, WOO! You know it!&quot;
A132SQUJZX4H17 B00689PMD2 5 1326585600 22 If you feel that nobody understands you and that you want to live in your own little world, BUY THIS APP NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A132SQUJZX4H17 B004SJ3BCI 5 1327104000 40 My dad and I love this game. Sometimes when we're watching TV, I'll play Angry Birds, or another game, on my kindle fire. But one time, when I was watching TV, HE was playing Angry Birds on my kindle fire.
A132TIQ84W163A B008Y2FRFO 4 1348876800 21 its a fun game. a really great way to kill time. only suggestion is having a higher limit than 45 coins.
A132TIQ84W163A B00E0TK5G6 5 1378080000 32 By far, this is the best HOG ever! The storyline, puzzles, everything will keep you hooked. Just skip the free trial, and go to the $1.99 immediately. You will not be disappointed.
A132TIQ84W163A B00DBER974 5 1376784000 53 This, just like all the other releases from BFG, was entertaining. The story kept moving, and for $1.99, I definitely feel it was worth he money. There were moments where I had to tap a few times in one spot to utilize what was needed, but other than that, it was smooth sailing.
A132U9UOLX192C B006UJMHD8 2 1372204800 33 The name say it all, when you try to outdo moron test one you would either get it right but this is completely wrong but maybe this is they were trying to accomplish
A132U9UOLX192C B005CKNPAK 3 1372204800 46 She is eight and finished the whole thing in about an hour or so.....If you paying money for it don't waste you money, if it is free through a promo maybe but the excitement wore off quickly and I don't think it has been played again.
A132U9UOLX192C B00AM1RL4A 5 1372204800 28 My daughter loves playing this game.  It is wholesome and fun for the entire family, we can compete against each other and friend what a good past time.
A132ZLX99BM5LB B0070Z89CY 5 1336521600 33 I thouroughly enjoy this game from the amazon app store! its simple and easy but also a good amount of fun. graphics are basic, nothing too fancy, but all-in-all a pretty great app.
A132ZLX99BM5LB B0078SLMEU 4 1330214400 32 not a bad app at all. lots of cool choices. would've given this rating a perfect score except there were not enough categories to choose from. but overall not too bad!! :-)
A132ZLX99BM5LB B008Y2FRFO 5 1348099200 28 this reminds me of gambling on the norweigian pearl cruise, except 100x better because I'm not losing real money!!!! everyone- give this a try! you wont regret it.
A132ZLX99BM5LB B0067Q42BY 5 1329955200 23 enjoyable mahjong game! great graphics, simple play instructions. very addicting!! I reccomend everyone try this awesome app! nothing bad to say about it.
A132ZLX99BM5LB B007ET5P4Q 4 1331856000 39 I really love the show 'The Walking Dead', and this app was a huge surprise to me. I loved playing it, and would've given it a perfect score except I felt it was too short. But great stuff nonetheless!
A132ZLX99BM5LB B0073LWEXK 5 1328486400 30 I looooove this game. really is a lot of fun to figure out. scenery is also quite beautiful. kudos to Fire Maple Games. looking forward to future games from them.
A132ZLX99BM5LB B007XKEY6Q 5 1335398400 34 I love this game so much!! very funny and easy to understand. everyone should give this a try! I guarantee you will find it fun! play against friends or random people. good stuff! :-)
A132ZLX99BM5LB B0094FYBB6 5 1353888000 26 I really enjoy playing this game, and like the little incentives it has to give me goals, etc. Lots of fun to play, check it out!
A132ZLX99BM5LB B007JPG04E 5 1332028800 36 I really enjoy this shooting game. I like the simplicity of it and the easy instructions. not a game for children but suitable for teens and older in my opinion. sort of cheesy but good reguardless.
A132ZLX99BM5LB B0052AZJV8 4 1327363200 36 very easy to use. simple and organized. can add multiple screen names from different servers. this is a must-have for anyone who doesn't like the hassle of having to sign in Online just to IM friends!
A132ZLX99BM5LB B009ZS2B28 5 1358812800 41 just wanted to quickly say that this game is pretty addicting, and I cant get enough! if you enjoy the traditional bingo game, but want a bit more of a challenge- then here ya go! also, kudos to the creators! :-)
A132ZLX99BM5LB B008K6G8CK 5 1348617600 29 my favvvvvvvvvvvorite game is this bingo, hands down. absolutely a top 5 contender. try this game !!!!!! it is super fun and addictive, perfect for me. plus its free!
A132ZLX99BM5LB B008JJS6D2 4 1346889600 58 I actually really like this game. it is simple and keeps me busy when I am bored. the only suggestion I would make is to have maybe different speeds for when the number balls are put up. like have a easy speed, medium, hard, etc. all in all a really nice game. give it a try! it's free!
A1330ZB498IOH6 B008JK6W5K 4 1361664000 30 Great way to pass idle time. Really makes you wonder as to howmany logos we can recognize yet not know the name. Frustrating yet entertaining. Albeit for a short while.
A1330ZB498IOH6 B007TNQ7EY 4 1370304000 84 If you like the GTA(grand theft auto) series then you`ll love this game! The graphics are similar to early ps1 games. Very blocky and the game controls can be a bit clumsy but overall fast paced gameplay &amp; interesting story line. Keeps you entertained for a short while since the game gets a bit repetitive,but I`m sure once the game evolves more then the map &amp; storyline will expand. Great price too but I`m sure it will be on sale in the near future.
A1330ZB498IOH6 B00DFW3818 4 1380326400 22 The song choices keep you on your toes. Great way to pass the time or play with company as an ice breaker.
A1330ZB498IOH6 B007BTE2F2 1 1362873600 27 You`d be better off googling body parts. The app freezes every two seconds and doesnt allow you to zoom in and the button interface is garbage. next!
A1330ZB498IOH6 B00AM1EPB2 5 1356480000 84 The game is absolutely amazing. The graphics are decent given the fact that it is an app. The gameplay/storyline intriguing. The level/buying process is fairly decent and doesn't take too much time. You get enough without having to actual bust your wallet. The button interface is a bit sluggish, but it keeps up enough to keep along with the fast paced gameplay. Bit of terror here and there and the objectives are not to intricate but keep you busy. I recommend this to anyone!
A1330ZB498IOH6 B00A3NQNUU 4 1355788800 51 I must admit I was skeptical at first, but when I began to play I fell in love. The game functions are easy to master, the visuals are cute and the gameplay engaging. Once you start I`m sure you won`t want to stop. easy to advance in the game as well.
A1330ZB498IOH6 B00BBMQXLG 4 1362873600 83 If you love a fast paced game that requires quick thinking and strategy then this is the game for you. The graphics are superb, the purchasing options are decent enough to not break your wallet (but not necessary to progress in the game), the flow of the story line intriguing, yet the monsters could have a bit more variety. I feel as if I battle the same monster over and over. Overall wonderful game that will keep you playing for hours to come.
A1330ZB498IOH6 B007RZF3YE 4 1356393600 118 I am completely obsessed with this product. I started off very hesitant because you have to pay, but I realized you don' t have to pay a dime to play this game. Once you've accumulated several friends it gets the ball rolling. Earning gold to purchase new items is fairly easy and quick. Just the waiting gets a bit tedious, but chatting with friends makes it go by quick. The effects and visuals are surprisingly well done. The interface needs a few tweeks, but overall very easyto navigate. I recommend it for anyone who likes a game similar game to Simcity. I just wish the storyline and quest were better and a bit more hands on and challenging.
A1330ZB498IOH6 B009PSV1HE 4 1354752000 21 interface glides effortlessly, game is fast paced and keeps you entertained. i recommended it if you like time based strategy games
A1330ZB498IOH6 B00876UUN6 3 1360454400 26 If you`re interested in Pokemon and have patience then this is a game for you. Easy controls, gameplay fast and inviting. Graphics are humorous and pleasing.
A1332FUV6CGBDV B009S98W3Q 5 1352764800 28 The game graphics are awesome. I never get bored playing! The levels are challenging enough, just right. If you like shooting and explosions, this game us for you!
A1332FUV6CGBDV B00CC59H8W 5 1367193600 35 I really enjoyed playing this game. At first I thought it was for kids but quickly found adults can enjoy this game just as much! Works great on my Kindle Fire! WELL worth downloading. Addicting!
A13334RXER76P6 B00CWY76CC 3 1377820800 26 I already gave this a review, but when is the next update to unlock rooms 10-?? says it commin soon but when?! any1 have an idea?
A13334RXER76P6 B005KC664W 5 1349568000 23 Great way to kill time while laid up in the hospital or recovering from surgery like am lil..I love it and it's addictive!!
A13334RXER76P6 B006QMNQ6Q 4 1374537600 56 PRO: this game is making me brush up my vocabulary lol and even havin me scratch my head in confusion. I also find myself wakin up at night imputing in a word or two along with rackin my brains on the biggin..CON: some words (to me) don't make sense and you lose all your points :(
A13334RXER76P6 B00D1A1F50 3 1383523200 29 it really motivates your brain into thinking. but for me, I ain't. much of a riddle person so l'll have this app as long as I don't. go gray.
A13334RXER76P6 B00FX6ZBXC 5 1384905600 22 I'm to chicken to play against real people..so I play with the chums and it also helps me get sleepy Lol....gn *yawn*
A13334RXER76P6 B00DUGCLY4 3 1376870400 35 the game was just ok..but was shocked to have finished the game in such a short time give or take 20min. some of the pics, however, were a little kiddish and some didn't make sense.
A13334RXER76P6 B0091SUMB4 3 1351382400 32 still not sure whet to think of it so far..gave it a 3 star for now till I can see exactly if its working will edit comment in the next few weeks..
A13334RXER76P6 B00AA87JGU 4 1377475200 29 so far so good..daughter played b4 I did so I started over from the beginning. but I'm sure..sooner or later ill get a headache from using ma brainless brain...
A13334RXER76P6 B00AV8YANY 4 1378857600 31 I love word searchers that have the twisties mostly. Then I found this game. Its an alternitive for now, and I play it mainly at night for when I can't sleep.
A1333MEXX4B2DL B0055SWM08 5 1334016000 22 this is the best free app of the day ever I have never seen a more fun game!!! over all sweet game.
A1334ZG6V54W8P B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392076800 29 This game is amazing I love it so much.it is so hard it's fun. I love it. Me and my friends play it every day. It's so addicting .
A1334ZG6V54W8P B006OBWGHO 5 1346803200 42 this game is ssoooooooooooooooooooooo fun I love it I passed all the levels but once u do pass all the levels then u start to stop playing oh well love it sooooooooooooooooooooo freaking much love to play every once and a while
A1334ZG6V54W8P B009UX2YAC 5 1356739200 72 this game is very fun. it is soooooo addicting very fun love how you have to earn your money once I got my kindle I looked to see if they had made this game they did not so I looked a month or two later and it wad there I was so so so so happy now I am addicted to this game it is so so so so fun like totally!!!
A1334ZG6V54W8P B00BG3ID0Y 1 1365638400 20 This game sucks and it won't even turn on.I'm not going to get any more games like this ever again.
A13361T0V5FWFH B007PT3QOQ 1 1402790400 72 downloaded it a couple of weeks ago and it was fun...but for the past 4 days it crashes when I try to play.  K was able to get in for 10 seconds of play only to see that my crops have withered and one of the kids died.  I have uninstalled this game.  Seriously Gameloft... before you go paying for this ad to pop up on other games you should fix this.
A13361T0V5FWFH B00G357N92 4 1394409600 23 This game is so much fun.  They give you a lot of levels for free.  I have actually considered buying the whole game.
A13361T0V5FWFH B00BW08XRO 4 1392681600 24 This game is fun.  I play both 1 and 2...just wish I could get a little further without having to actually purchase the game.
A1336VE70EWH0R B004SH9JSU 5 1361923200 28 Lots of fun, play with friends or make new ones...just deal the cards...lol. The price is definitely right...Free to buy...Free to play.  That's right in my price range!
A1339I2PQQ6C43 B004EBZX6W 1 1325203200 45 I downloaded this app expecting to keep my kindle up to date on wifi, but ended up with a frozen wiring connection and a hopeless situation. thanks to the amazon help team, my kindle was saved. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. THIS APP IS USLESS AND DESTRUCTIVE!!!
A1339I2PQQ6C43 B006OC2ANS 5 1330300800 26 I'mgetging free credits for this so... yeah. its a fun game. you willl like it. Buy it. I mean, its free,, so theirs nothing to lose.
A1339I2PQQ6C43 B00A8ECU24 4 1354665600 20 YES YES THANKYOU SO MUCH PONY PONY FUN TIME VROOM HAPPY CRY DONKEY WHOOP WHOOP VICTORY FOR ALLL US PONIES
A1339I2PQQ6C43 B008G0HTUU 5 1341273600 27 its a good, fun way to waste time at work or during a rainy day. plenty of upgrades and different modes keep the formula from becoming stale.
A1339I2PQQ6C43 B00BGC5UAG 5 1362787200 27 good go go g g g g yes go. it good j j j j j j j j z as sd e a s. e d
A1339I2PQQ6C43 B006ON41FC 5 1329436800 37 I love this game!! Its a great time waster. Connecting to openfient has no effect whatsoever. I didn't even realize that I had connected untill reading the reviews. Honestly, if it bothers you that much, go offline.
A1339Y3632D9O2 B008JGSM6G 5 1345248000 20 this app is very addictive! I just downloaded it about an hour ago and I just can't stop playing it!
A1339Y3632D9O2 B004ZFK600 1 1344816000 25 The number you are supplied with is only a trial number, then you have to pay to have another number. i don't recommend this app.
A1339Y3632D9O2 B008K6HN8I 1 1353974400 20 I have a Kindle Fire and I followed all recommended steps to get it to print, and it wouldn't work.
A133DE0MU7NO60 B004GVYXTS 5 1328227200 23 great...loved playingthis game is easy to play and the word choices are pretty cool. wish it could be played in horizontal mode.  enjoy!!!
A133DE0MU7NO60 B00I0WIUHK 5 1391299200 21 The graphics are wonderful on this game.  The second chance feature is nice, too. I would recommend it for all ages.
A133DE0MU7NO60 B00FOW265Q 4 1383868800 31 This is a great game to pass the time.  The only complaint I have is that the letters are not bright enough and that's why I didn't give it five stars.
A133FT4JIJJ4AZ B00B2V66VS 5 1363651200 25 This game keeps me guessing, never giving me the same course twice. Just when you think you've conquered it, it kicks it up another notch.
A133FT4JIJJ4AZ B00BXPQN2K 5 1389484800 29 A cute little world builder. Not a ton of ads either, which is nice. It could be a bit faster paced, but other than that, it works just fine.
A133FT4JIJJ4AZ B009YOX9C4 2 1363219200 56 While the app looks great, it can't handle a huge library. I have roughly 3,000 books, and the app kept crashing. When I did finally get all of my books added to the app, I was then unable to access them, it just couldn't handle the load. Nice try, maybe the next version will work better...
A133FXP14UQSZW B008YW5RH2 1 1390521600 29 The screen never flips the right way. Every time I try to rotate the kindle, it flips the wrong way. Unfortunate because I was looking forward to playing this.
A133FXP14UQSZW B00ET0PZDO 3 1389312000 41 It was slightly difficult once I got up to level 15 but only a bit more after that. I would recommend this game to people who have a hard time with the others out there. Good fun for free. Not bad
A133FXP14UQSZW B00FRM93FE 4 1389744000 40 Absolutely fun game. Wasn't too difficult, because some of these point and click games are ridiculous. Overall 4 stars because while I say it wasn't difficult, it was almost too easy. Still fun, great environment for these types of games.
A133H4X2J70AAF B007MNV5WU 1 1339286400 22 I think they should lower the price. What I dont understand why google play could get for free so why cant we?
A133H4X2J70AAF B0086700CM 5 1340841600 21 this app is one of the best apps on the amazon app store. Its awesome. You should really get this app.
A133IE7N9YTBJ0 B00ET0PZDO 3 1389484800 63 Enjoyed the game until I became stuck at level 8. Have tapped things till I think I will break my device but can't find solution.  Can't find a way to move on without solving.  So tried to delete app completely and it continues to pop up on my home screen.  May need to be more tech savvy than I to use this game.
A133IE7N9YTBJ0 B00AKJRPC2 5 1403308800 179 This was a really enjoyable point and click mystery game. It would be a great one for someone just trying out this style of game, as it is challenging, but has enough hints and help available to ensure you will not get frustrated. And since it is not as outrageously priced as some, you can afford to take a chance.There were several hidden object games, which I found well done and an enjoyable break in the action.  They were challenging without relying too much on darkness or small size to &#34;hide&#34; the items as many games do. Many of the found objects are used to further the game.The story was interesting without overpowering the action with narration. I can't speak to narration, as I play with the sound off while watching tv in the evening.  But the progression made sense and kept me wanting to play &#34;just a little longer&#34;.  Which was fine, since it was a good length.  There is also a bonus game at the end, which includes some complex puzzles.Hope to find more games like this!
A133IE7N9YTBJ0 B00JJNT3MK 5 1398902400 152 In this genre you travel through a story collecting hints and objects to further your quest. As you travel through the story there are unique mini-games and hidden objects. I find the hidden object pages fun, and a nice break in the game.  And thank you, Alawar, for adding the ability to click to the map page to move between scenes.  The back and forth arrows in some of the other games became tedious.  This is a great pass time while relaxing or watching tv.  It takes some thought, but not so challenging that you give up, and there are great hints.  I also appreciate that Alawar gives the price up front, unlike Big Fish games. I hate starting a &#34;free&#34; sample only to find the full game is $4.99, or equally overpriced when you are half way through.My only complaint is that I don't understand all the permissions on this app.
A133IP47J8FUPF B00BR5759Q 1 1365206400 55 I don't really like this game.  I love collapse and tetris and bejeweled and I am finding it very hard to find a good enough version of those games.  None of the apps coming out are the same. I can't even find tetris anywhere, except for something even worse than this one chance only version.
A133IP47J8FUPF B0064TVQ5E 4 1357689600 22 This game is something fun and new. I like it, and will be able to play it for a while to come.
A133IP47J8FUPF B006OBWGHO 5 1372291200 39 This game is really fun to play and never gets boring. Some levels are really hard and that is cool. It's better to have a good range of levels. O haven't needed our wanted to buy anything yet either.
A133IP47J8FUPF B0063GORYU 5 1365379200 41 I love spider solitaire and all the other solitaires too!!! They can keep you occupied for hours or days. Ha ha. I have, too. I love the fact that these games are now electronic and will never grow tired of them.
A133IP47J8FUPF B009HKL4B8 5 1362355200 23 I love Sims and this version is great!!! So far there's plenty to do, and I love the creativity allowed with multiple characters.
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B007693VXG 1 1361145600 22 Boring game. It's hard to pop the pimples, and it gets pretty boring. Also pretty stupid, don't wast your time with it.
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B008DGDK64 5 1359763200 32 This is a pretty cool app, I must admit. I like it, and I'm a girl! My good friend has it,  so I downloaded it, and I'm glad I did. Sweet app!
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B008RKNG88 1 1351728000 30 The grapgics are bad and the game is really lame. Don't. be like me and just skip comments and get it!! It's. horrible! Not to mention a waste of memory!
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B0086700CM 5 1350432000 27 When I saw this game on the appstore, my brother told me to buy it. I thought it would be stupid,  but it's really fun. Love it!
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B0067VKQLE 5 1358380800 23 Such a fun game! Totally worth the money. Buy it, you won't be sorry! Who knew that killing Zombies could be so addicting!
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B0069G5Z9K 5 1358294400 48 I love this game! It's kind of like &quot;Temple Run&quot; in a way, because you keep running (or jetpacking) to get coins and stuff. A guy I know reccomended it to me and a bunch of my friends and two brothers got the game. super cool and addicting!
A133L5M2LB2AQJ B007MTKYQC 5 1354579200 26 I love this game and I really want to get the full version. I find myself playing levels over and over again. I love this game.
A133OKCDH3NEYT B00599ZRSC 5 1312848000 40 the dl is long but I love this game. no fc or crashes in my G2X I play everyday. just sucks you will eventually have turn &quot;buy &quot; credits to get better stuff but so far I&apos;m good without it.
A133OKCDH3NEYT B00G9B1MEM 1 1396656000 32 Would not install. I tried multiple times to get the app to install.  It constantly kept giving me the same error.  So since I couldn't enjoy the game my rating is low.
A133OKCDH3NEYT B004SJ3BCI 5 1318982400 25 this is the best way to kill time. angry birds have taken over and I am on with it. I play it all the time.
A133OKCDH3NEYT B004QJGPNM 1 1301961600 26 doesn't work with my phone so trying to uninstall i have the mytouch 3g 2 . 2 so no reason not to work : - (
A133PYML1O4E5F B00BFUUMO8 5 1364688000 27 this game is amazing addicting and extremely accurate to the movie saga that has been such a big hit and now the game is a hit too
A133PYML1O4E5F B00881VLCE 5 1370908800 38 this game is a great way to do puzzles without it even taking room in your kitchen or family.room. and every time you exit the game you can open it back up to where you were exactly at.
A133PYML1O4E5F B008JK6W5K 5 1353110400 22 so time consuming on the bus and so much fun, I hope they will make a second one with even more logos
A133Q8F14W1EP0 B0088QGB7Y 5 1349827200 26 its a really fun and challenging game and who doesn't love the smurfs especially smurfette. its fun for all ages of your family and so fun
A133Q8F14W1EP0 B00DHQHQCE 5 1383264000 40 must get super fun just like clash of clans maybe even better must have game get it iove this game its awsome  please get it its  is so fun i can pley it for hours on end must have game
A133Q8F14W1EP0 B00FAX6XQC 5 1381708800 31 takes up a lot of memory i deleted tons of games but i dont want to delete every thing but i seen someone play it on ipad and it was sweet
A133R20L3BX17O B00AMR1HZ8 4 1377129600 23 I like the theory & game, but it moves a little slow.  I don't use the sound, but wish the game were faster
A133R20L3BX17O B0066T0BTO 5 1377129600 24 This is a fun challenge and moves along nicely.  Is enough of a challenge when you are tired, and watching tv at same time.,
A133R20L3BX17O B006SMLAMQ 4 1350864000 37 The third day I had this app a message came up stating: The application Weather + has stopped unexpectedly.  Please try again.  I have tried several times ( more that 5) and still get the same message.
A133SFXA7782QZ B00BPC23XO 4 1392508800 24 this game is awesome and I like that its different from the other four pics one word games and its easy but challenging too
A133SWO36EHQIB B00A3WTXQ2 5 1379376000 21 Was the 1st game I ever got, and I loved it, it is the cutest!!!!! Totally get this app for you!
A133SWO36EHQIB B00BG3ID0Y 5 1387756800 23 Such a wonderful game it is free, and you can enjoy this great puzzle game with family!!!!!!! I play it all the time!
A133SWO36EHQIB B009GXHOW4 5 1372809600 27 U can change creative back to survival and stuff. It helped me so much, I love it! Now I have diamond and gold, and big houses!!!!! :D
A133TEF2DPOCKL B00884GR0W 1 1346284800 140 I'd like to lie to you and say it's fantastic, worth every.one of the 498 pennies. But I won't. It's nothing like that. You can take spawner blocks and basically place characters. Aaron, big tough guy with a sword and shield. Spawn him. Kraden, a small little monster. Spawn it. Aaron stands around and dances in circles using the bad AI he has. The Kraden runs at you and kills you in seconds. Dragons fly through the floor. It takes Minecraft's style, and turns it to a pile of brown slop in the bottom of your shower. It's that bad. Don't waste your money. Get 5 GOOD apps that you will ENJOY. For examle, Angry Birds ad-free, Where's My Water?, Temple Run, Call Of Mini: Zombies, and The Moron Test. Buy those for your $5 instead. Heck, that's 3&cent; cheaper.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B007U7IKVM 4 1346112000 26 There is a Pistol, Revolver, Assault Rifle, Grenade,  and Shotgun. -1 star for false pictures. Game works great! I suggest using instructions for first time, though.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B006D1ONE4 5 1346284800 20 In one word? Fantastic. Fun graphics, great gameplay, great style, buy this, not that Where's My Perry junk! Very fun.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B0058VCGXU 5 1346284800 23 Of course it's not real. Kindle Fire doesn't even have a camera. It's to prank your friend, and it does that just fine.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B008J1ZVRY 1 1346284800 21 Where's My Perry, and now this. Temple Run. Brave. No connection. Brave wasn't even a good movie from what I've heard.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B004TP2E7O 5 1327449600 26 In a word: awesome. Simply so much fun, you can't stop! Robots, guns,monsters,armor, what else do you need? Final decision: it's AMAZING, isn't that great! :D
A133TEF2DPOCKL B008M2WGRI 4 1346112000 32 Great game, fun graphics, but VS is incredibly laggy, so it loses one star. Co-op isn't bad in the way of lag. It's bearable, and single player has no problems. 9/10 overall.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B0067VKQLE 5 1346198400 26 In my opinion, the only reason it's not #1 is the $3 price tag. $3 is a small price to pay for this game. Get it!
A133TEF2DPOCKL B0058VW36U 5 1346284800 21 Cute, fun game. Don't know why it needs location, but otherwise, it's great, great gameplay, awesome variety of levels, et cetera.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B005UOK2KY 1 1346284800 23 Danboe does not bees more money to run his stupid Annoying Orange show and Youtube channel. I suggest not buying. Don't help him.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B0069G5Z9K 4 1346284800 21 It's fun, my only complaint is the fact that there is absolutely zero replayability. You beat it, and you're done. Congrats.
A133TEF2DPOCKL B00992CF6W 4 1349222400 58 Sure, it's great. It crushes Block Story. Does it deserve all this credit? No! Is it worth 6.99? Yes and no. Yes if you like Minecraft, I personally love and own it on computer and Xbox 360, it's mostly worth the $30 (computer), $15 (Xbox 360), or $7 (handheld), but be sure you want it for the price.
A133VMJRHW75S7 B00634GHJA 2 1335052800 63 this works Ok.  If you really want to transfer photos from your phone to you computer then use dropbox.  you can also transfer anything else you want including video,  documents,  anything. that's on your phone.  And you can access it on any of the computers you use.  I don't work for them but am an avid user of dropbox,  simply a better choice
A133VMJRHW75S7 B0066T8M1I 5 1325116800 41 Works wonderfully on both my Samsung Galaxy S phone and Tab 10.1.  Nothing wrong with trade windows,  nothing buggy.  Looks and plays smooth,  great animation. this is a top notch version of a classic boardgame.  Bad reviews are from inept people.
A133VMJRHW75S7 B006VW94HQ 5 1343174400 23 Hey very enjoyable word game. It really is a very fun connect the word game that is terribly addicting. Totally worth the download.
A133YOQCGENSZ6 B00HRMNKWE 3 1399852800 47 The game is enjoyable and pretty addictive.  However, I was all the way to level 20 in each and every category when the game suddenly froze.  When I got back in, every level is back to 0 and I didn't really feel like starting all over :(
A133ZV2K7YFZVZ B00BG3ID0Y 5 1365984000 22 ghh fhb fb g dbftg ggss ifgxwe tyhde yijvdrg gcergv ghfethv gfgb. hcrb hfdy ggyhgf gfthvdr jc hfrt hft tthb. fghvfy hgf.
A133ZV2K7YFZVZ B007MFDUP8 5 1334620800 51 This new version is WAY better than the old version. Now you can play 15 rounds a day instead of 2. Plus only 8 people in each room out of 100 rooms. That means you can get a chance to draw faster. I recommend this game to everyone who reads this!!!!!
A133ZV2K7YFZVZ B00846GKTW 5 1338249600 23 This game is really fun and amusing. Im kind of addicted to it. :) I recommend this game to girls of all ages.
A133ZV2K7YFZVZ B006D1ONE4 5 1326931200 21 This game is so much fun! I couldn't put it down. It's so addicting. It's worth buying. I love this game!!!
A13419SLGGAS2I B00HTYNMWS 4 1394668800 21 I would recommend this game. Good mind workout for seniors especially. A person can loose track of time playing this game.
A134B3W4VFA2O9 B0054JZC6E 4 1333238400 24 It is very fun. If you are looking for something to do this is your game. Tons of minigames to spend some time playing
A134B3W4VFA2O9 B0069G5Z9K 5 1345680000 44 I play this game on my Kindle Fire a lot. I don't know what those other people are talking about when the say it ruins your kindle, because it works great on mine. I love this app so much. It is also really easy.
A134B3W4VFA2O9 B009PSV1HE 5 1352592000 27 I really love this game. The game is about owning a dinner place and making the costumers happy. It works good on the kindle. It is fun.

A134IQH0P819OA B00HY9UK28 5 1392422400 33 Great app uses a variety of music some I don't know but it's fun when u r bored my friend and I luv to play this on our free time on the buss
A134IQH0P819OA B0087TQYUG 5 1370390400 22 Awesomeness in a bundle of learning. How do you learn?you play and you Don't know that you are learning.Awesomeness!!!!! Kindle lover &pound;&lt;&euro;&yen;&raquo;
A134IXJELKIJ2Z B00BX42FLY 4 1399939200 22 I like the game. I'm writing the review so the pop up stops asking me to though. Other than that, it's good.
A134IXJELKIJ2Z B00EEDJHXA 5 1387584000 39 This game is so great and I can't stop playing. I especially love that it doesn't keep asking me to rate it, invite friends to play, etc. This is the best game I've downloaded in a very long time.
A134MIH22XUSU6 B0054JZC6E 5 1328054400 22 I like this. game well it st least gives me a willing ti keep playing it constantly so I would like t
A134MIH22XUSU6 B0067Q4RCI 5 1328140800 23 this game is what I have played the best funny game since I got it. Everytime I play it with my best exciting.
A134MIH22XUSU6 B007TNS6JI 4 1336089600 27 it is a very great game.  I give four stars just because kindle fire edition doesnot have the multiply ggame. thus I cannot play with my friends.
A134MIH22XUSU6 B004DLNC4I 5 1328313600 28 well j just install and do not open it.but I wanna create. the comment before openning it. yeah it must be a good app when I was sleeping.
A134MIH22XUSU6 B0055SWM08 5 1334016000 42 I was looking foe this kind of game for long time.because I played this type of game when I was child. I till reneged hoe interesting that game was and there were four base element which were fire water dirt and ice.
A134MQCA1C5PX0 B0067Q42BY 5 1330300800 23 I am happy to not have paid for this app, but it is a great looking game.  Glad I got it for free.
A134MQCA1C5PX0 B0052UZIFA 2 1332460800 32 Unfortunately I can't play it on my Archos 101it.  I used to play on my LG Optimus (which NOTHING is compatible with) but heaven help anyone with a less than $500.00 tablet.
A134N15U58YLEG B005ZXWMUS 5 1335484800 25 the only bad thing is you have to pay for netflix but that regular don't know why people are giving it less than 5 stars
A134N15U58YLEG B00599ZRSC 2 1330041600 26 this game is ok but it sucks because it uses energy and you have to use real money Witch sucks by the way so 2 stars.
A134N15U58YLEG B00AW3FDIO 5 1377388800 26 At first I did not think this would be to much fun but I decided to try it.  Love it I highly reccommended to every one.
A134N15U58YLEG B00ECWDP8G 5 1379203200 33 I have always whanted to password protect my Kindlefire like my phone this app is awesome tor that one of my faverate features is that you can lock apps one by one to.
A134N15U58YLEG B008841TP0 5 1340064000 35 THIS GAME IS NOT MINECRAFY SO STOP COMPARING IT. This game is awesome it has a ton of monsters and actually has missions you can do its amazing hoping to buy the full version soon.
A134N15U58YLEG B004T2QZL8 2 1332201600 30 would be 5 star but to many force closes I'm sorry I don't recommend this app to any one until it is fixed so please fix this my faverout app
A134N15U58YLEG B004T3K50E 1 1335916800 31 It wont download on my kindle fire I deleted three apps turned it off and nothing just the Sam error saying installation failed try shin so don't get waste of mouney
A134N15U58YLEG B0080K98U0 5 1336780800 24 The story line is a little confusing if you played ZENONIA 3 but awesome game play I love it keep up the good work.

A134NSL9WOBBCH B00892MNI8 5 1342742400 26 I think this app is very fun. I would suggest this app to everyone. Plus the game is free. I would pay $2.99 for this game.
A134NSL9WOBBCH B006OCM0G0 1 1342569600 27 When I first got this app it was good. Then it started to cause problems. Then I got rid of it from all the problems it caused.
A134NSL9WOBBCH B008K6GKW8 2 1357084800 24 This app is not good at all because the controls are hard to use and power ups are useless. do not get this app.
A134NSL9WOBBCH B00B55N4KM 5 1386892800 48 I recommend this game to everyone who likes shooting games. There are many places to fight and 5 levels in each place. There are many weapons and armor. Here is some advice if your system is not working with online play, restart it.  Hope you like this game.
A134Q6EQDA8Y4B B0066T0BTO 4 1337126400 30 I really like the ui and also the content, and it is a lot of fun. I have been playing it all the time since I bought it last weekend.
A134Q6EQDA8Y4B B008N8IV2U 4 1370563200 24 this is a very good app, i like it very much. I had a lot of fun playing it. I recommend it to everyone.
A134QHADNA8BZN B008N8IV2U 4 1344211200 27 for every one who's stuck on Lvl 3 tilt the kindle from side to side. and can someone please tell me how to get past Lvl 4.
A134QHADNA8BZN B005ZFOOE8 5 1404432000 27 I fall asleep to this app every night! I couldn't live with out it! I still have six words left so I'm just typing wh&agrave;t I'm thinking
A134RC722Q5MUD B0063IH60K 4 1373760000 54 It is a fun old time favorite solitary, I like the fact that you can change background colors of cards, but don't like after game that when you shuffle cards ads pop up. Also you can pick your hand to have great idea also their are hints along the way if you get stuck.
A134RC722Q5MUD B004MC8CA2 3 1373673600 48 I was disappointed to learn that i couldnt acess without wifi, theirs no need for a bible if I cant read it when i want if i cant carry my bible with me, like work or just when i dont want to carry bulk. I will be removing
A134RC722Q5MUD B005ZXWMUS 5 1382140800 49 It is a excellent app I have only had  a couple of times where it didn't load up but the movies are quality picture as far as presentations purposes, so I love Netflix on my kindle fire I watch all the movies I want for q small monthly fee.
A134RC722Q5MUD B009PSV1HE 3 1372550400 52 It is  a fun game but you can't even sit one per as almost, before someone else is finish eating not  very realistic but it is fun. I would have given higher stars if more realistic and the points or tips are hard to achieve and a little ridiculous on some levels
A134RC722Q5MUD B008M721MS 5 1373932800 20 I can talk to family, friends on the go this is excellent when I am not at my desk top.
A134RC722Q5MUD B009ZZDNT6 2 1375488000 78 I had this app awhile on my kindle but never used, yesterday I used it for the first time to wake me at 6:30, I am generally a light sleeper as long as I get proper rest. I did but, when the alarm we off it was so faint you could barely hear it and my volume was maxed. I will be deleting it, it is good for looking at the time but not for a alarm clock.
A134RC722Q5MUD B00CWY76CC 3 1380412800 35 Hard to understand what I was doing didn't know how to get out of the room once I solved all the puzzles it doesn't give you any clues don't waste your time, like for real!!!!!!!
A134RC722Q5MUD B00A4EZ3QS 3 1382140800 32 Fun game once you learn how to master getting one group before your time runs out and it is addictive,I had to ply several times before I got the hang of it.
A134RC722Q5MUD B00A7HP4C0 4 1371340800 30 It is for kids I think, very easy, I like it I am a kid at heart. I wish you could go to different levels but not in burger making
A134RC722Q5MUD B009KS4XRO 2 1384128000 28 I didn't like it is too fast  to keep up with in my opinion and is not fun to me I suppose I am not a bingo player.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B009UX2YAC 5 1359158400 39 Subway surfers is one of the best games I've ever gotten it was introduced to me by one of my colleagues at school I would happily recommend it to anyone who likes Temple Run but wants something more colorful.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B006HJKKCG 2 1392076800 45 we have foreign exchange students all the time, and wanted to try this app the mess with them, little did I know that this app needs Wi-fi to work. so unless you have a mobile phone, or are always around Wi-fi, this app is useless.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B009G1J62C 5 1392076800 50 Whenever I am bored I immediately go to this game. I have spent many hours on this app, building, and testing to see if the new even more complicated machine i built will hold up the terrain. Subway Surfers and Bad Piggies, the top two free games on the market.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B00ET56Y48 1 1392076800 46 This game is okay. Not like the Bloons I have been playing for years, but its fine. The main reason I dislike it is the fact that in order for you to play past the tutorial, you have to connect to Wi-fi, which I don't have.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B009HN0V6E 5 1392076800 109 I got this app for free due to the free amazon coins that come with buying a Kindle Fire HD. I use it all the time. Say I need diamonds, close Minecraft, open the app, modify your inventory, and there you go, diamonds for free. I love the ability to modify the blocks too. Hate gravel (I know I do) then enter the app, click replace blocks, select gravel from the browse section, and there you go, now you get to decide what useful block to replace all that terrible gravel with. Overall I love this app, and all the things it can do for such a small price.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B0087SGWI6 1 1392076800 50 Yet another app sent to prey on people. This app installs both adware, spyware, and corrupts your device. This is terrible, so terrible in fact I almost had to get a new Kindle, because the viruses were that hard to get rid of. A word of caution, DO NOT BUY!
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B008JGSM6G 5 1359158400 41 I absolutely love flow free flow free, unlike other games it includes  many levels for just the free version it is by far 1 of my favorite games I've ever gotten. I specially love the puzzle aspect of it very engaging
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B009VSW15Y 4 1359158400 79 I'm very happy with this app, they let me to access the camera function of my kindle fire HD. It is a great app and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to use the Kindle as a camera. or for anyone who just wants to make videos of the other friends messing around. IT has a camera feature, a video recording feature, and Apple's claim to fame, the panorama picture. Overall I'm very satisfied with the app.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383955200 31 I love this game, it is both addictive and awesome. The best part is it's on Kindle!  So now US kindle owners can play the game that everyone is talking about.
A134YH9UFZBPA2 B009ZZDNT6 4 1392076800 63 I have had this app for a while, and find it to perform all the things I need to to. Unless you want Custom clock faces, you really don's need the Pro version, this works perfectly. Plus the blue numbers, on black make it cool to look at, and not bright while trying to sleep, if you use it for an alarm clock.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00AIQP9DE 4 1356566400 31 Great game; I enjoyed the sytory -! It was entertaining and the graphics were great. Most importantly, it functioned perfectly and never crashed, like some of them do. Worth the price.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00HJ4G1MQ 5 1397433600 41 Finally a game worth the purchase price. Great story and graphics, creative HOs. Yes, there are cut scenes, but they're much better than those tedious back and forth dialogues. Now I just hope it lasts more than a couple of hours.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00E5MN3DU 4 1379116800 58 This was an enjoyable game with a fun story, nice graphics, and great functionality. There were lots of puzzles; they were just hard enough but not frustrating. They did a good job of letting the game be the star. The game responded well; it was easy to collect items, navigate, and zoom. I will play this one again.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00II5YUIW 4 1403827200 48 This was a creative game with a fun story with games that we're just difficult enough. The HOs were the assembly kind and not gratuitous. Hope there will be more in this series. Only complaint is that it is too short. Only took a few hours to complete.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00CWG9EUM 5 1370390400 65 Another great one from G5, with a good story (that doesn't interfere with play), nice graphics, and fun puzzles. It's been a long time since G5 has released a really, really good game; this is one and I am very pleased and look forward to more like it. Definitely worth the price. I do appreciate the opportunity to test drive before investing, so thanks G5.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00IFXI4LQ 5 1402099200 21 This was a really fun and long game. Entertaining, great art. Hope there will be many more like this. Functions well.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00HG3VFYO 5 1388275200 77 At first I wasn't sure about this one. I thought it might be cheesy and the art in the sample shots wasn't that great. However, now that I'm into the game I'm really enjoying it. The level of difficulty is just right - I can figure out the next steps without having to constantly refer to the guide. Nice story and the art is nice. Hoping Big Fish will produce many more at this level of quality.,
A134YX9UJAM20L B00IIOFVYA 4 1397260800 43 I'm enjoying this game. Good story, not too many cut scenes or lengthy HOs. I've noticed that many recent games are really short so hopefully the high price tag on this on means it will be longer than just a couple of hours.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00J4JZRQK 3 1396742400 50 This was a good game with a decent story and interesting games. The graphics were OK; not  particularly imaginative but I didn't mind because the game was entertaining. However, it was way too short - took just a few hours to get to the end, which was pretty lame itself.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00A77II0U 4 1359417600 45 Not as good a story or graphics as with some games like Dragonwheel, Empress of the Deep or Shadowlands, and the voodoo doll looks too much like Elmo, but it functions well and mini games are good. Overall a fun game and worth the money.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00CWY76CC 5 1371945600 33 This is a fun game that takes some thought, but doesn't frustrate you or drive you straight to a walkthrough. Onlly on level 5 so I hope there are a lot more levels.
A134YX9UJAM20L B0097GVJWQ 5 1357430400 31 This is a well done game with good graphics and story. HO games zoom well; story is entertaining and there are several locations and puzzles. G5 should stick to this model.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00BI3AFPI 5 1362528000 43 Big Fish has returned to the formula that works. Great story, graphics, and functionality. I particularly like that the inventory and hint buttons don't take up a lot of space, and there are no giant blinking directional arrows to distract from the game.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00CT9ZVGI 5 1379721600 31 I enjoyed this game. functionality was good, as was the story. puzzles not too hard. I would've. liked a little less HO, but overall quite entertaining. would play more like this.
A134YX9UJAM20L B00ATDOVNK 5 1359158400 29 This is the kind of game I really love - great story without too much talking to slow you down. Very creative, complex play. Taps and zooming work well.
A1351LCBUHDM5L B00BG3ID0Y 5 1362614400 31 play this game if ur a good puzzle solver and use it to hv fun with friends and family while on the road or at home when ever and whhere ever
A1351LCBUHDM5L B00D0VA0UQ 3 1371427200 22 it takes time to do and brain power along with memory work its a funn but hard game and i like it

A1352H4F8TMVMV B00EBQRSTK 4 1376697600 24 this game is easy enough for young kids to play. lots of fun hours of entertainment plus learning too. love it! great value too.
A1357F4E3JL6IR B004MC8CA2 4 1368403200 323 I have been using the app for over a month and I'm ready to add my review now. Before I purchased I read every review and weighed the options carefully and as there are lot's of reviews written already I'll add some bullet points...Cons: Things that made me hold off buying initially from reviews I read- Yes it asks for unusual permisions for an app like this but I haven't noticed and problems from that- Yes it occasionally freezes and hangs, maybe once a week and I am a daily user. I do a force stop in applications and I'm on my way.- Reviewers said it caused latency on their device... I have not found this to be the case but I have a fairly new Kindle Fire HDPro's- This is excellent for what it is... it is a Bible Reading app it is not a set of exhaustive Bible study tools and there are no add-on's that I am aware of.- What I love are the countless Bible reading schedules that walk you through various portions of the Bible or topics.I'm glad I tried it.. it's free. If you don't like it you can just delete it from your device. No ad's or messiness with it. It's a clean app no malware/virus.It is account based so you can also go to their website and log in and on your other devices and have access to you saved states.You can post the scripture of the day or your completed reading plans to FB etc.. but I haven't seen where you can post any scripture to FB... it's not obvious if it's there and I haven't done any investigation into it.**Update June 3rd**Since writing this I have learned that I had a network problem at home and most of the times the bible app stopped were because of that glitch. I love this app and use it daily for my personal study with God!
A1357F4E3JL6IR B008Y212PI 5 1380499200 26 Simple to start with progressively harder levels. I recommend it for relaxation or brain training. I've only finished the first level but look forward to more
A1359ISPUEDGSE B0069G5Z9K 5 1345420800 21 i have been waiting for this game to come out for ki dle for 4 months finally it is out !!!!!!!!&hearts;

A135ATTNFW8EWS B00EEDJHXA 5 1394582400 27 love it is great !!!! no hidden &#34;you have to buy more game time or points&#34;  just plain and simple good gaming!!!!  Well done, fun and challenging.

A135GLQJ5AE5NL B0064X7FVE 5 1392595200 25 i want to know what kind of weather is coming before i walk the dog, so i am checking weather a few times a day.
A135GLQJ5AE5NL B0064X7B4A 4 1400198400 30 great game to learn how to spell and learn new words. It is a good for all ages, and you can start more than one game with the same person.
A135JHYMK2IQBN B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384473600 43 I was skeptical at first, but have since played this titanic escape and enjoy it very much. I like the story line and feel as if I am really on the titanic trying to find my way off. It's a lot of fun.
A135JHYMK2IQBN B00CSR2J9I 5 1370908800 34 I can not stop playing this game and I'm a grown adult!!! Just when I think I've nailed the driving technique, I flip! Only makes me want to drive harder baby! Love this game!!
A135JHYMK2IQBN B00AR1AUAW 5 1370908800 27 I did not think a word association game would be challenging, but I was wrong. This game is both fun and challenging. I enjoy it very much!
A135JHYMK2IQBN B00CWY76CC 5 1371686400 32 My 11yr old son and I had lots of fun trying to escape each room. Awesome game! Can't wait for more rooms. App worked great with no problems at all. Definitely recommend!!!
A135JHYMK2IQBN B00GP0G0IK 5 1390694400 29 Captivating! Keeps me wanting to see more. I feel as if I'm trying to solve a real life mystery. Great game, lots of fun! Great work by the developers.
A135JHYMK2IQBN B004UBH4S6 5 1393027200 60 I love this app! I look forward to reading my horoscope every day. This app is quite accurate. Sometimes I don't get a chance to read it in the mornings, so I read it at night time and find that it is very relevant to my day. App is quick to load, and graphics are clear and simple. Great app!
A135JHYMK2IQBN B00L3MNCNQ 5 1405900800 48 This game is so much fun! The scenes vary so much they keep you interested and eager to see the next picture. The time frame is very fare and with all the &quot;life lines,&quot; your set for success! You will NOT get bored easily! Great game! Love it!!!
A135ROW4PMH2H3 B00AW3FDIO 3 1373328000 26 This is a pretty fun game but would be so much better with regular up dates and add onsTo enhance the game play exp .......................  ............
A135ROW4PMH2H3 B00B2V66VS 3 1364601600 36 Love the eye popping grafics hope they come with updated for this version to enhance the game play like more of a story line or something after a while the game just gets  boring and repetative
A135ROW4PMH2H3 B00AIUUXHC 5 1364601600 35 My kids love this game my 12 yo spent all day upgrading the sharks I thought it was ok imfelt the concept was great but they could of done so much more then they did
A135S2N8P7JHS9 B0061SLW7A 5 1327622400 22 this is awesome, you can design your avatar, then a voice you like, its very nice, and gets me everything I NEED!!!!!!!'!!!!

A135S2N8P7JHS9 B007MFEESK 5 1333238400 25 Omg! I luuuuuuuuuuvvvvvvv this game. I got the free version first and I just needed the full version. this is not a waste of money!
A135S2N8P7JHS9 B0061OACXO 2 1326585600 65 I like the company, ModiFace&copy; but this was not their best app. There make-over app is GREAT!!!! Oh and by the way, the reason why the nails are sooooooooo blurry is because your phone or whatever you have has to low RAM for the app. Soooooooo really you shouldn't be blaming the app or company, blame your choice of phone, tablet or whatever u got.
A135YEES0VGUFA B006T4IJTK 1 1334793600 82 For the high score on a brick breaker game to be only 210 points, there has to be something wrong with the game:Paddle controlled by touch is a step up from a trackball, but it has lag issues that make you miss the basll even when you moved your finger to the spot before the ball got there.Once the ball speeds up it won't slow down.I've found uses for lots of the FAotD apps, but this made my "remove from cloud" list.
A135YEES0VGUFA B0087EACJK 1 1364947200 52 When I swiped left and it jumped right, I knew I wouldn't have fun "playing" this game. After restarting the level, trying to jump right made him twitch on the screen like someone being electrocuted. At that point, I knew I would be uninstalling this crAPP.It made my "remove from cloud" list.
A135YEES0VGUFA B008S3EJSU 4 1397260800 108 Classic console game, now on android.File size is 1.8GB for standard (download this one unless you have a tablet with a large HD screen that has sufficient free space for the HD version) and 3.6GB for HD.Hilarious game where you play as "The Bard" (an anti-hero). The Bard can hear the narrator and talks back to the narrator at times. It doesn't force you to progress through the storyline, so you can go back to visit the town of Houton (or other places you might want to revisit) any time you want (at least until you go to the mountain,that's as far as I've gone in the game).
A135YEES0VGUFA B00GRVV29E 4 1394150400 84 I got this app as the FAotD and was looking forward to using it to help me relax. Upon initially launching the app, my phone rebooted. After the reboot, every attempt to open the app resulted in the opening screen (with "SUNGLAB" logo on it) then the app closing. I uninstalled it and waited a month before checking to see if it had been fixed. The developer has fixed the issue with an update and now it works. Now I can enjoy this app.
A135YEES0VGUFA B006ZAY5GY 1 1391472000 22 Didn't work on my device. 2 brightness was the same as 128.  It didn't change the brightness on my phone at all.
A135YEES0VGUFA B00AEEZK70 1 1365379200 62 I'm not colorblind but it is hard to tell the green from the yellow on this app. The blocks start out slow, but after a few minutes you are lucky if you can keep them from piling up past the "end game" line.  Too frustrating to play. I'm gonna stick to Tetris for my clear-the-blocks-before-the-pile-up-too-high gaming.This made my "remove from cloud" list.
A135YEES0VGUFA B0096A9QXC 1 1398297600 155 I went through the first level a couple times, got too frustrated with the app to continue. The instructions say to use your finger to pop the frogs, so I did the first time. The second time I used my thumbs and got more frogs popped. But I'd have to practically double my score from using my thumbs to get the 5-star rating on the first level. For that I'd need more time, but I'd have to purchase "clocks" with real money to get the extra time. I disagree on principle with purchasing ANYTHING to get through the first level of a PAID app. A lot of people were talking about handing this to a child in their reviews. There is no way that I'd ever hand a device with this app open on it (or on it period) to a child. This app easily made it onto my "Uninstall and Delete from Cloud" list.
A135YEES0VGUFA B00DQR26EC 3 1398211200 96 When using the &amp;#34;Shutdown&amp;#34; option on the main menu, sometimes the data gets corrupted. The highlight on the menus changes to a black block and the backgrounds all turn black. I emailed the developer and they said they were releasing an update to fix it, but even after the update it still shows version 1.6.9.0...The google play store has version 1.7.0.1 for its current version, so when will we be able to get it here on amazon? I don't want to have to pay for an app on google play that I already got through amazon.
A135YEES0VGUFA B00BS85W88 1 1396137600 55 It vibrates when your guess is incorrect and there is no way to turn off the vibration setting. I don't want to use an app, especially a game, if I can't keep it from vibrating in my hands. Docked 4 stars for the bad programming and lack of controls to compensate for it and uninstalled.
A135YEES0VGUFA B006OOHVVC 3 1373932800 43 It was the FAotD on 7/26/2012 and now it is FAotD again less than a year later (7/16/2013).You fill in the blanks in the puzzle with the letters of the alphabet. All 26 letters are used and each letter is only used once.
A135YEES0VGUFA B005A89508 3 1336348800 82 Tried it on a WWF game with my dad. Of the top 3 results, only the 3rd one was a playable word in the game, and I would have come up with it on my own. The top 2 had point values stated in the 30s and #3 had a stated point value of 24.  When I played it, I got 48 points for the word. Apparently when you play through multiple double-word spaces, this app only doubles the word score once.
A135YEES0VGUFA B00CBT4F3G 4 1395014400 49 I've got a phone with a 4.3" screen and was expecting not to be able to read the font in the game (because I read the reviews while it downloaded and they complained about the font on their 10" screens), but the font size is fine on my phone.
A135YEES0VGUFA B008N02WZU 1 1356825600 110 Hard to judge distances so hitting the target is more difficult than it should be. Others have said they got to level 3 or level 7, but I couldn't get past level 2. Why? I'm good at hidden object games and there was only one target that I could find and when I broke it I was only 22% through with the level...? How about 20% (5 targets) or 25% (4 targets) instead? No matter how much I searched I couldn't find any additional targets, so couldn't progress past level 2.Free crap of the day 12/30/2012!This one made my "Remove from Cloud" list! Don't waste your time on this one!
A135YEES0VGUFA B007A2IPF8 5 1365379200 94 I bought the free version and was disappointed at how little could be played on it: 60MB (basically) should be more than 1 1/2 chapters. So I paid $4.99 for the full version and was able to play the whole game. I've played it over and over. The only complaint I have is that when you buy the full version from the free version you have to download 60MB again and since I don't have wifi at home I have top go find and connect to wifi to download anything that size from amazon.
A135YEES0VGUFA B009DDKZT6 2 1372809600 177 1. No in-game exit command. You have to press the home button on your android device to exit the app.2. Rotation vs. spin doesn't always work. To spin the cube, swype in the direction you want to spin it. To rotate, touch 2 points on the screen and rotate those 2 touched points around in the direction you want the cube to rotate. Simple enough? Except when you try to rotate the cube and all it will do is spin!3. Pieces &quot;sticking&quot; to your finger! You read it right! Instead of being able to put the piece onto the cube or back in the ready with the unused pieces, a piece will sometimes get &quot;stuck&quot;to your finger so that anywhere you tap the piece goes! This includes the in-game menu button and the restart puzzle button. When this happens you MUST exit the app and if you want to continue playing you will need to re-launch the app.Other than these 3 bugs, it is a fun puzzle game. App version 1.8 running on Android version 2.3.52013/07/03 FAotD
A135YEES0VGUFA B007A2IOOU 2 1333065600 88 Both the free and paid versions of the app are 59.9MB but the free version will only let you play 1 spell and part of another.  Having to go find wifi and sit there to wait for 60MB (basically) to download for 1 spell is not worth it.Go for the full version ($4.99) if you like it, but beware -  when you buy, you have to download the 60MB AGAIN!The free version only made my "remove from cloud" list because I bought the full version:Magician's Handbook: Cursed Valley
A135YEES0VGUFA B00G9B1MEM 1 1396396800 44 It kept flickering between a screen that said it was loading and another that seemed to be a menu screen but didn't have any menu options on it. I tried to exit with the back button, but that was futile. Force closed and uninstalled.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B007NZV2HK 3 1359158400 20 OKAY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T REALLY PLAYED IT THAT MUCH. I DON'T CARE ABOUT HOW THEY JUST CHANGE THE GAME EITHER.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B004HGK6FW 5 1359158400 45 INTERESTING- HOWEVER, I HAVE NOT LEARNED THE CORRECT WAY TO PLAY THE GAME YET.  MY FAMILY LOVES TO PLAY IT.  MY SON AND GRANDDAUGHTER CAN REALLY PLAY IT AND IT LOOKS SO EASY.  I GOT TO LEARN IT SO THAT IS WHY I GOT IT.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B0099AQQPK 5 1359158400 28 LOVES POKER - ENJOY IT - JUST LEARNING TO PLAY POKER REALLY.  I LOVE DOING THIS BECAUSE I AM LEARNING AND PREPARING FOR OUR FAMILY NIGHT POKER GAME.

A135Z8UNW8DRZU B00B2V66VS 4 1359158400 20 GOOD GAME--VERY EXCITING TO  PLAY TO MY GRANDSON WHO IS 6 YEARS OLD.  IT IS INTERESTING TO PLAY TO ME.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B005HSL626 5 1359158400 36 FUN GAME AND GOOD FOR KIDS.  I LIKE PLAYING THE GAME BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT KIND OF KNIFES ANDFRUIT, ONLY THING I HAVE TO LEARN TO DO IT FASTER, I AM A LITTLE BIT TOO  SLOW.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B0086700CM 5 1359158400 30 GOOD GAME FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER (15 YEARS OLD).  SHE LOVES TO PLAY THIS GAME BECAUSE THE OTHERS DON'T OR CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME, THEY PLAY THE OTHER TEMPLE RUN GAME.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B006HXXJH0 4 1359158400 24 GOOD FOR KIDS (EXCITING TO MY 3 & 6 YEARS OLD GRANDKIDS).  I LOVE JUST WATCHING THEM PLAY, ESPECIALLY MY 3 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B0063IH60K 5 1359158400 23 VERY ENJOYABLE AND RELAXING WHEN I AM JUST SITTING AROUND WITH NOTHING TO DO.  I LIKE SOLITAIRE EVEN WHEN I PLAY WITH CARDS.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B004SJ3BCI 5 1359158400 26 VERY INTERESTING TO ME AND GOOD FOR KIDS.  I LOVE THIS GAME JUST STARTED PLAYING IT, BUT IT IS MY FAVORITE GAME.  I LOVE THOSE BIRDS.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B0064TVQ5E 5 1359158400 22 FUN GAME FOR ALL.  WE HAVE A LARGE FAMILY AND EACH ONE LIKE TO PLAY THE GAME AT OUR FAMILY'S GET TOGETHER.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B0087SGWI6 5 1359158400 22 GOOD GAME -FOR THE BRAIN-IT MAKE YOU THINK AND HOLD YOU ATTENTION BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL NOT CONQUER THE TASK.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B00A9JG6RS 3 1359158400 22 THIS GAME IS A GOOD GAME FOR THE GRAND CHILDREN BECAUSE IT HOLDS THEIR INTEREST AND KEEPS THEM STILL FOR A WHILE.
A135Z8UNW8DRZU B005V1N71W 5 1359158400 35 LOVE TO LISTEN TO GOOD MUSIC.  I DON'T HAVE A PREFERENCE I JUST LIKE MUSIC ALL TYPES (ROCK 'N' ROLL (OLDIES), COUNTRY, GOSPEL AND PRAISE AND WORSHIP.  PRAISE AND WORSHIP IS MY FAVORITE, THEN OLDIES.
A136001MDNC6PD B0064X7FVE 5 1384300800 39 I started using the app primarily for the mpoints .......but after using the app.... I see that it is cool and useful.....Love the channel and guess what...... I love the app as well! I say give it a try...
A136001MDNC6PD B007RZF3YE 5 1381536000 38 Very cool game... it is fun hearing the animals sound effect when you tend to them.... very infectious if you have spare time to invest in to it. I like it... I love it..... give it a try.....
A1365G6LT8LN2W B009UX2YAC 5 1392422400 26 It is a little bit of a challenge but definitely fun. I  think you should get this game cause not only is it fun it's free.
A1365G6LT8LN2W B007N5YIUS 5 1389139200 20 I love space angry birds it's challenging and fun at the same time. Don't worry it's not too hard though.
A1365G6LT8LN2W B00F1RR3Y8 4 1389139200 50 I like it but the only thing is that you only get so much and the rest you have to pay money for. So it's all up to you but know that it's not the full package but it is fun so play games, have fun and God bless you.
A1365G6LT8LN2W B0067VKQLE 5 1389139200 38 My brother has this game on his Xbox and I played and loved it one problem with he barely ever let me play and now that I have it on my kindle fire HD I am really happy!!!
A1365G6LT8LN2W B005HSL626 5 1389139200 22 It's fun and you can get free coupons for playing the game by going to extras and signing up it's really easy
A1365G6LT8LN2W B008OOYALE 4 1388188800 28 I like it but when I expanded the area I couldn't put anything there. Waste of coins!!! Which is easy to get but it costs lots of coins.
A1365G6LT8LN2W B00DUGCLY4 5 1404000000 32 This game is really fun but it's challenging you have to think really hard. (You have to be a pretty good speller too). There's nothing I don't really like so 5 stars!!
A1365RYO0BLEMI B00A3LSW7Y 5 1359590400 29 I recommend this to anyone in need of a game which will elevate their being. Not difficult but lovely and food for the soul, heart, and mind. Thank you.
A1365RYO0BLEMI B009XFDFPU 5 1362787200 29 fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun funI love puzzle mode. Peaceful. Fun. Very addictive. Zen like. Mind enhancing. Enchanting.
A1365RYO0BLEMI B004U75OYG 5 1332028800 90 I am amazed this mastermind clone is free. It is incredible and I am convinced.it will help your overall thought process. Don't discount it based on the fact that it is a game or inexpensive.  It is a mind gym.My wife loves this. She has a masters degree in mathematics. She finds this an intellectual exercise that doesn't affect her carpel tunnel problems. Wonderful game and I got it free. I've paid 99 cents for games that were horrible. This is magnificent and I would definitely buy an upgraded version.
A1369I5KLZZLLS B0066T8OH0 3 1349654400 37 This a fun version of Tetris.  Same basic game it's always been.  It is lacking the original, catchy music.  In my opinion, the touch controls aren't ideal for this sort of game.  Otherwise, it's an entertaining, time-killer.
A1369I5KLZZLLS B008O661PK 4 1352073600 23 This was a pretty straightforward, entertaining game.  Fairly easy puzzles and a good time-killer.  I'd say it was worth the 99 cent cost!
A1369I5KLZZLLS B008BM3TKM 3 1349654400 28 This was an entertaining and not too challenging game.  It was pretty short, though.  Very little replay value.  But I got it for cheap, and it was fun.
A136KGJPEYV42D B007N5YIOO 5 1344902400 20 Any time I am waiting for anything I play Angry Birds. I also like it to play and challenge myself.
A136KGJPEYV42D B00A2RZDZI 5 1355270400 25 This version of angry birds obviuosly has many similarities to the others. Biut they did come up with new &#34;bird weapons&#34;, and they are fun.
A136KGJPEYV42D B004ANMWPY 2 1347494400 23 This is not very good. Limited in what it does for you.This is not very good. Limited in what it does for you.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00F7YHDWC 5 1388620800 113 This was a free app, so I figured, what the heck?  I love the song and the music video, so even if the game is cheesy, it's worth trying out for free.  I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable and addictive it is, especially since if you're able to keep up with the challenges, the speed keeps increasing on multiple rounds.  You can unlock characters, but I'm not sure what for, unless they equal new mini-games, and you can also unlock the music video, which you can always have with you on your Kindle at the ready.  I probably wouldn't have paid for it, but it was definitely a nice grab for free.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00A3E2BVE 2 1388620800 80 If you're going to play this game, you're better off sticking to playing it on Facebook via your computer.  Half the time it doesn't load properly.  Though, one thing I did prefer on the app over the computer version is that you were able to see all of the songs on a playlist before you &#34;bought&#34; it.  The app in itself is enjoyable, and it was fun to have SongPop immediately ready to play, if only it would properly load.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00AIUUXHC 5 1366502400 28 This game is loads of fun and will keep you &quot;hooked&quot; for days!  Reminds me of some of the games I've stayed up for hours playing on Kongregate.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00IF2JW8G 3 1396828800 112 I got this as a free app, which was awesome because hey, it's Sonic, and who wouldn't want a Sonic game for free?  The graphics are good, the power-ups are decent enough (though you have to pay coins to keep using them and they don't last forever), and the boss battles are incredibly easy.  Has anyone else ever been able to hold onto their rings?  I have been playing Sonic games for years, and the rings only serve as a defense for me when I ultimately hit into something sharp (which usually happens right after I collect rings).  Rarely do I end a stage being in the plus with my ring count.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00GIZO674 4 1396483200 138 Pros: I want to say that this game is like Burger Time was back in the day on Atari, but it is so much more than that.  Here, you serve people orders that get increasingly more complicated.  You have to be quick, too, or people will lose their patience and leave in a huff, which results in less tips for you.Cons: You may gain weight, because this game will have you wanting more orders of burgers and fries than you&#8217;ve ever eaten in your life.  Also, the challenges keep piling up on top of each other like layers on a burger.  While that no doubt makes the game more fun, sometimes you feel like you&#8217;ve barely mastered the new thing you just unlocked before you&#8217;re already tackling yet another new thing.  Again, it&#8217;s fun, but also sometimes frustrating.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00GY0HJ4K 4 1396483200 145 Pros: This is a fun, addictive game where you have to match up as many jellies as you can to clear the boards.  Of course, as you go on, there are additional challenges, like connecting a "trapped" jelly to several others of its same color to "free" it.  The sounds of this game are quite pleasing to the ear and are reminiscent of summer.Cons: Like Candy Crush Saga, you only get five lives.  If you keep beating boards, then you can play for as long as you want, but if you can't meet the goals of each board, then you only get five tries before you have to wait for your lives to fill up again.  Also, once you've reached level 40, you either have to pay tokens to advance forward or link the game to your Facebook in order to ask friends for help.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B009UX2YAC 4 1396483200 173 Pros: Sure, some may think of this as just a Temple Run rip-off, but I actually like it a bit better than Temple Run.  For one thing, the pacing of it is slowed down, so you don&#8217;t die as quickly as you do in Temple Run.  It also has more of a cartoonish vibe, which makes it pleasing to the eye, and you acquire power-ups similarly to the way in which you achieve them in Jetpack Joyride.Cons: You have to collect so many of the same item in order to unlock stuff - like, I&#8217;m talking 250 items to unlock a character.  Even if you play this game regularly, you&#8217;re still going to invest many hours in it before you earn these items since, of course, they are randomized.  Unless, of course, you believe in micro-transactions.  Also, power-ups are all temporary, so once you invest in say, five sets of sneakers, after you use all five, they&#8217;re history.  You can&#8217;t secure a permanent set of sneakers, or whichever power-up is your personal favorite.
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B00F8H0LM2 5 1386806400 31 Such a great game, and especially for free.  I'm just hoping the new worlds that are &#34;coming soon&#34; are coming sooner rather than later - I want more boards to play!
A136MAOWGCU2C2 B007N85POS 5 1386892800 81 Anything that gives me more Angry Birds boards, especially for free, is something I can get behind.  I've never seen &#34;Rio,&#34; but I don't really care, because this game is pretty awesome nonetheless.  You have to wait less time between moves than you do on &#34;Angry Birds: Star Wars,&#34; and one of the neat new graphics is the birds that fly away when you break the cages.  You don't need to have seen &#34;Rio&#34; to enjoy the &#34;Angry Birds: Rio&#34; game.
A136NF27F5NEIZ B00HCU7OCI 5 1397174400 21 This is one of the greatest grand theft auto games I've ever played on Kendall fire he and it works perfectly.AMAZING
A136NF27F5NEIZ B00F7YHDWC 3 1393459200 63 This game is fun and all but if I want to play again an ad shows up a nd I have to watch a stupid video and then I get to play but when I want to start again I have to watch another stupid video so all I'm asking is for the creators of dumb ways to die to REMOVE THE ADS!!!!!!
A136NF27F5NEIZ B009HKL4B8 4 1393804800 31 It's a great game and it's fun the only problem with it is that you need internet to play it if you didn't need internet it would be worth 5 stars.
A136NF27F5NEIZ B00FAX6XQC 5 1393459200 33 This game is fun and easy also I like how you have the chance to save yourself when the animal jumps at you. I suggest that you try this game out it's GREAT
A136QEWVGZQUKN B00A4KVFLY 4 1399766400 29 The only downfall is paying for coins. I have t o wait a day to get my next spin. That sucks. They need another way to get free coins.
A136QEWVGZQUKN B00ABGEFWC 1 1369440000 23 My 3 year old keeps trying this app but it isn't easy to use and it is very hard to exit from it.
A136QEWVGZQUKN B00BGDEK9C 4 1369440000 20 Easy to use and addicting. My 3 year old can play it! I would recommend this game if youlike bowling...
A136QEWVGZQUKN B009UX2YAC 5 1369440000 33 My 3 year old son plays this and loves it!  It is easy for him to manuever and he is great at it!  My husband even downloaded this to his phone.  Fun App!!
A136QEWVGZQUKN B00ABGFFOO 5 1369440000 21 My son loves this game...it is so simple but he always comes back to it. I would recommend it for kids...
A136QEWVGZQUKN B009WO7NQO 4 1369440000 26 My son accidentally downloaded this and started playing it one day...now he loves it and plays all the time! Angry birds are fun to him now.
A136TIEWKQ2E3P B00I8Q77Y0 5 1394323200 20 I think it is better than flappy bird. You should get it and the pipes change colors after awhile, too.
A136UJR2BSC5G6 B0063GSL60 3 1327017600 27 FreeCell works fine but is dull and colorless in comparison to other apps. Do not expect the cover picture to reflect what the game will look like.
A136UJR2BSC5G6 B0072KBY2Y 5 1332547200 24 This app is great. It works even for remote areas giving suggestions for all you might need. Wont travel without using the YP app.
A136UJR2BSC5G6 B0063IH60K 1 1353024000 35 Tesseract makes its games without advertisements they have explanations for an incredible amount of games. Check it out you will never use the MobilityWare games again. I am so glad I gave them a try.
A136UJR2BSC5G6 B0055SWM08 1 1353024000 36 This game is too slow.  When I need to destress the lah dee dab atmosphere only serves to irritate me.  The early games are crazy easy, mix that with the lay dee dah it becomes monotonous.
A136UJR2BSC5G6 B005V1N71W 5 1349827200 34 I live on the side of a mountian surrounded by trees and unable to receive radio signals; even Sirrius failed. Pandora is the answer for anyone living in a rural area. I love PANDORA!
A136UJR2BSC5G6 B004GMT14Y 5 1383782400 28 use this app on my PC, my cell phone (windows edition which I LOVE) and on my Kindle. Turns out I use the Thesaurus more than the Dictionary.
A136X70Y888XUR B00AEC8UVU 5 1393804800 42 Awesome mashing type game. Has a few mini games mixed in to make it challenging. Those have the option to skip if they are too hard. I couldn't put it down and would love more games like this. A lot of fun.
A136X70Y888XUR B007T8Z5PG 3 1336780800 22 $6.99? really? pro worth it but I can't spend that much on any game on here with the chance of disliking it.
A136X70Y888XUR B00AE6SS5O 5 1356480000 28 title says it all...cute and fun. lots of different little challenges and mini games. I got it as the FAOTD but I would pay 99&cent; if need be
A136X70Y888XUR B00BGBZGEW 5 1361836800 26 fun and challenging....worth purchasing the Pd. app for letter hints. highly recommend this game! go ahead and try it as the faotd and then hug it!
A136X70Y888XUR B00BS3UFCQ 3 1366243200 39 fun game but its a little difficult. has a lot of generic cartoon pics as hints for a movie so its often hard to figure out the movie unless you know it w/out a doubt or use a hint
A136X70Y888XUR B0086700CM 5 1338076800 26 it's finally on the fire! about time. my kids and I fight over who gets to play it lol and now they can play with me!
A136X70Y888XUR B0088QGB7Y 4 1342742400 30 fun game but be careful...its easy to accidentally buy smuef berries.. kind of like farmville (similar in that you grow crops) but you have lots of cute quests to complete
A136X70Y888XUR B00HHBXYGM 4 1391040000 27 Great shooting game. Very addicting. Don't forget if you need coins you can go back and replay easier levels to earn more coins. Gets harder and harder...
A136XAQQCG9YMP B00BG3ID0Y 5 1374451200 21 This Game Is Byfar The most Good Game I Haev Ever Played In My entire Life!! Everyone should have his game!!

A136XAQQCG9YMP B00BPC23XO 5 1371686400 20 lol this game is pretty darn cool. i love it. u will too!  try this game out because it rocks!
A136XAQQCG9YMP B00FXKHEK6 5 1385596800 27 This game is fun for all ages. It is a fun, somewhat complicated, and it will keep you occupied for a long time. This game is outstanding.
A136XAQQCG9YMP B00CRLSN4U 5 1372377600 25 This Is A Good App And I think That Every Body Should Get This Ao that it Can Be The Bezt App In The world
A136XAQQCG9YMP B00DFW3818 5 1374451200 27 A Fun game that includes amazing hits from the past few years. This game is fun and challenging at the same time. Everyone SHOULD Have this game.
A1373S8CPLZNJZ B00FXKHEK6 5 1384214400 25 It is really cool and I love how you can have fun and guess. I also like how u get guess s to help u
A1373S8CPLZNJZ B00CZDSK7K 5 1405728000 48 if you want to earn some money take your person to the career area they work at and praise them 3 times and keep dragging them back and repeat it for 20 times or more and you will get promotions and money faster. NO LIES TRY IT NOW
A1373S8CPLZNJZ B00G5LQ5MU 5 1387324800 23 I like this game but one part is very hard I wish I could figure it out well anyways fun game I guess
A1373S8CPLZNJZ B007L3M1W4 2 1365292800 25 It freezes and you have to restart it if you want to change your look it freezes. That's why I just practice on my grandma.
A1375J4MOETZPX B0073LWEXK 1 1359417600 87 After starting this game over for the fifth time, I am about to throw it away. It freezes if you take too long on the symbol puzzle and when i finally got all the symbols in the right spot, nothing opened or clicked. I could only do spring and winter. No hints helped and there was nothing else to do. Tapping every single inch on each screen hoping to find something!, i am not playing anymore  until reviews are stating that problems are fixed. Very frustrating  indeed.
A1375J4MOETZPX B007MPJQ38 5 1377475200 20 I am new to games but i am enjoying these mystery type puzzles. I hope there are more to come.
A1375J4MOETZPX B00881VLCE 5 1399161600 35 I really like all the beautiful pictures used in the puzzles. I was surprised and happy that you can change categories for a while. I think most people will enjoy playing it. Great colors also.
A1375J4MOETZPX B00H1TX87A 4 1390348800 43 This is a simple game to play if you have already played the escape room games. I have not finished yet so it might get harder towards the end. I do not think that the review should be offered before the game ends.
A1375J4MOETZPX B005Z4BGY0 5 1342137600 23 loved the game. i could never get the game to complete itself. would like to see it completely developed and would purchase it.
A1375J4MOETZPX B00HCMG6LG 5 1387411200 26 It is a fun puzzle game and great solving problems. The game is interesting but the music annoying with the same tune playing over and over.
A1377SNAXAR3JV B007AJU2MK 5 1332374400 20 i get angry at my brothers sometimes and i want to break there face. but this helped me a lot.
A1377SNAXAR3JV B007MFDUP8 1 1332288000 38 I'm sorry people that i didn't listen to your review i shouldve bcuz it is THE WORST GAME IN THE HISTORY OF OUTERSPACE. IT WONT LET ME EVM GO IN A FLIPPIN CHAT ROMM YOU DUMB BUNNY RABITS
A1378ZJMWCTVT3 B00A4EZ3QS 3 1364169600 25 Too easy for an adult, but maybe ok for a smallish child. I just wish you could have an option of turning off the sound
A1378ZJMWCTVT3 B00FYHXMQS 4 1386892800 25 A LOT OF FUN. CHALLENGING AND DOABLE AT THE SAME TIME. AND FREE, WHAT CAN BE BETTER THAN THAT? WISH THEY HAD MORE LIKE THIS
A1378ZJMWCTVT3 B00BFUUMO8 1 1364169600 30 Kept giving me some error code. My son was so dissappointed. Looked like a fun game that refused to function! If I actually paid for it I would be FURIOUS.
A1378ZJMWCTVT3 B00GH6HTEG 2 1387152000 54 I just could not get into it. The voice is very soothing and the words are meaningful and pleasant but I guess every meditation is not for everyone. But it was free and I will try it again several times just to make sure it does not work for me before I delete it.
A1378ZJMWCTVT3 B00GDADUPS 4 1389225600 36 I got stuck on a level and no matter what I do I cannot get out of it. But I enjoy playing it occasionally when I feel the need to feel bad about my mental capacity.
A137AIEN2FOYNE B00I8Q77Y0 4 1403827200 30 This game is fun but you can get really mad at this game because sometimes it can get really annoying. It still is a pretty fun game to play sometimes.
A137AIEN2FOYNE B00DJFIMW6 4 1403827200 26 If you have watched Despicable Me this is the game for you. It has all the elements of the movie and is very fun to play.
A137B7KTPAFGSQ B00IH5UZ1E 5 1402185600 29 This game is really challenging.  Some people might even say that its addicting but that's a good thing so you don't give up. jk.  This gave sucks you ca
A137E12T6T1K0J B0063IH60K 4 1387152000 56 It sure is a lot better solitaire game than the solitaire app that I first put on my Kindle Fire.  I only wish that it would give the option of playing more than one solitaire game.  Currently it is only the 7 up solitaire.  And one other think, it has way to many commercial ad breaks.
A137E12T6T1K0J B004FRX0MY 5 1389571200 77 This is a must have if you want to download music on your Android device.  To my surprise, after I got the Amazon MP3 app, I was able to easily get my Amazon Cloud on my device and therefore listen to all of the music that I had already downloaded for another device.  It's easy to use and if you like music, Amazon is one of the best sources to find just about any MP3 you want.
A137E12T6T1K0J B009ZZDNT6 5 1362355200 54 I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire.  I was a little nervous since I wasn't sure if it would work and needed, for sure, to be woke up at a certain time.  However, the app worked great, was easy to set up, and I was able to be up and ready on time.
A137E12T6T1K0J B0054JZC6E 3 1396310400 21 This is for some people, but not for me.  It strings me out to play games like these, very fast paced.
A137E12T6T1K0J B00AFCEIB0 4 1383004800 28 I'm so used to using Google for my searches.  I'm sure that Bing is also a very good search tool, but Google is definitely a plus to have.
A137E12T6T1K0J B005KC664W 4 1363737600 44 I love doing the Sudoku game in the daily paper and when I found this app, I knew I had to have it, especially since it's free.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it can be addicting.
A137E12T6T1K0J B007ZE34FM 5 1386892800 48 This is a great app if you want to listen to most any music, You can do a search via artist and listen to a complete albums of that artist. I like this mostly to decide if I want to download a certain song or an entire album.
A137E12T6T1K0J B0063GSL60 5 1327190400 21 You have to be careful not to get addicted because freecell is just that, providing hours of entertainment and simple fun.
A137E12T6T1K0J B009HHX414 5 1396310400 56 This is really a great app if you don't have a smartphone or if you are on a limit of how many texts you can send with your smartphone.  There is no charge to text with this app and it's easy to setup.  Since I got my smartphone with unlimited everything, I use that to text.
A137E12T6T1K0J B00E46D1QQ 3 1383004800 47 This little free app is not quite what I thought it would be.  I downloaded it because I love Disney characters, but that doesn't quite cut it as it is not nearly as loved by me as the Disney characters.  It has been deleted from my Kindle.
A137E12T6T1K0J B008DYK0I2 2 1383004800 21 I never could get the Watch ESPN to work right for me on my Kindle.  Therefore, it's gone from my Kindle.
A137E12T6T1K0J B0065AFQSU 2 1383004800 39 This is probably a good App for someone who is looking for what it says it is (ESPN Scores), but I thought I was getting something more, and this was of no use to me.  Gone from my Kindle.
A137E12T6T1K0J B005ZISF8Q 5 1396310400 51 Better Homes and Garden magazine sent me a deal for a two year subscription and I have to say that I am not disappointed with the magazine.  It has great color scheme ideas, decorating ideas and some pretty good recipes.  So, I got the app for my Android device.  Love it!
A137IWJMQOJGUO B00FX6ZBXC 5 1392595200 23 If you like word games you will like this game.You  can play this game with the whole family.You can play with multiple players.
A137IWJMQOJGUO B00DZJ4O2S 5 1392768000 41 This game is a blast. It will challenge your mind and it will have you guessing. It's a game that the whole family can play. The kids will enjoy this game as well. You will really have to know your brands.
A137IWJMQOJGUO B00F24OV8G 5 1392595200 20 This game is a blast.It will have you guessing on some logos. It challenges you and makes you really think.
A137IWJMQOJGUO B00FCYEZOQ 5 1392595200 23 This is fun game for all ages.It's a game the whole family can join in.You will have a blast with the whole family.
A137M646T86D5L B005CKNPAK 4 1355529600 32 I got this game for my daughter to play, but I've played it a few times, it's fun but it should have more stuff to do for the baby, and more games.
A137M646T86D5L B008V06NRU 5 1355529600 20 Lots of fun, It's like having a pet that has to be taken care of, and it's a great deal.
A137M646T86D5L B004GVV4T0 1 1355529600 20 Did'nt care for it, it was to hard to play, I thought it was more like tetrus, but It wasn't.
A137M646T86D5L B008D29K7G 1 1355529600 25 Doesn't give much news. I expected to be able to get more imformation from this App, it just took up space on my Kindle fire.
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B00D2XD5JU 5 1371945600 20 Once I started playing, I could not stop!. This game is fun when your trying to get through the day!.
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B00DVKOYBM 5 1383436800 21 I love to play pool?,  and when I'm not doing my favorite pass time,  this helps out a lot.Thnx a lot!
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B00E8KLWB4 4 1393372800 45 I have a hard time letting go of this game!. I like the story line and different game with the same back ground. My only. dislike is some of the objects are small and difficult to find! all other aspects of the game is fun!!!!!
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B00KOEHQCW 5 1402185600 29 Its about time!  I loved the movie and I cant thank you enough for getting it on the awesome kindle fire app. Many thanks come your WAY!  P.S.  BRAVO!!!!!!
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B00FX6ZBXC 5 1389398400 20 My wife fell in love with this game! she cant stop playing it all night? YES shes that GOOOD!!!!!! XO
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B00FAPF5U0 5 1382227200 29 When I found that candy crush was on the kindle fire?,  I was excited!. I have a problem doing other things that I should be doing, like house work!
A137Q3Y5AF1KWX B005DSLRDS 4 1364083200 32 This apt is so fun to play with and you can make ring tones for you contacts. There are sons buttons I would not let my kids hear but all else Good
A137RZ2TOPRP1Z B007PT3QOQ 1 1334102400 22 This app won't load on the kindle fire. Sticks at the loading screen.  Thankfully the app was free. I would not rrcommend.
A137SUBHRMCA7C B00998UF9U 4 1372464000 34 The only thing that doesn't work for me is the kind of game it is, you run out of energy, you need money, you need gold coins but other than that, this game's okay
A137SUBHRMCA7C B0054JZC6E 4 1368489600 37 This app is fun I really like it and my nephews an nieces really like it too. It passes time like if your at the doctors office or just waiting for something it also relieves stress somehow
A137SUBHRMCA7C B007KPOZK4 4 1373068800 57 This game is awesome I really like it but I don't like that your energy runs out, that you have to collect stars and stuff and if you don't have enough there is no point in playing the game. Besides that I love the idea of stardom makes it seem really easy to become a movie star.
A137SUBHRMCA7C B008RA3X5E 5 1366761600 76 This app is totally what you need if you need a nice lullaby to put you to sleep or a nice loud song to wake you up. This app has its own songs for you to wake up to but you can use your own songs if you want. I like that it tells me how many hours I have to sleep when I set the alarm. Somehow I always only have 6 hours to sleep....
A137SUBHRMCA7C B00C7TAF3Y 5 1368835200 39 You want this game because it well worth the 1.99 and its fun and full of curiosity and puzzle solving. The Room will have you begging for more which is why I wish it'd be a little more longer
A137SUBHRMCA7C B00B2V66VS 5 1376179200 58 I really adore this game, it is such an improvement to number 1 more graphics, more  opportunities to earn coins, characters are more  3Dish, there are crazy awesome obstacles and a whole new board to run away from the huge gorilla monster! And it is FREE so there is not a reason to pass by this superterrificawsome game!
A137VB6YX5K2AP B00AK2RHR2 5 1359417600 39 I love these cooking dash/dinner dash games. Lots of fun. I was a little sad to see that my purchase only came with 5 restaurants. I have to pay more to unlock more. I am tempted. Not sure yet.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B00881VLCE 5 1386460800 20 Great puzzle game. Easy to do and lots of puzzles to choose from. Love this game. Good for kids too.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B008DWM0QY 4 1358640000 32 I love these kind of games. A good mystery with puzzles. I just can't afford the full version. With a free download just as long as you do not expect to finish.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B00CWY76CC 5 1377734400 27 I am enjoying this game a lot. The levels are somewhat challenging, but not too hard. It's free so not loss if you do not like it.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B0097EWK3A 5 1357776000 22 Very fun seek and find game with a mystery to solve. You have to find clues and do puzzles to move forward.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B004HGK6FW 5 1358294400 20 Fun game that works great and helps keep your mind sharp. No issues at all! Love it! Thank you! :)
A137VB6YX5K2AP B0067QCC70 5 1356566400 21 I am enjoying the game so far. It is pretty much a hidden objects game. It also has a story line.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B0094BB4TW 1 1356480000 39 The Facebook app Kindle Fire sucks! I am having the same problem as so many others. The app only shows the first ten or so posts and then it stops. What is the point? Just access through the web.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B00AA87JGU 5 1359849600 33 So far I am enjoying the game. Great graphics and fun escape games. I am not fond of having to buy coins to play certain levels, but it is worth a download. Enjoy.
A137VB6YX5K2AP B00DRPVE3M 4 1394323200 34 Uno is a fun game. I love the app. Worth a download since it is free. I gave it four stars because I do not like the feature of having to wait to play.
A137W48G9MB9CV B008D2QRAO 1 1356307200 57 It starts out fun.  lots of bonus rounds, winning and all that.  After you gain a few levels it tapers off and turns into every other boring slot game.  Rarely a bonus round,  low winnings and waiting for more coins in an hour.  Surely there are fun slot games out there but this one is not it.
A137W48G9MB9CV B006PH7WBM 1 1355788800 88 The game was fine,  fun even.  But if you play it on a kindle fire you get updated last if at all.  Its one week before Christmas and still no update,  goals, items for the holidays.  Meanwhile my neighbors have all of that.  I admit ive spent money on this and other TL games but I am not spending a dime more and may even quit.  They don't seem to care about ALL of their customers.  Its just not right.  ill find other games to play.  Goodbye FS.
A137W48G9MB9CV B008OOYALE 5 1352332800 21 Fun to play.  I like being surprised at what is going to be hatched.  Just don't like the long wait times.
A137W48G9MB9CV B006VW94HQ 5 1343520000 24 Play one or play ten.  Fun easy to play but also makes you think.  Worth the 99 cents if you're a word game lover.
A137W48G9MB9CV B008NCUFYS 5 1350604800 53 Got a spare few moments?  Play Paplinko and watch time fly by!  Not a lot of skill needed although Ive found you can somewhat &quot;direct &quot; the balls by dropping them on a certain side.  The challenges make it more fun by having small goals.  Get this game and become addicted like me!
A137W48G9MB9CV B008Y2FRFO 5 1350518400 76 A fun time waster.  Yes it is free and yes you can buy coins but in the higher levels its easier to get free coins.  Its very addictive even though there isn't a real point.  If you play the game at carnivals you will love it.  You'll regent coins faster if you leave the game on.  I just plug in my kindle and leave it on and I get coins super fast.  Give it a try!
A137W48G9MB9CV B00A13BI7U 4 1354838400 28 Love the game but its very glitchy and force closes a lot on my Kindle.  Makes it frustrating to enjoy having to restart the game over and over.
A137WC0JSLE916 B00975HIYU 1 1394409600 30 Completely uninteresting.Run out of coins quickly and can't get any more for free for 4 hours. I uninstalled it. Too many great games out there to play a boring one.
A137WC0JSLE916 B00E0NVX4U 4 1402790400 31 It is good, but road trip 2 is much better. I did them in the reverse so this one seems simpler. I recommend it for people who like hidden object games.
A137WC0JSLE916 B006MI4JEM 5 1367712000 29 Terrific game. It is similar to boggle with a bit of scrabble mixed in, but I like it a little better. Play this game more than all the others.
A137WC0JSLE916 B00CWY76CC 4 1371254400 47 Takes a little bit to catch on, can get complex. Need to really pay attention to every little thing. I liked it. You might want to get a pen &amp; paper to help you remember some of the codes so you don't have to keep going back.
A137WC0JSLE916 B00B03IY90 5 1371427200 63 Totally fun and frustrating at the same time. I am on level 3. It is complicated sometimes to find everything you need, but totally exciting when you finally find it. I recommend for patient people only, who have a lot of time on their hands. This is not like most of the hidden object apps. Go for it &amp; give it a try.
A137WC0JSLE916 B008N3TLNI 4 1367712000 35 This game is just like Yahtzee. The ads are irritating, but it was free. I can play with my sister on line. I had to go thru Facebook, which I hated. It works just fine.
A137WC0JSLE916 B0063GSL60 5 1366588800 39 Works great. Love the game. Like that you can just  tap and the game moves the cards for you (occasionally to the wrong stack, but that is easily corrected). Would recommend this. The ads are irritating, but it's free.
A137WC0JSLE916 B0084HDG8Y 5 1383955200 22 The graphics are excellent. Each game is challenging and truly realistic. Great variety of pinball machines. I am addicted. I highly recommend.
A137XEE3MV19XB B00D3MWW44 5 1383782400 37 I love this game. if you love dolphins, you will to. You get to do tricks and shows and you can even customize your dolphin. This is a game that you can't put down it's so good
A137XEE3MV19XB B004RJMUJO 3 1340236800 24 I think its kinda lameit should actually have ninjas in itif I were you I'd buy it but not play it all the time
A137XEE3MV19XB B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366243200 24 this app is pretty sweet but you have to like keep buying hints and stuff. which is kinda annoying. I would probably recommend it.
A137XEE3MV19XB B0071PARPA 5 1342569600 27 I love this app!!!!!!I like to draw,and I'm on my kindle like 24.7so I use it a lot!! and it helps me to get better at drawing!
A137XEE3MV19XB B005UOK2KY 1 1340236800 25 don't buy it if your life depended on itwhen they named it annoying orangethey ment ityoutube was bad enoughbut a Tv show and now this
A137XEE3MV19XB B00DUZKE4O 5 1377129600 29 I love love this game. It's really fun. I like how they have movie and animated. Some times it can be a little hard like on the higher levels.
A137XEE3MV19XB B0086700CM 5 1340236800 23 I love temple runbut I think they should have more stuff you can buybest game I ownand they. should. make stuff last longer
A137XEE3MV19XB B00CZDSK7K 5 1371427200 44 I love this app. It's very fun for all ages. You get to make a family, and watch them grow up. You tell them if they are doing something good or bad. You can decorate and remodel your house, and have generation of family.
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B0076POKVC 1 1342483200 28 Sadly, this is a very boring game with almost no challenge. Gameplay, graphics, and much of the dialogue are all weak. I do not recommend purchasing this game.
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B009DCOU9S 3 1376092800 148 Overall, the gameplay is very weak. For the most part it will require a fair amount of somewhat random tapping to solve the hidden object puzzles. There is little guidance, and plenty of solutions can't really be discovered with logic. For example, you may find a magical staff to use in a puzzle, but not know what it does or when to use it.If you are only interested in this app for the gaming element you will almost certainly grow bored of it before finishing the game. Fortunately, the story element is a bit stronger than the gameplay, so if you take time to read the dialogue or listen to the full-script voiceovers you might stick with it long enough to finish. Its &quot;OK&quot;, but unless you've already played all of the best this genre has to offer, there's plenty of similar titles that are far more entertaining.
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B008BMNGD2 5 1344038400 29 Very fun game to explore. Thoroughly enjoyed the playthrough. Great graphics and puzzles, the story was fun (and a bit hokey), and kept me up late more than once.
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B0058VW36U 5 1338508800 37 Absolutely love this game! Very fun -- couldn't stop until I beat every level with 3 stars... the new levels they added for free after I purchased the app was a nice plus too. Get this game!
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B0074AKEDC 3 1338163200 320 The game itself is OK... the hidden object formula is pretty simple and nothing Alawar Entertainment hasn't already done many times.  My complaint about it is the large number of objects that are hidden to be invisible. They take an item and cut it up into tiny, unrecognizable pieces, and then overlay them onto backgrounds that hide them very well.  Sometimes they even colorize the object so that it blends into the background.  Where's the fun in that? Anybody can photoshop a tiny piece of an item, color match it, and make it hard to find in a picture... it's fun when you know if you look long enough you'll actually find it.  I hate using hints, so I try to never do it, but some objects were so invisible that even after using a hint I'm staring right at the spot it highlighted and I still can't see it... so I tap there anyway and the item seems to appear out of nowhere.  Very frustrating.Other than the cheap hiding method, the story is laughably poorly done. Not only is the dialogue incredibly weak, it's also self-contradicting... like when the girlfriend teases the boyfriend about believing in legends:(paraphrasing)Her: You don't believe in all that talk about the legend, do you?Him: With all the weird stuff that's happened on this island, it's hard not to believe it![He tells the legend of the island]Him: I have a really hard time believing in stories like that.Her: I don't know, I just have this feeling that it's all true!Wait... I thought she was the skeptic and he was the believer... then he tells the story and now he's doubting it and she's convinced it's real?  Haha!Really, the only thing driving this game other than the HO scenes is the story, and the only thing that makes it stand out from the dozens of other HO games is the story... this one is REALLY weak.
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B006D1ONE4 5 1344556800 73 Assumed the cutesy cartoon-style game by Disney with little rubber duckies had to be for kids, but it stuck on the top apps list for so long I eventually had to check it out. I loved it instantly! Very enjoyable and unique puzzle game with lots of great content, impressive physics, and good variety in the levels. If you like puzzle games like Cut the Rope, you should already be downloading this game!
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B008245WE0 1 1345420800 60 Don't bother buying this app. I think other reviewers have covered it pretty well -- the app is far too annoying for a paid app, and really, it even pushes it if it was a free app. I really enjoy white noise while sleeping, and have purchased a half-dozen of them, but this one is my least favorite to use.
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B007ZD17XO 5 1340323200 61 This is a quality game, and definitely one of the best match-3/jewel games I've ever played. Very fun gameplay that always makes me want to play one more round.  Earning stars to level up special powers is a lot of fun, and the continuous addition and evolution of those abilities keep the game interesting as you progress further in.  Love it!
A137Z5P4WSXVUN B008Z666Q8 5 1347753600 270 Absolutely love this game!  Many games like this force you to buy their in-game currency or suffer through a painfully tedious grind to earn more money so you can unlock power-ups, etc.  Skylanders has enjoyable gameplay that doesn't feel like a pointless and repetitive grind just to upgrade your gear or purchase the next power-up.  There are a wide variety of levels that are randomized each time you play, with each level getting progressively harder the further in to the game you get.Playing through the game will always earn you more coins, these are used to upgrade any special abilities you have already unlocked.  Every day the element of the day changes, if you play with a Skylander character whose elemental alignment matches the element of the day you will earn a 50% bonus to the coins you collect for each run.  Although you need gems to unlock these other Skylanders, your can earn a lot of gems at a decent pace by shooting the floating presents during the game, and for completing the various objectives that help you level up.  There are a ton of Skylanders to unlock, each with their own look and special ability that you'll enjoy working towards unlocking.The "grind" for gems and coins in fun and the time spent in the game feels purposeful and rewarding.  It's an easy game to recommend and will appeal to plenty of gamers -- if you think it looks like your kind of game, you're probably right.  The price is well worth the value of this game.--------------Please click "Yes" if this information helped you learn more about this game.
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B005ZY5U2E 5 1326585600 31 I downloaded this for my Fire and I have a blast playing it!  It has beautiful color, and is a pretty relaxed game to play.  I've played it a hundred times!
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B0063GORYU 5 1326585600 34 Loved this game on my computer, and I am glad to have it on my Kindle Fire.  I haven't had any problems working with a smaller screen.  Great addition to my app family :)
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B0067Q4PQQ 4 1326585600 48 I fell in LOVE with this game!  It is similar to Diner Dash, fun, fast, making food.  However, this is the trial version and you only get to play to a certain level.  It's over too soon, but it just may convince me to buy the full version.
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B005HSL626 4 1326585600 62 Fruit Ninja is a blast to play, although it can get a little old after a while.  This is one of those games I like to keep on my Kindle for just for a little relaxation play.  I love the Zen mode, because you can play with a short time and no bombs (i.e. you can't die).  Beautiful colors on the Fire!
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B004O3YGMC 2 1326585600 74 I fell in love with the idea of this app, and downloaded it when it was the app of the day.  My major complaint is that you cannot access your computer when it is shut down.  For me, I always have my laptop on sleep, therefore I can't access it when I am on the go with my fire.  This is the first app of this kind I've had and I learned my lesson.
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B004Q3CJQ0 5 1326585600 59 Works great as a little flashlight when you need it in the dark.. just be careful not to shine it in your eyes!  There are a couple extra features like a yellow flashing light, a blue/red/white police lights, etc.  The other options are sort of useless, except for to toy with for a bit.  The flashlight works great though!
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B00ALKKM98 5 1356825600 73 The original Flow Free is one of my favorite games.  Its not too terribly challenging, but it makes you feel good when you complete the puzzle.  The bridge adds a new dimension.  In each puzzle, there is one bridge in which one pipe can go over and one pipe can go under.I think the bridge actually gives you an advantage (cues you in to where you should be going), but its fun nonetheless.
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B008245WE0 3 1356825600 29 This app is relaxing, and it is sort of fun to toy with the different modes on here, but there aren't very many variables..and it gets boring real easy.
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B006ZMEI3W 5 1330732800 56 Can't say enough about how much I love this game.  Great controls, nice upgrades, keeps you entertained.  Doesn't get boring with all the upgrades and keeps you on your toes with bonuses and extra customer waves! If you like Diner Dash, Cake Mania, and other time management games, you'll LOVE Supermarket Mania.  Totally worth the price!
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B006C1DH92 4 1326585600 62 I got this for free when it was the App of the Day.  I like the original Fruit Ninja, and the biggest difference with this game is there is a mode you can play several different mini games following the same principle: slice the fruit.  It is fun because the mini games are different just about every time.  It has excellent replay-ability.
A137ZHXJ9I4DEX B004V5PW4Y 5 1356825600 88 I love Farkle, and this app makes it easy to play on the go.  The app is smooth, I've had no bugs and the best part is you don't have to add your own points ;)I also highly enjoy the fact that you can toggle the rules.  There are many different rule variations to Farkle (how many points to get on the board, how many to win, how many points a flush is, etc), and you can just about adjust the game to how your used to playing.
A13815N2TNWNNQ B005LY4B0A 5 1319673600 27 Got this app a while ago as the FAOTD and have enjoyed playing it everyday.  Similar to cut the rope fun using a turn based game play.
A13815N2TNWNNQ B00820STKI 5 1340236800 34 This app was the FAOTD several days ago and my whole family has played with it.  The colors and rendering is great, and the games are enjoyable also.  Well done app with no problems.
A13815N2TNWNNQ B004U75OYG 4 1326585600 22 As a kid we had the plastic pegs Super Mastermind and I loved it.  Same layout, rules and fun that I remember.
A138420BCWCYPB B006OC2ANS 3 1330732800 20 Good gameplay, good graphics, some annoying of glitches. I wish it was great, but for free you should not complain.
A138420BCWCYPB B007JPG04E 3 1332201600 39 so the game is making me write this review so I can get in game credits.  But even then you have to spend real money to get enough in game credits for it to be a really fun game.
A1385EU8VXNY92 B004YXE438 4 1312675200 61 great app only way it can be better is if we were able to add photos to use instead of only having the preset ones . But as far as the app goes it is great and you can go easy to hard per puzzle game. As others have said great time killer and great way to keep your mind thinking.
A1385EU8VXNY92 B004MC8CA2 5 1341532800 26 this is a great app to help keep on track and getting a daily reading plan. also great for quick scripture look up. would highly recommend.
A1386VK4UQ2MEU B009G9KFQ0 5 1376179200 60 I deleted a different app after using weatherbug for a while .It was so much easier to use.The whole app is easy to switch from one to another using the icons and I get live video from the weather web cams along the roads everywhere. The alerts are great as I fish from an aluminum boat up in the mountains.
A1386VK4UQ2MEU B006PJ3UKC 4 1362873600 28 I look forward to reading this with my morning cup,it's fast easy and I recently found the political cartoons.This is a great app,I recommend this to all !!
A1387JZ2US1ZVF B004SJ3BCI 5 1326585600 34 That's all fabulous, as simple as that. Great to kill time or whatever. Love it, kids at age 5 like my little sister and up could play it along with a 90 year old
A1387JZ2US1ZVF B008Y7SMQU 3 1351382400 24 love 99&cent; more awesome get it great for free no wick needed hi hi hi hi hi hi hi just want my free hints
A1387JZ2US1ZVF B006PH7WBM 5 1331424000 22 super awesome I love it you NEED to download it it will blow you away teamlava has really out done them selfs
A1387JZ2US1ZVF B006OC2ANS 4 1331596800 22 This is a great game and a lot of fun! The only draw back is it requires money to complete the tournaments.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B00I5UHKPA 5 1392940800 23 I really enjoyed this game. The graphics were really good. I would like to see the sequel. Thank you for an enjoyable pastime.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B00J206J5E 5 1396483200 35 I am enjoying the game of In between Land very much. It seems to me to be a game for older kids or adults.  It has a lot of strategy and deep thinking to it.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B00FN7K8Z2 5 1397001600 23 I love this game. I love animals and this game shows how not to treat animals.  It also shows how intelligent they are.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B00II5YUIW 5 1401235200 20 Really enjoyed this game.  I would like to see more games of this type. Graphics were really excellent and defined.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B00HDPT2RM 5 1400803200 22 Graphics are wonderful. Game is very good.  Fun to play. I have always loved hidden object games. Please get more like this.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B00B4VI8MQ 4 1396915200 24 I liked this game okay.  I have played better games. I still liked the hidden object puzzles. It could have been made much better.
A138AV8KM3EZRZ B0084DYNGC 5 1395964800 24 Amazon is amazing! I am really enjoying the game.  I have always liked hidden object games. The Kindle versions are easy to work with.
A138BZ0ASOB0J1 B00EEDJHXA 5 1404259200 17 We love this game, its harder for the youngest grandchild, but the others have fun with it.
A138BZ0ASOB0J1 B00EEDJM2Q 5 1404259200 15 All of us love to play this game, even my 4 year old grand daughter.
A138BZ0ASOB0J1 B00ATSAVQG 1 1404259200 8 The grandkids didn't like the game at all.
A138BZ0ASOB0J1 B00E0NVX4U 1 1404259200 5 Didn't like it at all.
A138BZ0ASOB0J1 B00IKZX1ZI 5 1404259200 15 Grandkids love this app, even the little one  (age 4) could play it without help.
A138CMOHPTI00Y B006OBWGHO 4 1355443200 51 I liked the app it is fun and kinda challenging I also thought it was funny how the alligator would make a face.  one bad thing is you don't get that many places to play and they are always advertising the none free appother than that I say get the app
A138CMOHPTI00Y B0086700CM 5 1353542400 28 this is such a great game I am so addicted I can never get bored you should really try it out the objectives go from easy to hard
A138CMOHPTI00Y B0064X7FVE 5 1355443200 54 I liked this app for in the mornings to see the temp outside and I also loved that you could get 36 hour or 10day you could also get severe weather alerted it is awesome and no purchase I recomend this app for others it is very quick to load so get the app
A138CMOHPTI00Y B008CG839O 1 1352332800 47 I tried this game on my kindle fire. It worked great for the first few levels and then it crashed. Luckily it did not crash my whole kindle. do not get this game or it will mess up your device. it did that to my sister's.  Beware!
A138CMOHPTI00Y B008JGSM6G 4 1355011200 107 The good thing about this game is that it does not have any bugs or glitches. The levels are challenging but doable, and I like that you can skip levels if you are stuck on one. The only thing that i do not like is that you only get 3 hints. I wish that you could get more hints instead of having to buy them. Here's a warning, use your hints wisely if you are not planning to buy any more than the three they give you.All in all, it's a pretty good game though. I would have given it 5 stars if there were more hint.
A138CMOHPTI00Y B0063IH60K 4 1355443200 40 I like this app one of the first I got you can play by yourself or with another person pretty fun. if you don't know.what to do and want something you dont have to think about this is the game
A138EGGPMM8JKT B004N8KDNY 5 1329004800 39 It is a good game and it works on my Kindle Fire just fine. If you have problems with an application, reboot your device and try again before you start sharing negative comments about the application or the device.
A138EGGPMM8JKT B006GG1KOC 5 1326326400 53 My 3 year-old really likes this game. It makes him think and also gives me the opportunity to improve his vocabulary by engaging him in a discussion about each screen. I ask him to explain his choice before he taps on a picture. BTW, the app is working perfectly on the Kindle Fire.
A138EGGPMM8JKT B0054JZC6E 5 1329091200 62 I downloaded it when it was the free app of the day, but was reluctant to apply updates until now. Looks like the bug has been fixed, because my points and games survived the update. Some of the games are hard or too fast, but there are so many of them that I can quickly find another one that fits me better.
A138EXAXLZPWLU B00CZDSK7K 5 1380412800 32 It is a really great casual game. You don't have to spend actual money to achieve anything but can, if you're super impatient.  I'm sure that I will continue to play on.
A138EXAXLZPWLU B00CEVALHA 5 1377734400 31 It is a cute and fun game. Graphics are well done and you don't have to spend a lot of actual money to get anywhere In the game...at least so far.
A138EXAXLZPWLU B009HKL4B8 4 1350604800 33 It is quite cool on my kindle fire. love the graphics. does take a while to build up life points but what else do you expect. they want you to pay for something.
A138EXAXLZPWLU B007PT3QOQ 5 1333843200 21 it keeps you on your toes. yes the energy seems to run out quickly but at least it builds back up.
A138EXAXLZPWLU B007P6T52G 5 1338595200 25 does take a long time to advance if you don't have totems but it helps with boredom times. hopefully you're ready to spend dome cash.
A138EXAXLZPWLU B00C5J4MO4 5 1376870400 21 Really having fun playing this. Challenging and fun at the same time just like actual mini golf. Love it. Really cool
A138EXAXLZPWLU B0080IOHLW 2 1339804800 22 it restarted my game like 3 times, so I uninstalled. I actually spent money on this game so that further agitated me.
A138G4YW2J7X8R B00G5LQ5MU 4 1397174400 58 Bush is a sweetheart and if referred by sugar levels it is a fat and if your not pretty nobody likes of me to voice their own movie and I need to get more stupid stunts and if referred by sugar and if your best bet is the best friend of the world and it is really a
A138G4YW2J7X8R B00DTQZ7E6 2 1373932800 86 I played it a few times and its really getting boring you choose the color of the foot then you wash the foot dry it and then you get to take the old nail polish off with nail polish remover you clip the nails and then you paint the nails then you pick out the damsel and that's really all their is to it so if you like those kinds of games go ahead and get it but I really don't like it...and its really stupid
A138G4YW2J7X8R B00D8RM75I 5 1371600000 105 I just started playing this game. I just can't do this week and if you don't have to make music with them you should be cheating on the dark knight and if you don't have to make music with them you should be cheating on the dark knight and if you don't have to make music with them you should be cheating on the dark knight and if you don't have to make music with them you should be cheating on the dark knight and if you don't have to make music with them you should be cheating on the dark knight and if you
A138K5OYOD15EM B007PT3QOQ 1 1334361600 35 I was excited to try this app as I like Oregon Trail games. The app never connected to the Internet. I would try several times and even though I had wi-fi, it never cooperated. Uninstalled.
A138K5OYOD15EM B0053TKBMU 5 1330128000 28 This really helps me to sleep. When I am stressed, I use it to help me calm down and relax. This app is-without a doubt- a worthwhile investment.
A138K5OYOD15EM B0063IH60K 5 1330128000 32 I love how I can personalize the backs of the cards and the overall background. There are many different kinds of game deals you can play. This is a great time passer.
A138K5OYOD15EM B004JZBGWI 5 1330128000 42 There is great use in this app. I find it easy to organize my thoughts and plans but still be able to keep them under a password setting. It can even be used as a diary. The calender is a help too.
A138K5OYOD15EM B0064DBE9I 2 1330128000 43 I am not a big fan of this app. The piano has either a too slow or too quick reaction time. There is only one octave which makes it difficult to use. This app is more worth it to younger kids than musicians.
A138K5OYOD15EM B005KCQZ2K 4 1327017600 35 I really like the game. It is addicting, but also there is a downfall. You do have to use real money if you want some of the better equitment. Other than that, it is great!
A138K5OYOD15EM B005UQ9FNC 4 1333411200 45 Very fun cute app but when I was on level 28, it crashed and I haven't been able to get back on. I had to delete it. Just beware of the crashes. Even if you are in a good Wi-Fi spot, it may not connect.
A138K5OYOD15EM B006GWE5PM 5 1330128000 24 Great on my Kindle Fire, although it can take a while to load on occasion. This game is fun and a great time passer.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B00FIW5BZE 5 1392163200 29 I love this game. I have always enjoyed MOHJONG, but other appsfroze up, ugly tiles, or just plain boring.This app is clear, fun, quick, and has NOT frozen up.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B009UWME8U 1 1392076800 20 Kinda fun at first, but you only get ONE letter to get word.  Come on. I TIRED of it quickly.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B00H42WDAC 5 1401667200 23 Love it, fun, colorful, merry!!  Enjoy the different activities it offers. App is very good, unlike PUZZLEBOSS, which I removed all of them.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B00GI8AMI8 1 1404950400 6 Did not like it. deleted it.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B009ZXRC9A 4 1392854400 38 My grandsons 6 and almost 8 love it. It's creeping (good creepy) and moves along quickly. They get solo into it trying to get all the ants. They really get excited and make me laugh. Fun, fun game.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B008RMEGXA 1 1392854400 48 I got the app, because it said FREE. However, it was not free, all the app. Gave was a limited time view, and then YOU PAID for it. I don't like sneaky claims. Got rid of it. This has happened with other so called FREE apps. Not nice.
A138KJFRD71WD5 B007VU3R5C 5 1392854400 37 MY VERY BEST GAME.I play this and card game all the time. Lots of designs to pick from, so there is no chance of getting bored.I have been playing Mohjong for years, this one of the best.
A138MH76RUAZB0 B005T87QCI 5 1350604800 21 Very COOL! SUPER FUN! I was amazed at the amazing moves each bot has. Very fun! I highly recommend this game.
A138MH76RUAZB0 B008X8QCTO 1 1352246400 22 I paid money to get this dumb game and when I made it so far it wants me to pay more!? RIPOFF!!!!!!
A138MH76RUAZB0 B00992CF6W 5 1362182400 20 It isn't as good as the computer version because the area is small... BUT THIS IS AWESOME! Worth every penny!
A138MH76RUAZB0 B009UX2YAC 5 1358121600 27 I don't say this about many apps... but this is one of the best apps to play when you're bored. Especially for free! I recommend this app.
A138MH76RUAZB0 B00FT8FRO2 1 1383350400 24 It's a lame ripoff of minecraft. Even though it's free it's just a waste. This is just my opinion - you might like it.
A138MH76RUAZB0 B008GXHOFW 2 1354579200 23 Wow. Waste of money! Graphics are okay... Combat is lame!! Voicing is retarded. I'm glad I got it when it was only 99c.
A138MH76RUAZB0 B00FRQ32N4 5 1383609600 23 Seriously better than the first one! Tons more robots and upgrades! And it's all free!!! Tons of awesome stuff and an amazing deal!
A138MH76RUAZB0 B008NABUU8 1 1351036800 22 It was fun until it jammed my kindle. I wasn't able to turn it on. Don't get it! It's not worth it.
A138ND2OX3HF24 B00HIFVID8 5 1389657600 41 THIS IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND RELAXING. MY 87 YEAR OLD MOTHER CAN NOT SIT AT THE COMPUTER TO PLAY, BUT WITH THE KINDLE SHE CAN SET IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER, SOLITAIRE IS HER FAVORITE GAME. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE.
A138ND2OX3HF24 B00975HIYU 5 1392249600 38 THIS ONE IS SO MUCH FUN AND YOU CAN SWITCH GAMES AND KEEP PLAYING YOUR SO BANK ROLE. I RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO A L L THE PEOPLE STUCK INSIDE BECUASE OF THE WEATHER. GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY.
A138O3NQND9M15 B00CAK052Q 4 1383782400 24 I like this game because I never expected it to be so awesome and cool one of my favorite trucks is the blue one
A138O3NQND9M15 B004SJ3AXI 5 1372032000 32 it is a very awesome game I like it when the do it by year like 2013 and new seasons every year so I would get this game if I were you

A138O3NQND9M15 B0067VKQLE 5 1382227200 27 if anyone is looking for a challenge download this game because the last level is very hard but I felt proud when I finished the whole game!
A138O3NQND9M15 B004VMTI42 5 1396396800 24 there are loads of funny to educational shows like youtube loop or car wrecks there is also a program where you can watch cartoons.
A138QFAT5BMPEV B009ZXT4BY 2 1392249600 49 How the ****** do u get food?????? I keep getting eaten by a lion,bear,or wolf!!!!!! It keeps saying ' you are slightly hungry'. WELL HOW DO U GET FOOD, BUILD A SHELTER, OR PROTECT YOURSELF????!!!!!!!! If a could I will give it 0 stars!!! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!
A138S163J3G9ND B0091REZMW 5 1351123200 22 fun to play once you get the hang of it. sometimes to short a play.  other times realy long. would recommend it.
A138S163J3G9ND B00BNH1PF8 5 1362873600 22 always a chalenge love it. sometimes the pictures are a little off from the answer but all around a very good game
A138S163J3G9ND B00933JL0A 5 1392768000 28 love playing this game i downloaded it about two days ago and i cant stop playing it. so far nothing bugs me while playing. would recommend to friends.
A138WT147W0NIG B004SJ3AXI 5 1356220800 42 Loved what I played before and wouldn't expect any less from this game - I'll keep playing as long as I can.  A bit addicting, I have trouble turning it off and getting things done that I'm supposed to be doing!!  LOL
A138WT147W0NIG B0063M22QO 5 1376006400 69 I love playing this game.  Lots of different puzzles to choose from.  Play challenge mode and the more you play there the more puzzles open up for you to play.  Works great on Kindle Fire HD, no problems there.  If you like Mahjong games, this is a must have game.  Great for when you have 10 - 15 minutes to play or hours to waste, it's an awesome game.
A138WT147W0NIG B00CDV6WDS 5 1376006400 57 This is a mahjong game you want to play, if you like these kinds of games, you will enjoy this one for sure.  Works great on my kindle fire hd, no problems running and lots of designs to chose from to play.  Never heard of the maker (Pozirk), but will watch for more from this company again!!
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00E7SFAAG 5 1381104000 22 This is on fun program, there a bunch of great levels that are a blast. I rate this program with 5 stars.
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00A3WTXQ2 5 1356825600 25 My 8 year old granddaughter loves this game, she does not have any problems with it a day plays it for hours at a time.
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00EW3STPY 5 1381104000 31 I bought this program because my grandson who is 4 loves caillou, he wanted me to find a jigsaw puzzle that he could play and with three levels he loves it.
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00A3E2BVE 5 1356825600 20 Enjoying my wife and friends play this game for hours at a time, and it ls  lot of fun :-)
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00881VLCE 4 1341792000 36 I liked this app better on the iPad, the prices looked more like puzzle pieces look better but the game play is still the same sand is a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game.
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00E1LILWI 5 1393372800 21 This is a fun safe app for the kids, they use it all of the time. I highly recommend this app.
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00F8GYC1Y 5 1404777600 28 As with all of the Angry Bird Applications by Rovio is very fun and exciting to play and would recommend all of them to anybody young or old.
A138Z79GXVI1UW B00IF2JW8G 5 1395705600 20 This is a dun fast game that my 10 year old granddaughters really like. l would recommend it to anybody'
A138ZZL7OZVR9U B00HGJ18C2 4 1405123200 12 super fast, but too many commercial ads and sometimes slow to undo.
A138ZZL7OZVR9U B00FIW5BZE 5 1401148800 40 i like the style of the disappearing squares.  i don't like having to be on the web to play the game.  But enjoy the 2nd chance i get when i run out of matches.  it downloads easily and doesn't crash.
A1390NEE2GFK1Y B006OC2ANS 5 1330387200 20 I recommend this game! Great graphics! Fun game with cool levels!! It's definitely a winner, especially for a free game!
A1390NEE2GFK1Y B007NACZPI 4 1332720000 37 This game is definitely fun to play! The only drawback is that you have to purchase more crystals and coins to continue to play after the first day or so. More of the options should be free.
A1390NEE2GFK1Y B007SYWFRM 5 1335744000 26 This game is a lot of fun and it can be addictive.  I haven't had any issues with after figuring out how to exit the game!
A1392L64M35EQ4 B009T8XBBO 2 1369872000 25 Some parts were too short.  some were too easy.  This was kind of boring for my age group.  would be better for 8-10 year olds.
A1392L64M35EQ4 B009ZZDNT6 5 1369872000 23 easy to set and use.  Easy to see with just waking up.  Have to remember to reset if you don't use it daily.
A1393MECQZBA91 B009HKL4B8 5 1380326400 68 This game is definitely rated a five!! So many things to explore and I just started but I've played before. If you have never played this game you should really get it. It's really addicting and fun. Is is also VERY VERY VERY VERY cheap .last time I played it was on a friend's phone and she bought it for $6.99. VERY CHEAP!!!! It's awesome that it's FREE!!!
A1393MECQZBA91 B0061SLW7A 5 1383264000 35 I absolutely love this so no lie!!!!! You should at least try it out!!!! Have fun and don't forget to tell her your name and she will call you by it.nobody will regret this app.
A1393MECQZBA91 B009T6IV02 1 1402531200 23 There is no way to win! It's very disappointing because every time, I die! They should actually be able to let you win!
A1395JC11R0WX B00AOA9BL0 5 1397174400 28 This app works great on my Kindle Fire and my Apple iPod. I can't believe it is FREE. When was anything ever FREE on Comcast? Definitely 5 Stars.
A1395JC11R0WX B004J1DBJI 5 1330300800 39 I no sooner downloaded the Wolfram app to my Kindle Fire, then asked a question about Meryl Streep (it was just after the Oscar presentation), and the app had her third Oscar listed for Iron Lady. Now, that's fast.
A1395JC11R0WX B004TBM4VY 4 1323648000 22 Fun &amp; challenging. Not designed like typical newspaper/mag puzzle, but still fun. Definitely worth the small cost. Good buy for the money.
A1395JC11R0WX B00A701GSS 5 1396656000 47 There are only a couple of places left in America to turn for real news. One of the best is definitely NPR! I have NPR set on my alarm clock radio, my bathroom radio, my kitchen radio, my car radio . . . you get the idea.
A1396KK8YE9D1I B007TXUZ1U 4 1359244800 24 I think this game would be better if you could have more than one baby,but other than that the game is great.Keep it up.
A1396KK8YE9D1I B00AMPGY7G 5 1364515200 165 I love this app . I love  this app because, It's just like Pinterest but better . It's better because , you can have different &quot; collections&quot;  and when you save stuff to your collections it tells you how much it is and gives you a link to were you can purchase it .  You can search almost anything . You can also follow your friends and anyone that you think has cool products ( what you save ) . You can search a bunch of  different things and follow a bunch of stores. You can search from candy and chocolate to Disney stuff animals . Anyone who likes to shop should get this app . If you follow your family members and friends you can get ideas for what you can get them for a special occasion or holiday. Please get this app and pass it on to anyone else who you know. Please check out my page . My name is jamp021.- jamp021
A1399H2GOYRYZA B0094BB4TW 5 1401494400 64 This is the best way for me to keep up with family members since people are so mobile these days. Since the military provides computer access to soldiers overseas, I was abel to join the rest of the family in keeping in touch with members who are away by using this app on my Kindle while I was on vacation.  It worked really great.
A1399H2GOYRYZA B00I0WIUHK 5 1401321600 22 I like the slidedown when a match of three is done .  Payoffs are low but the game is fun and interesting.
A1399H2GOYRYZA B00ELV0WF2 5 1401494400 49 This game is very difficult to win. That is why it has become my favorite card game. When I do win I know it was my skills (and luck) that resulted in winning. Once you win, the game challenges you with a new level. Not for people easily frustrated.
A1399H2GOYRYZA B009ZZDNT6 5 1401494400 36 I used this clock while on vacation.  Very visible at night.  The best feature is the large selection of ringtones.  You can set an alarm for weekdays and a second alarm for weekends. Very cool feature!
A1399S35U40EA8 B00F8L2VO4 1 1395100800 51 I downI downloaded this game and usedplayed it.

A1399S35U40EA8 B00BUQBQN8 3 1395100800 34 I look at this sight every once in a while.  Lots of stuff on this sight seem very homeade and not very well homeade, but they do have some very nice and pretty things.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00514DIE0 3 1395100800 27 I like this type game.  I enjoyed playing it.  I think this is a great take me away type game.  Makes you forget about everything around you.
A1399S35U40EA8 B007A6K2GY 1 1395100800 20 Downloaded this game, but it wasn't what I was looking for so I uninstalled and never played this game. Thanks.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00D1DL0IE 2 1395100800 26 This was a fun game.  There were a lot of other country logos that I had no idea what they were, so I had to cheat.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00COCTAZS 3 1395100800 21 I love slot machines.  I play lots of slot games and this one didn't disappoint me.  Thank you for your product.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00AQL8VU4 5 1395100800 23 Love this application.  So easy to access and nice to have at the tip of your finger when I have my tablet operating.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00CELIPL4 1 1395100800 21 I down loaded this and It was not what I expected it to be, so I uninstalled it and never played.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00GP0G0IK 1 1395100800 20 This was too complicated I didn't care for this game.  It was not what I was looking for to play.
A1399S35U40EA8 B009HUB40Y 3 1395100800 23 I really like playing match 3 games they are a great way to pass the time when bored.  Fun and exciting to play.

A1399S35U40EA8 B00C2YR3XE 2 1395100800 23 I really like playing Hidden Object games they are a great way to pass the time when bored.  Fun and exciting to play.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00CJ77HU8 3 1395100800 22 This was a fun game.  I enjoyed playing and just played so much I was ready to move on to something else.
A1399S35U40EA8 B004HGK6FW 1 1395100800 27 I downloaded this game and never played it.  It was not what I was expecting, so I uninstalled the app. It was okay, just not for me.
A1399S35U40EA8 B00FEIX5OG 3 1395100800 22 I really like playing match 3 they are a great way to pass the time when bored.  Fun and exciting to play.
A1399S35U40EA8 B005TB7TRC 3 1395100800 26 I love playing slots.  Sometimes I like to play, just before taking a trip to a casino to play for real. It gets me pumped up.
A139AGDN1CV3BZ B00FAPF5U0 5 1388966400 22 It's fun to play with it. I would like to have more time on the game before it runs out of time.
A139AGDN1CV3BZ B0063IH60K 5 1356652800 30 My husband likes to play this game alot so do I like it.So we both play it at the same time me on my kindle and he on the computor.
A139AGDN1CV3BZ B00A9JG6RS 4 1356652800 20 I put this on my kindle so my grand kids would have a game to play. I like it too
A139AJOP2KXWM B007P6T52G 5 1338595200 20 not bad. could b a lil more. weeds keep growing to fast ...  over all you desire for itself. hjfu
A139AJOP2KXWM B0087HEQ6M 4 1339200000 31 a lil slow but its going good. they don't ask u to always to purchase credits they actually allow u too earn them. I like this game nit passes the time.
A139AJOP2KXWM B007ZGO7EM 5 1357344000 20 I like it. it has all the functions that are needed and more. plan but good. good job divitalchemy, llc
A139AJOP2KXWM B00BW08XRO 5 1385510400 38 very fun and entertaining... pass down time very quickly. not bad at all. they even have a two now. like the intro story... putting lettuce n ketchup on things. ate a little hard but cant always be easy.
A139AJOP2KXWM B006E51AZY 5 1326153600 22 didn't think would. like it this much. its a nice mangagement game. seem to be always playing this game in free time.
A139CZ9R3ZB7O5 B00IINPXLW 5 1401148800 19 If you loved the original Cut the Rope - you will love this version.Kids love it!!  Great game play.
A139E3SWZN10TS B004ZALKMI 3 1357257600 25 It would be nice if it let me record my voiceso that the game would be better. Don't ono why it wont let me record.

A139E3SWZN10TS B00AREIAI8 5 1378512000 20 this is one of the coolists games ever!!!you should try it to you never know you mite like it to
A139E3SWZN10TS B00C7TAF3Y 5 1367539200 43 This app is worth the price. I love this type of puzzle game. The graphics are good. This game stands out from a lot of the others. Once I started playing was hard to stop. One of the best apps I have purchased.
A139ERFHMIYLXL B009AEIMWA 5 1389657600 24 Best night of sleep I have had. Different rain sounds. Relaxing. If, you enjoy sleeping when it rains,, this is the app for you.
A139GN6GS0A2UQ B00AW3FDIO 5 1368921600 42 I had an extremely fun time playing this game. The controls are a little hard to get use to but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy to play I love zombie games and found this game very entertaining.
A139GN6GS0A2UQ B00AKJTBL0 5 1361318400 33 I have completely enjoyed playing this game the graphics are awesome and the hidden object areas are quite fun keep up the good work! I will be looking forward to more from BIG!
A139K7V6YN5QY8 B00BJA2VFW 5 1377561600 41 I like games that offer mindless play.  Sort of like &#34;take me away calgon&#34; type of games LOL.  Seriously though, it's like a lot of other games in type, but has an added bonus of some graphics that appeal to me.
A139K7V6YN5QY8 B00A9JG6RS 2 1358726400 64 after first game - fun! - each time I tried to access the game I got info for tournament (of no interest to me) ... and finally got to the game again by accident. apparently, cuz I've been unable to do it again:(  I like games I can just relax and have a good time playing. not ones which add to stress and frustration.
A139K7V6YN5QY8 B00BQ2OX86 3 1369699200 27 I'm used to doing the puzzle thing complete with table and chair, so thought I'd try the &#34;virtual&#34; puzzle world.  May take some getting used to :)
A139K7V6YN5QY8 B007BH7T90 4 1377561600 22 I like the options for the type of tiles.  It's hard for me to recognize the oriental letters. It's a fun game
A139K7V6YN5QY8 B009EEFTMC 5 1363305600 59 This game is positively addicting.  I like Majong but I LOVE CUBISTRY!!! The colors are intense and the 3D effects are wonderful. In Majong, you just match blocks, but in this game, you can rotate the cube and actually look into the cube to match designs. I've already shown lots of my friends and they are hooked also :)
A139K7V6YN5QY8 B00CXPO0BU 4 1377561600 23 I like the game, but am having trouble figuring out one level.  Sort of got stuck LOL. Am still working on it however.
A139KPRMV3AOWC B005HSL626 5 1363564800 23 Well designed with good graphics and fun upgrades to change the style of blade you slice the fruit with. Are you a NINJA?
A139KPRMV3AOWC B00E3OUQ5S 4 1381104000 32 Fun game with upgrade able weapons and player vs player shooting battles.  I don't like the gun and reloading on the same side of the screen due to it slowing me down.
A139KPRMV3AOWC B0086700CM 5 1363564800 24 This is a fun game that has good graphics and has extra stuff you can buy the more coins you collect during the game.
A139KPRMV3AOWC B00529IOXO 5 1363564800 37 Most the time you will either here a sound or it will pop up on your screen when you are on another app you can text anyone that can recieve texts and you can recieve texts back.
A139KPRMV3AOWC B005ZXWMUS 5 1363564800 24 It is a helpful app being able to watch Netflix movies and Tv shows where ever you are as long as you have wifi.
A139RTLXRQIFX6 B00AREIAI8 5 1361664000 20 It's great. I love to care for a virtual pet, plus my little cousin loves to pet it.I love it.
A139RTLXRQIFX6 B00D8RM75I 5 1390176000 86 This game is really great. I've never really stuck these kinds of management games, but this game just blew me away.Pros:-Diamonds are earned by quests, coins are earned by collecting from buildings-The quests are really straightforward, and there is even a button that shows you what to do.Cons:-You only earn one diamond per quest (except for the one about writing a review, shock is 3)-I cannot seem to &quot;follow&quot; people unless I have their name or code.If these get fixed, I'd definitely give this 5 stars.Ciao.
A139RTLXRQIFX6 B009LTL906 2 1390003200 64 I was hoping the app would be about actually playing football, but sadly it bored me to death. All you really do (as far as I know) is customize your players and, well, watch a virtual game. I guess someone would enjoy that, but not me. You may ask why I gave three stars then, well, it's because somebody else may enjoy it more.
A139U57J0UV180 B0066T8SDU 3 1386374400 22 This app freezes at least once per game &amp; the kindle has to be restarted each time. Other than that it's excellent.
A139U57J0UV180 B005J80RTW 5 1376438400 20 I play this almost every day. Considering that it's free, the ads aren't obnoxious or obtrusive at all. Great app.
A139U57J0UV180 B00E83G68K 3 1381708800 72 This app is really cute and fun, and the music is great. But just watch out, because you can find yourself dropping quite a bit of cash on those stupid diamonds. And I also don't much like the Harv-e thing. If you don't use hundreds of diamonds to buy characters, you're stuck waiting for the thing to decide to give you the character, going through endless digitizations of ones you already have.
A139UMAD8P05HH B007SYWFRM 5 1334448000 25 this game is very fun. it is very addicting.you make families and play mini games too.To get out of the game you go to settings.
A139UMAD8P05HH B006OC2ANS 5 1331596800 22 this game is very fun. I think its cool that you can buy weapons and armour and you can doge attacks too.
A139UMAD8P05HH B008G0K9OS 4 1343952000 22 there are so many guns and the controls are good. the survival is very fun and make sure to buy some grenades.
A139UMAD8P05HH B006ON41FC 5 1329609600 34 this game is very addicting. when I first started playing I was attached. the only thing I didn't like was that it forces you to rate the game but other than that its fun
A139UMAD8P05HH B008171UVM 5 1338336000 26 This game is very simple and very addicting. add me. I like how you get to have your own mob and that you can rob people
A139W3UJHT75OS B007ZE34FM 2 1349654400 48 I used to love this app then it just stoped working. It said&quot;problem:46&quot; how am I suppost to know what that means? And u have to buy a seperate music player to play the music. It sucks! I don't recomend this app unroll it has some work done.
A139W3UJHT75OS B0071PARPA 4 1332201600 31 people can be good very very very very very good artist. I love this app so so so so so so so so so much it makes me express my self.
A139W3UJHT75OS B007XKEY6Q 1 1335571200 21 it will not let me get on I hate it very very very very very very very very very very much
A139ZZAS7RPHGL B005J0VPNC 1 1318118400 53 I don't quite understand what the point of the paper thing is. If you get rid of that, this is just $2 camera that can't really do anything. It would have been unique if you could put your pictures in a paper-type frame, like the one that is used to take the picture.
A139ZZAS7RPHGL B004L07KWQ 5 1318550400 59 This app is one of the coolest free app of the day apps I've downloaded. The multi-touch function of it is completely amazing and allows for some really intense effects. I don't even have kids and I am definitely going to keep this installed and mess around with it regularly. It could do with an erase all button though.
A139ZZAS7RPHGL B004XNGKBS 1 1317081600 55 Wow. This app is absolutely terrible. I don't see how anyone could ever stand using this for more than drawing pictures that even a preschooler could put to shame. The idea for something like this for a phone is a bad idea in the first place, because it just won't work, as demonstrated by Handrite.
A13A0VMNSRM3CL B007SXGTH0 1 1383350400 31 It sucks. All you can do is make 3!!! Notes. It is not worth a thing without the full version. I ended up deleting it. DON'T BUY IT!!!! I'm warning you.
A13A0VMNSRM3CL B004GMJKTK 4 1379116800 22 I love checkers, but they should make the computer less smart. The thing is a genius! All in all, a good app.
A13A0VMNSRM3CL B00EDF43MY 5 1379116800 31 This game is so good for little kids. I got this game on the day it was free, and the full version was the best. A must get for little kids.
A13A0VMNSRM3CL B00BJCLUXO 5 1383350400 24 Wow!!!!!!!! This is a SUPER fun game!!!! Love it!! :) Do not believe the reviews that say that it sucks. This app RULES!!!Best ever!
A13A8HHWODEH1X B00AEL7M7E 5 1359072000 23 This game is really good. Very fun and challenging. It tells a great story and has a lot of different levels. Very nice
A13A8HHWODEH1X B004SZ1U66 5 1342828800 36 This app has to honestly be the best app I've ever seen.  It's so affordable &amp; the possibilities are endless. I absolutely love it. I've had hours of fun. Definitely worth downloading. You won't regret it.
A13A8HHWODEH1X B0086700CM 5 1339200000 21 I love love love this game. I am soooooooooooo addicted to it. It's like a new game every time you play.
A13A8HHWODEH1X B008Y2FRFO 5 1348358400 25 Very fun game. So addictive. Unfortunately you have buy more coins when you run out. They're reasonably. priced but you go through coins pretty quickly.
A13A96AXSW69N B00G6CFW9K 1 1388361600 22 I thought this game would be fun. But it would not load on my Kindle. It sounds like a good war game.
A13A96AXSW69N B00EBQRSTK 5 1379376000 26 This is a great game to pass the time with. It keeps you engaged and wanting to see what the next puzzle is going to be.
A13A9PQP5HHEMO B00IKZX1ZI 5 1395705600 25 the kids loved the graphics and music and they are always fighting over who will go next.  they love the app, and so do I.
A13A9PQP5HHEMO B00881VLCE 5 1395446400 24 I just got the app;love it so far.I like the fact that I can save and go back,as well as change level of difficulty.
A13ACE911Y1QGB B00IKZX1ZI 4 1399075200 82 I really like Frozen, and have replaced my Candy Crush obsession.  Frozen has clever special blocks and boards, and the graphics are lovely.For some reason, at level 104 or so, the game froze up, gave me a few bizarre puzzles where the laws of physics seemed suspended, and then deleted all my power ups.  Now I realize I didn't pay for them, but I do use them occasionally.  Is this a glitch or did I just get a ghost in my machine?
A13ACE911Y1QGB B00J3YLQF2 4 1399507200 24 I like this game.  You have to be patient, but it's nice not have to worry about ick.  My cats love the zoom mode.
A13ACE911Y1QGB B004XNGKBS 3 1391558400 74 I admit i am comparing two different apps.  I suppose for a handwriting app this does a good enough job.  You can set it to post word by word or at the end of a line, or manually.  I really don't like how it requires you to write in a field rather than anywhere on the page.  It is probably the best handwriting app out there for Android, but I hope that changes soon.
A13ACE911Y1QGB B00E8KLWB4 4 1401062400 42 This is a fun hidden object game.  I haven't spent anything and I have really enjoyed it.  Very creative and tough as well.  I do wish there was more energy to begin with but I am working up to more by leveling.
A13ADEF6ENN0OK B00A1SL8SE 5 1359849600 67 I have really enjoyed playing this game. I always play without sound so I can't comment on that. As far as the play, I found it to be pretty cool, challenging and I like the graphics. The levels offer different features to outsmart. Most games look like cartoons and I haven't played any that look like this. Can't wait to see what the new levels look like.
A13ADEF6ENN0OK B0089336YM 3 1355011200 21 I enjoy listening but only get large town nearby. I hope they add more smaller police departments so it's more local.
A13ADEF6ENN0OK B00E616R5Q 5 1385942400 20 This game offers lots of free coins, great graphics, and if you hit it big, payoffs are in the millions.
A13ADEF6ENN0OK B00HYL0AAI 4 1400112000 30 I like this game. There are several different games within the app. The payouts are decent and as you play, you earn coins for the next time you log in.
A13ADEF6ENN0OK B007ZGO7EM 5 1356998400 21 I like this calculator. The numbers are big, it's simple and handy to have on my Kindle. I recommend it highly.
A13AG7Z9YV320I B00AECGQF2 5 1358121600 47 My 4 year old daughter loves this app.  I paid $2.99 for it but it was worth it.  She has so much fun styling the character's hair!  I like the addition of the curling irons and GROW solution.  I find myself playing it with her at times.
A13AH3KABZ9ABA B0086700CM 5 1338595200 42 This game is like possibly my favorite game ever. I love this game on my friends iphone and I have been waiting for this game to come out on the kindle fire. its even funner on the kindle fire!  a great buy.
A13AH3KABZ9ABA B005KN4PEE 1 1333843200 52 I tried this app on my mom first (she barely has a phone as it is a phone that u can only call on. it didn't work at all. Then I tried it on my little brother who's 7. he thought I &quot;wanted him to play too.&quot; bottom line is horrible app.
A13AH3KABZ9ABA B008Y7SMQU 4 1351468800 24 This is a very good app, but it makes you have to spell the logo name exactly right. That is pretty annoying. Otherwise good.
A13AIW3HBLX0NU B0067Q42BY 5 1378166400 22 this is alot of fun it has classic way and puzzle way this is so much fun you loose track of time!
A13AIW3HBLX0NU B009UWL580 4 1377302400 40 this dtarted out fun for me but now my friends daughters are all over it! they have enjoyed the puzzle the most! they cant wait to find the pieces and then put it together just to see the other puzzles!
A13AIW3HBLX0NU B00E5GJ7QS 4 1377302400 26 this is a fun game with the different levels and rewards! so far i have tried 3 online bingos and this one i like the most!
A13AIW3HBLX0NU B00CJ95O2E 4 1378425600 40 so far this program has been working great in saving my battery life!  it tells u when u low and how to prolong the life on low! it tells u what is running and needs to shut down to help!
A13AJM9OWWYXJJ B00BMNM4H6 2 1379808000 20 I thought this game would be fun but it's boring and did not enthuse me at all. Do not recommend
A13AJM9OWWYXJJ B00A6F6DIW 2 1397520000 24 Starts easy but as you move on to other levels, it's quite tangled and has no help or hints to help. Not too entertaining.
A13AJM9OWWYXJJ B00G4NUQYM 3 1393027200 35 I like this game and it's entertaining, however, it sometimes gets hard to guess the answer with the so many group of letters from which to choose.  In addition, you have to pay for hints.
A13AN46ZWEMVBP B004T68X4Q 5 1360454400 21 I got hooked on this game on my daughter-in-laws Kindle, so when I got my Kindle I ordered it for me.
A13AUA2C7UU5CE B009UX2YAC 4 1371513600 21 It's fun but it's hard to urn a lot of coins and no one wants to spend real money on coins
A13AUA2C7UU5CE B00CB4ET0K 5 1372204800 31 It's awesome but when you go through the minefield  if your playing on a kindle fire HD sideways you click on the menu Button and I don't likeThat it's auto move
A13AUA2C7UU5CE B00I8Q77Y0 4 1393545600 20 The whole point of this game is to be addictingand it is so I just want all the color birds
A13AUA2C7UU5CE B00DHQHQCE 5 1387238400 89 Most of the reason I'm typing this is for free quicksilver but it really is a good game and is easy to learn. I see how people could give bad ratings but most of the bad ratings I've seen on other games are because it can't download or it freezes, well most of the time ITS THE DEVICE not the game so next time don't download the games or apps u don't need and stop blaming the game unless it positively, or if other people are having that problem.
A13B4TFBM7TSAT B00F8L2VO4 4 1401580800 31 It is a great product.  I have used Rosetta stone before and I think I am learning more with this app.  I have it both on my computer and my phone.
A13B4TFBM7TSAT B00AA87JGU 3 1370822400 36 A good game that isn't too challenging or easy.  It is annoying that you have to pay for some levels, but so far you still have enough levels to make downloading the free app worth it.
A13B64NK9QD7ID B00992CF6W 5 1369958400 23 It is a good wait to buy and a good thing good game you can fly two and seats are endless supply chain
A13B64NK9QD7ID B00A6W03Z4 5 1369958400 26 It's fast and takes time but not 3 days 1 day only because of how the game works for other  things it may take 2 days
A13B64NK9QD7ID B00CTXY8RC 5 1371340800 31 But buildyourownland is a fin l q cell phones are  it ft free Integrator function of gun McDonald's o.intsgram the first to comment by the first place of the first place
A13B65CGJNVRH0 B005T87QCI 3 1346544000 56 the game isn't fair I keep ln pressing the buttons but then when on metro his health barely any any mine about half he does rip and beats me every fudgin time and I wish they didn't have rip off cuz wen I try to do it it does a upercut in.  stead so not fair
A13B790NJXBEBZ B0054JZC6E 4 1393977600 30 it is a really good game but the only problem is that the prices go up on the games but u get paid less points for the game u play
A13B790NJXBEBZ B00DJYC55C 1 1393977600 38 if you have a kindle fire forget this app I tried to download it and It kept on saying this is incompadable with ur divide and all of others say it is not worth it (and its not)
A13B790NJXBEBZ B00846GKTW 5 1375920000 24 challenging but way fun if it was easy it would be boring but this game is ama&agrave;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing play it noooooow &amp; I say woooooooooooooooooooooooooooow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A13B790NJXBEBZ B009UX2YAC 5 1388707200 63 In this game you run and dodge object and also collect coins u use coins to buy different players and different designed hoverboards and every month they change the theme and have limited timed new drained and people but collect tons of money because most stuff is fifty thousand coins but coins are pretty easy to gain and you also have daily challenges
A13B790NJXBEBZ B00B49Z8TY 5 1372118400 33 this is so fun I am a fashion freak so if you love fashion get this and also try style me girl if you already tried style me girl get this noooooooooow! now!
A13B85HRYERCJM B0087HT36U 4 1347753600 26 nice but takes the idea of angry birds. Rovio might need to sue miniclip.com for sure. the only thing that sets it apart is the angle.
A13B85HRYERCJM B009NG7R3K 3 1356048000 25 This game is even though better than temple run, but it glitches and also costs. I just call it even between the temple run games.
A13B85HRYERCJM B004DPIEF6 5 1351036800 76 This is awesome. ghosts are real. the last words it gave me were; hurried, Columbus, New York, directly, and audience. I was standing next to an Adam Dunn poster (white sox) and if you haven't noticed, those words fit in perfectly. even though Adam Dunn isn't dead, it could have also been another baseball player or someone related to him. This Is Real. don't believe the bad reveiws. Wait hang on, new words; look, up, danger....AAAAAAHHHHHHH!
A13B85HRYERCJM B00A1SL8SE 3 1358553600 23 its ok but its really hard. can anybody tell me the answer to level 1-23.and 2-3. for some reason, I cant pass them.
A13B85HRYERCJM B008Y2FRFO 5 1348185600 20 3d and free? a perfect connection of the two combined in one. one of the best games on the market.
A13B8QT9I6EGCA B00GNIJAEA 4 1391558400 57 I've been waiting to see what the rage about Bitstrips was. When it came to Kindle Fire, I was ecstatic. I've spent a crap load of time making comics. Very addictive. The only problem being sometimes comics fail to load, even with refreshing. Less likely to happen with a better connection. But still happens. Overall great fun.
A13B8QT9I6EGCA B007VUA7VO 5 1348790400 23 a great app that tells you how much battery life you have for different things. works well on kindle fire hd as well.
A13B8QT9I6EGCA B00AKEMHCA 5 1391558400 38 The already great game of Bloons Tower Defense is back with the latest installment. Works well on my Kindle Fire HD, got it when it was free. Otherwise would still be worth the money if I had it.
A13B96828GJEER B009G9KFQ0 5 1379548800 35 Comes in handy living in Florida's quick changing weather! We have horses and it is great to look up the weather to see if is going to be severe showers or a nice general rain!
A13BD25LG6UFDB B005ZXWMUS 4 1324771200 24 graphics are perfect if u let it load for atleast 45 seconds. just wait if ur graphics arnt good also perfect for the kindle
A13BD25LG6UFDB B007BPYCAG 5 1332633600 21 loads of fun.made a little.movie the entire family loves it so 5/5 stars for this fricken app!!!! Omg sumbit review already
A13BD25LG6UFDB B0064XT03U 4 1324512000 24 very good game perfect for.kindle happy it was only one dollar for all of this also it can last along time which is sick
A13BD25LG6UFDB B007JPG04E 1 1334448000 25 in order to be good at there games you have to pay so they make awesome games free but you gotta pay to play :)
A13BQPM78URBZ8 B00H343YNQ 4 1390176000 23 lots of color,  coins build up pretty fast.  Enjoyed the time I have played on it, Better  and  more fun then the casinoino
A13BQPM78URBZ8 B007TBAQCK 4 1392508800 39 I REALLY ENJOY PLAYING , Bonus games are fun and plentiful. and it has great graphics and seems to add up the coins very nicely. I can also use my computer or my kindle to play which is great.
A13BQPM78URBZ8 B00C7X0ZNU 1 1396915200 69 It really makes me mad that I can't download it on my kindle ...I used to spend hours playing and now I go from,  open Appstore to the app and when I push open. ....it goes right back to the open Appstore message!!!!!I haven't been able to play for over a week.  AND I WONDER WHERE ARE ALL MY POINTS THAT I BOUGHT AND THE OTHERS THAT I EARNED?????
A13BQPM78URBZ8 B00H2I9F4U 4 1393977600 39 Great graphics, coins are available quickly, I have it  on my kindle and on the computer and  sense I can't seem to link up with Facebook it's like two different games. My granddaughter loves to play the games ,
A13BS0RANB5ZEC B0075AJ3O2 5 1347408000 30 This is great if you are sick of the 10 images that come with your phone. I can switch as often as i want! There are tons of great pics.
A13BS0RANB5ZEC B006OCM13M 4 1370131200 32 This is fun really to play, but it is addictive. It actually seems to be taking over my life. I do wish the Team Lava would improve the way you invite &#34;neighbors&#34;.
A13BS0RANB5ZEC B006OCM0G0 4 1370131200 42 This is fun really to play, but it is addictive. It actually seems to be taking over my life, since i can't seem to cook enough food fast enough. I do wish the Team Lava would improve the way you invite &#34;neighbors&#34;.
A13BTFT4JX5IVY B00ESNW58K 4 1398902400 100 This game is super fun and I love it but....... to do most things in it, u have to wait a suuuuuuuuper long time. And the only way to skip through that time is too use ur crystals. Just u only get so many crystals and u can't Earn them or anything, u have to buy em with real money!! Plus the wait time can be up to an hour or two!! I know it sounds bad but the actual game is really REALLY fun!!! Love the game but creators can u make the crystals not such a big treasure??
A13BTFT4JX5IVY B00H2ZM1GC 5 1398297600 68 I play animal jam myself and I love it! I have always wanted a game made by the animal jam creators and when this came out, I just had to HAVE it!! And I'm glad I got it, it's an AMAZING game!!!!! Ppl who don't have it are missing out!!! Don't care aboutThe money, it's worth it! ( oh and if u play animal jam, I am glitter12676)
A13BTFT4JX5IVY B00JVZ0DQG 5 1404086400 41 I was waiting for a mobile farming app and this is definitely the one I've been waiting for! It's amazing and everything is so life like and wonderful!!! I love it! If u don't have ur missing out!!!!! Great job Zynga!!
A13BYQ2J11TOBB B006M4F67A 5 1387065600 24 Fun game full of in and outs. Any one will have a fun filled few hours of mind work and thinking your way around.
A13BYQ2J11TOBB B00FIW5BZE 5 1383523200 28 One of the best Monhjong games I have seen or played the HD is very nice. The choice of boards is very, very nice many to pick from.
A13BYQ2J11TOBB B00BX42FLY 3 1397520000 21 Good game but some of the pictures don't match each other other needed word. So it a little confusing at times.
A13BYQ2J11TOBB B00KGCNRAM 5 1401408000 31 A easy but fun game of mahjong. Hours of playing time with many puzzles to use. Any age can play and have hours of fun. Just ask my 7year old grandson.
A13BYQ2J11TOBB B008VAGGWM 5 1400457600 31 A game of skill and learning to go slow and easy!!!! Speed and you lose, fun and  entertaining. You can play it hour on end and still want more and more.
A13BYQ2J11TOBB B007GE0X3M 5 1382054400 26 A nice type of paper for those in a rush!!!! Good read for a small paper. All readers will get a lot out of the paper.
A13C33CDEGKNV3 B0086700CM 1 1358812800 21 temple run two will be on the appstore soon so just wait a while cg hvg gugyrtv ghdgst gftg. foxtrotting gvftdf
A13C33CDEGKNV3 B008IJTFYW 5 1343692800 22 this app is great for trying to fall asleep when people are snoring you can mix and match up to 10 sounds!
A13C3PG1TEBZYO B009ZKSPDK 5 1364428800 35 this game is awesome but I want to play with people is there a multliplayer (sorry might speller it wrong) I want to play with my friends so can you make an update with multlyplayer
A13C3PG1TEBZYO B00DEVQ0LA 2 1373587200 31 its a copy of where's my water and how is it better than minecraft p.s look at top paid but its a copy of where's my water who agrees to me
A13C3PG1TEBZYO B005T87QCI 5 1373673600 67 this game is very amazing it has good graphics and it is like the movie the only thing that is bad is that you need to buy other bots or build your own robot and gallery but it is very fun I look toward for more creative stuff like building your own world and build your own robot like the kind on xbox it is very fun
A13C3PG1TEBZYO B008841TP0 5 1352678400 25 this game is so cool when I first got it I thought it was the same as minecraft but not everything is blocks on it
A13C3PG1TEBZYO B009ZXT4BY 4 1372204800 22 the controlls are too hard and the crafting takes a while to get use to but still a fun game like minecraft
A13C6NTJ3HO0FX B009EEFTMC 5 1401062400 21 Review from my 11-year-old daughter: This is a 5 because it fools your brain, so it takes a lot of thinking.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B007SYAXIK 5 1353283200 24 This is a fun word association game. Not too easy, not too hard. Makes you think a bit. Good way to pass the time.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B006PKQQSE 4 1349222400 39 This is a good game of Spades. AI isn't perfect; computer partner doesn't always back up human partner and sometimes makes really stupid moves, but human partners make those same mistakes. All in all, a really solid Spades game.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B008194C74 5 1337904000 46 I love this game! Exactly zero permissions required, and it downloaded with 74 puzzles to solve initially. A new twist on word games, with excellent game play. Graphics work great on my Droid Razr. This is a keeper that will be my new go to game.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004TTMYQG 5 1310083200 45 I've tried other calendar apps, and this is by far the best. Developers keep improving it, too. Way better than the stock Android calendar. Syncs flawlessly with my Google calendar. While I got it for free, I would definitely pay $5 for it...it's worth it.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004Z92T9W 3 1314316800 71 This is a nice port of an old-school game. Fun to play; finger slide control worked smoothly. It does have some bugs to fix, though. Frog died for no reason after sitting on log for no more than 2 seconds, no where near edge of screen. Sound continued to play after backing out of game (no exit key) and app had to be forced closed manually to stop music. Droid X
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B006VW94HQ 5 1342828800 27 Fun word game with a bit different spin. Matching the word pairs isn't always easy, but they all eventually make sense. Not your same old word game.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004X7ZK3S 5 1305763200 35 Five stars for the funny developer review. Love that sense of humor! App is nice basic app for those who want to keep a handle on how deep a hole they're digging themselves into debt.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004TA2F14 4 1314576000 55 This is the best list app I've used, and I've tried several. Love the shopping lists. Can set up separate lists for different stores. The to do list function also works well. Lost everything when my phone crashed, and I was lost, so I'm going to buy the Pro version so that never happens again.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B0067R8JNK 5 1322438400 30 This is a fun, somewhat challenging word game. If you like Scrabble-like word games, this one is for you. It adds a twist to the usual timed Boggle style game.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B0087HT36U 5 1353888000 20 Not too hard, but still challenging. Fun diversion. I like it better than angry birds, because it's not as frustrating.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004SJ3204 5 1308960000 31 This is a good, basic cribbage game. AI is great. Sometimes I win and sometimes I lose. Have to keep on my toes and play well to win. Love this game!
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004YXE438 5 1312675200 49 This is a fun and addictive slider puzzle game. I like the ability to choose how many pieces and the level of difficulty for each puzzle. If I just want a quick and easy time killer, I can choose the easiest levels, but the harder challenges are there, too.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B004SYIA1U 5 1313107200 45 This is a great app! I love the old time radio shows. Easy to use; great for car trips. I do wish it would allow for downloads of complete programs, because one of my monthly trips takes me through an area with no cell reception.
A13C6V5VBNWG4P B005DO1N2W 5 1328745600 35 Nice app; cutesy icons for each sign. Pretty generic horoscopes, but nice. Fun if you like to read your horoscope every day. You can even set a reminder to read it each day. Droid X
A13C6ZAVQPEVUX B007VUCAVO 5 1354492800 30 it is a great app. my kindle sometimes has trouble charging so I'm not sure when it really is or not...but this app really tells me. I highly suggest it
A13C6ZAVQPEVUX B0066HA1A0 4 1327190400 34 same with up there its just looks so fun to play with it. Nsc shf shc shxsffshx sxb sfhdbxfhs fhsbcjsb bjsbsbxjsbchsbcjsc J's xjsshdjwhsubdjahahdjshs jsbsxjsbsdsj jbdsjbdjabd jxjababxkabx jbbsjxb b b b b b b b

A13C6ZAVQPEVUX B006U52MQY 4 1328659200 21 I love sunflat games. their so fun. blah bla bla bla bla bla bla bla f c d d d d
A13C7Q7CFGNY26 B00CQ9U1PW 5 1379980800 30 This game is truly amazing. I mostly did this review to get all the awesome updates. But besides the updates the game is a lot of fun. Definitely get it
A13C7Q7CFGNY26 B00E46SGYI 5 1378512000 25 This game has great graphics, really fun, and is addictive . I would recommend this game to any one it is a lot of fun.
A13C7Q7CFGNY26 B00C2AMWVG 1 1395446400 66 This game is extremely stupid, hard, and bad game play. When you first start singleplayer or multiplayer it is so hard to control the worm. This game is a turn based game and when its your turn you only have one shot and can't even aim. I don't understand why anyone would like a game that you can't control. 1 star in my opinion, bad game.
A13C7Q7CFGNY26 B00DYOOGYK 4 1405814400 99 This game is very fun and a good way yo waste time. But the games driving mechanics, lively hood of the world, and random encounters are not so good. Unlike its father gangstar rio city of saints which had plenty of these. All I ask for is a gangstar 5, a more immersive story, more missions, more people living in the world, and a multiplayer option. But besides these it is a very entertaining game, however it can get boring after the main story and the alien story lines. Thereby we need a multiplayer option to keep it rolling.
A13C7Q7CFGNY26 B00FATEJYE 1 1393027200 49 This game was flippin awesome until a couple days ago when the crappy update came and ruined everything. It won't even let me open it let alone play it. Fix the fricken game or I'll just delete the dang thing and keep writing bad reviews until its fixed. &gt;:)

A13C8VOGBCUEGD B008LG021M 5 1357516800 38 this game is so  awesome every one should try it thee is no other racing and shooting game. ndvdhjsvdbdbudosvkdsienmdnenhebd end. rjr nd dhjr grid hdnfjdj dfbdkd ofof d f f vhf db sud d jdhdi d djd bdjdh
A13C8YBKAVUI1Z B00CA3C1N4 4 1379635200 20 It's pretty, though not ground breaking in  any way.  Fun to play, and repetitively so.  Worth a buck.  Maybe two.
A13C8YBKAVUI1Z B008FC5APU 4 1377302400 22 A good, solid implementation of the classic game.  I'm not an expert player, so the computer opponents are plenty tough for me.
A13C8YBKAVUI1Z B00ELOOYZI 5 1386028800 30 What a great little educational game.  Simple engineering, design, testing, celestial mechanics... it's really cool.  Loses a little replayability after you make it to the moon, but that's a quibble.
A13C8YBKAVUI1Z B005XQLBU4 4 1384128000 25 Engaging fun!  Simple 2d effects mean it moves smoothly and plays like an old arcade game.  Not horribly deep, but good for a quick distraction.
A13C8YBKAVUI1Z B008S3EJSU 3 1396310400 21 Funny and entertaining for adults.  NOT for young children.  All the ladies in TBT land have all their stuff hangin' out.
A13CC7VE8PSE4N B004FRX0MY 5 1353801600 23 I love that I have this App. on several devises and I don't have to sit for hours trying to transfer my music!
A13CCGPKXCBIAG B0063GORYU 5 1370822400 33 I like to play this game just to relax and use up time. This version is very good. I like the fact you can just touch the screen to make the next move.
A13CDHRKPX35SJ B00KSOQ66K 3 1404864000 147 This is not a bad game.3 stars is just an average game.The graphics are pretty good on most of the games. BUT you either win big or you go back home. My suggestion is that you have a few good friends who are able to send you gifts.Because in my 22 level run it was them and only them that kept me from getting 2 or 3 spins and then having to wait until  the next bonus can around.&#34; Thanks Beth &#34; I couldn't find anything that brought out that &#34; Oh yea this is gonna be fun.&#34; In the end I found myself returning just to check out Elvira's cleavage.But then that was the only attracting quality of the game.It's only my opinion thou.You should just roll on.&#34; Never know you might just hit it rich &#34;.I just didn't have the incentive to keep on trying.&#34;
A13CDZIWCBKTGI B00FHYX6O6 5 1383523200 22 I have been waiting for a cookie clicker on kindle :) I am so excited its here plus it is free too
A13CDZIWCBKTGI B00DUGCLY4 4 1403740800 25 It's a good game but the only two flaws is some puzzles are too straight and the others are it gets to hard too fast
A13CDZIWCBKTGI B009UX2YAC 1 1384560000 20 You all know temple run yeah this is just another knockoff of the perfectly good temple run 1 and 2
A13CIO6G317VM0 B00HD4QAEQ 5 1388275200 33 I love this game it's never boring something new is always happening love dressing up looking pretty love the shoes cant wait to see the next level oh and add me ccdeluna thanks
A13CIO6G317VM0 B00BMW6ER8 5 1396915200 29 I love it it's fast my style move up fast and nice and clear and some of the voices make me laugh but it is awesome hate to quite
A13CIO6G317VM0 B00JVZ0DQG 5 1402012800 20 Its fun its easy rewards are good youll love it when you start it and you wont want to quit
A13CRVVIYL9P6V B008S4YZCO 5 1373932800 28 Monster life is the best game I've played plus the monsters  are adorable!!!!! Anyways I have one suggestion though can you make more of the monsters worth coins?
A13CRVVIYL9P6V B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393027200 23 This game is just as annoying as the old one I really recommend you get this if you liked the old floppy bird
A13CRVVIYL9P6V B00FXKHEK6 5 1383091200 53 This is such a good game for kids and adults. My sister and I play it all day. Their is always something new. Their is never the same character. And you don't have to give up as much coins for hints a other game. I recommend this game for anyone of any age.
A13CRVVIYL9P6V B00ESCOI7C 5 1379116800 58 Such a good app it's challenging which is good so it's not easy. If you like a challenge get the app you will be happy with the app!!!! I like that their is categories and it starts you off with 450-500 coins the hints are not that much coins and rate the app to get 60 free coins
A13CTCYGTQHBUT B00GY0PQZ4 5 1397001600 27 A fun pass your time kind of game. Easy to play , easy to learn. Y Recommended game for all. Hopefully they keep on adding more levels.
A13CTCYGTQHBUT B00BX42FLY 5 1397520000 27 Nice puzzles. It can really make you think at times so good for your mind. Good way to past the time when you have time to spare.
A13CTCYGTQHBUT B00I6WBHD8 4 1405468800 42 Fun Game. I can only give it a 4 star because you get 5 tries and it takes thirty minutes to get another try don't even buy coins they cost way to much you'll be able to get them free through play.
A13CTCYGTQHBUT B008K6SYX6 5 1392163200 22 FUN GAME EASY TO PLAY RECOMMENDED FOR THE YOUNG AND OLD  FUN TO Play on THESE LONG WINTER DAYS Worth the money
A13CTZJEIPCTGG B00DJFIMW6 5 1376179200 23 I love this so much!! it is so easy for my nephews to use and it is fun for me too! EVERYONE WINS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A13CTZJEIPCTGG B005X9498M 3 1376179200 31 I mean its alright but u cant  enter ur pics u cant enter ur music u cant enter the games. its more like a boring wallpaper it needs an UPDATE!!!!!!! PRONTO
A13CTZJEIPCTGG B009ZZDNT6 5 1376179200 24 I love the alarm clock because u can keep it in ur bed with u and it is still really loud I love it
A13CTZJEIPCTGG B004Z9Y3VY 5 1340150400 42 I don't know why everyone says it is so stupid. it is actually really funny. I laugh every time. it is so hilarious. I love ot. it makes me and my friends occupied and it keeps us lathing for hours and hours.
A13CV346LMKKLB B00FAPF5U0 4 1402531200 40 Everyone kept saying it was a great game, well they are right! I did get stuck on one level though and thought I would be there forever! Finally after 3 months I was able to move on. What a challenge!!
A13CV346LMKKLB B00975HIYU 5 1391472000 28 These slot games are lots of fun, different levels and it doesn't take long to get hooked. You get free coins every 3-4 hours and I enjoy playing.
A13CV346LMKKLB B008K6G8CK 5 1396224000 27 really enjoy the variety of games to choosefrom, something for everyone. I play wheel of fortune, deal or no deal, and bingo, but also card games too.
A13CV346LMKKLB B0081JPTXK 4 1391472000 48 I have been playing at Doubledown Casino for at least 2 years and they just keep coming up with new slots! It's a lot of fun to play and a lot of my friends play too ,that's more free chips for us all and I enjoy  the games.
A13CWTX5T80RJO B009OYOASG 5 1351296000 26 I love this game.  would like for the gems to come easier but its still fun.  I love how you can pick different things to cook.
A13CWTX5T80RJO B008Y0REKC 5 1346889600 28 this game is too cute!  I love the interaction you can do with the monsters.  great game so far!!!!  a must have if you like raising different things.
A13CWTX5T80RJO B007VT07QU 5 1337212800 25 i love this game!  you explore different parts of the island while doing quests.  it is time consuming and loads of fun!  a must have!
A13CX5BZ60WC7V B007693VXG 1 1335830400 23 omg this is stupid! on my friends Ipod touch it is a lot better! not for the kindle fire though! don't get it!
A13D1TTHSB7D0A B007ZGO7EM 5 1348444800 21 awesome.  great app,  big numbers that are easy to see. very very easy to use.  love it and would definitely recommend
A13D1TTHSB7D0A B00CKW6FVE 4 1370822400 31 I have found this game exciting but not as good as the original. The power ups are ridiculously priced compared to the amount of coins that can be won per game.
A13D2NMAYDDVH B00I8Q77Y0 3 1396742400 28 This app isn't the best flappy bird app out there but I will give them some credit for trying. You should just get it from 1mobile market instead.
A13D2NMAYDDVH B00GY0HJ4K 1 1396742400 25 Honey, don't you be bein goin round wastin yo time on dis stupid app bae, you will regret it. So please don't download this app
A13D2NMAYDDVH B00JV858HM 5 1399161600 39 I loved it it's awesome and swag hard level is sometimes hard but easy level basically tells you the answers. Great word puzzle game for all ages. I highly recommended that you download it. Deserves 5 stars(: (: (:
A13D4M9JIPUX8B B00AOA9BL0 1 1388707200 20 It worked and then they did something so it will not let me connect to the internet through my router.
A13D4M9JIPUX8B B004DLNC4I 4 1388707200 33 Using on my Kindle fire, the volume is not as loud as I would like it. It has it's moments, but as a new kindle owner it's fun to try the stuff out.
A13D6KDA65KHJM B009LGKCS4 5 1369872000 34 I'm enjoying this game so much. I have tried similar games before but this one stands out best among them all. The graphics is awesome and the quotes by Einstein seals the deal....quite addictive.
A13D6KDA65KHJM B0066T8SDU 4 1356739200 22 great game. just like the original. no regrets purchasing it. I enjoy it so much. The PC levels play exactly as chosen.
A13D6KDA65KHJM B00BJRH6HS 5 1371513600 28 takes a little while to get used to but quite addictive and interesting. My eight year old got frustrated at first but got it and enjoying the challenge.
A13D6LW5NDGERK B004H6WTJI 5 1357776000 57 My husband and I have been using this app to track our food intake and exercise as well as networking with others on their own fitness journey to stay motivated.  We were able to get our mothers to join and help us with our success. This is very easy to use and helps keep you on track.
A13D6LW5NDGERK B007ZGO7EM 5 1370304000 25 I use this calculator for all of my number crunching and really like it.  The large numbers make it very easy to read and use!
A13D6LW5NDGERK B0064X7B4A 5 1362009600 33 I play this game with so many friends and family throughout the day and we are also able to chat while we play.  It's great because you can play at your own pace!!
A13DCD9PB6KAL4 B007DLSWJ0 1 1339804800 29 Instead of it cleaning your screen it makes you want to punch your screen. Its cute at first but then its annoying. urrggghhhh disappointed don't even watste zero dollars.
A13DCD9PB6KAL4 B00BG3ID0Y 4 1364342400 20 Its a very good game to challenge you and help on a day when you are very bored!Get it now!
A13DCD9PB6KAL4 B0075ASHQM 5 1334966400 28 its very funny and interesting!  I'm not even old enlighten to be typing this my friend that's a boy was wearing a dress, he should be on there
A13DCV9ZZTY20F B007SYWFRM 4 1334707200 23 i don't like that you have to be on a social network to gain friend points. others than that I like the game.
A13DCV9ZZTY20F B007KQ6XYY 5 1333065600 22 I love this game.  I finished this game in two days.  I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait for more levels.
A13DCV9ZZTY20F B008N8IV2U 5 1344211200 23 for the kindle on level 40 u just have to trace the line and turn it green I turned the volume down too
A13DDUPHU6FH8L B00529IOXO 5 1365984000 21 U can text anywhere I love it u should buy it :):):);):);):):) it so aswome  love it a lot  buy it
A13DDUPHU6FH8L B00H44JGU0 5 1396137600 24 This is so cool I love w I've getting better at drawing day I just love it a lot I can't stop using it
A13DDUPHU6FH8L B00DUGCLY4 5 1403049600 21 Yall should get it it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo coooool i cant stop playing itttttt i play all night because its so awsome
A13DE6UVF61OFN B00FOYE7IS 4 1383523200 25 They ask for a rating on the sixth level but so far it is cute. I guess time will tell as the game goes on.
A13DE6UVF61OFN B0086700CM 5 1338249600 28 This game is additive. I really like playing and sometimes my kids will play it too. I have not gotten very far yet but it is fun trying.
A13DE6UVF61OFN B00ANGMT0U 4 1382659200 77 I think the game is fun but I am not fond of the fact that there are quest telling you what you need to but not how to do it. You need rubies to get a lot of things but they are not easy to get unless you want to use real money to buy them. Some of the clearing and building that a little longer than I care for but over all a fun little game.
A13DE6UVF61OFN B006VW94HQ 5 1330041600 32 It is a very addictive game, once you get started it is hard to stop! I am happy that I got this app! I like word games and this one is fun.
A13DE6UVF61OFN B004HGK6FW 4 1328486400 20 The only complaint I had was the &quot;you have a message&quot; that was flashing at the top of the screen.
A13DE6UVF61OFN B005FT0A8I 4 1343692800 50 This is a little different from the one I play on the computer but it does not take long to get use to it. I like the fact that you can tag the possible bombs and you can not do that on some of the other versions I have seen.
A13DFBHBNYV5BA B00AECGQF2 5 1383350400 30 I think this game is great. It's just that you don't have anything to do. Well anyway, the game is great and I think you will love it too.  =3
A13DFBHBNYV5BA B00820STKI 5 1357430400 29 This app is really fun. I spent a lot of time trying to make a really good show. If you buy this app I think you will love it.
A13DFO3LJ79XB4 B00A8ECU24 4 1396483200 42 I got this game for my two little sisters for when they play on my kindle fire. They absolutely love this game. So then I tried it for my self and that is how me, a preteen, is playing this fun game.
A13DFO3LJ79XB4 B006SMEV9K 4 1396483200 29 I like this app because I can text my friends who have this app. Plus I can write down notes for myself. This app is very fun and useful.
A13DFO3LJ79XB4 B00DJFIMW6 5 1396483200 24 I love this game out of all my other games. If you like temple run and subway surfer, then you will love MINON RUSH.
A13DFO3LJ79XB4 B00A4EZ3QS 2 1396483200 42 When I play, I can't ever get past level one no matter what I do, so I just ignore it. It's also fun playing it because I'm a candy crush lover. But this game was a waste of my app space. :(
A13DFXJZQLBPJ0 B00E8KLWB4 1 1403136000 27 1 star because I can't give it no stars. I got this because I like their other products, but it would not load on my Kindle Fire.
A13DFXJZQLBPJ0 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1393027200 47 Thoroughly. LOVED this game!!! It was very intriguing.  Puzzles were challenging and made you think outside the box. Really liked that the hints pointed you in the next direction without just telling you the solution. Very well done. Am going to look for the second one now.
A13DH2O8LAEHMB B004DPC5Y2 3 1373760000 28 My son loves the game, but I think the other Monkey game helps him learn more.  He may like the other more because he really likes sea creatures.
A13DH2O8LAEHMB B004UID2LC 4 1375142400 52 It's alot easier to download videos onto my Kindle Fire.  The one thing I don't like is that it lists all the videos together.  I haven't been able to figure out if there's a way to group certain videos together.  For now, though, it works for my purposes.  I'd highly recommend it!
A13DI128THYL57 B008XG1X18 5 1365379200 21 All's well, no issues, no complaints. I love pinterest, love the convenience of having it accessible on my tablet &amp;/or phone.
A13DI128THYL57 B00FIW5BZE 5 1388448000 34 Love it. So many lay outs and so many style options. I like how big the tiles are also. I enjoy this app much more than any other Majong tile game I've downloaded prior.
A13DI128THYL57 B00AA87JGU 3 1391904000 44 This game is different than most other escape games I've played. I don't like the way the tool box / menu works... and the app overall doesn't give enough directions on things, such as timer? Coins? Fun, but somewhat confusing as a new player.
A13DNQ2QCXQ7PO B007MTKYQC 5 1333238400 41 This app is one of my favorite apps and it can entertain you for so long .But it can get confusing at some points in the game. But the main point is that it is one of the best games ever.
A13DNQ2QCXQ7PO B00657H8XO 5 1338076800 20 Success Story is my favorite game ever. If you don't have this yet you have to get it. Its amazing!!!!!
A13DNQ2QCXQ7PO B007LCZJPQ 4 1334448000 21 This game is awesome. I could play ot all day because it is so fun going through all the mazes!!!  B-)
A13DNQ2QCXQ7PO B007HH3K5G 5 1338076800 23 I absolutely love zoo story. It is so much fun to take care of the animals. Also you can communicate with you're friends.
A13DPK6OI8PWD7 B008Y7SMQU 5 1356048000 23 this app has got me on my toes. quiet a few I miss because I don't see them daily. good brain. food! !
A13DPK6OI8PWD7 B00FLMU7BY 5 1384646400 20 this is a great way for me and hubby to spend some time together.  thanks for making this game. awesome.
A13DPK6OI8PWD7 B0063IH60K 4 1341014400 22 got this game to pass some time on lunch break. easy to play and win. not bad for free app. thank you.
A13DPLI03YN0Z7 B008MAGJTQ 1 1389830400 22 It loaded...played it for awhile...then it unloaded:-(  it won't. Let me reload. How can it be fixed or reload.? I want it
A13DPLI03YN0Z7 B00CX713IG 4 1382400000 19 Love this game . It took me awhile to get through all it's levels.Wish they had more like it.
A13DPLI03YN0Z7 B008K6HN8I 2 1388966400 37 I liked what it does. Puts pictres in folders. But it is hard to work with.  Wisj ot was easier to work with. If they come out with an app that is easier i will get it.
A13DQCDA29XFWZ B00CSR2J9I 5 1369440000 20 it is an awesome game for little kids and adults. I love it it is so much fun to play.
A13DQCDA29XFWZ B00D9SC4TA 3 1371945600 21 its a little boring you do the same thing over and over again if you want to get but I wouldn't.
A13DQCDA29XFWZ B009UX2YAC 5 1371945600 34 it is a fun game for kids all ages it is so fun you get to play with friends or play alone. You get to buy characters and power with the coins you earned.
A13DQCDA29XFWZ B00BGC5UAG 3 1364515200 20 Its a really cool but it gets real complicated. I like I just don't love like other people do. so
A13DQCDA29XFWZ B00BUIPN62 5 1364601600 49 I love this game it is so fun. it is awesome you will have so much fun if you get this you will have so much fun you will love it. if you get get like 16 thousand points you will get on the globel on amazon game list.

A13DRR86VIQVDR B00E3OUQ5S 5 1387584000 27 It is cool but I can barely aim IT is kind of  good so I am going to give it a5/5 because it some times aims good

A13DS4LZ9P69RG B00FX6ZBXC 5 1389916800 47 Playing against computer is great fast paced brain game.  Would you consider easier,  faster method of earning Chums or even making it totally free  and  accessable without any restrictions  in order to  order to play against  the computer ?  Love playing with other players just too slow.
A13DS4LZ9P69RG B00DHKKN6Q 5 1392422400 21 Great for improving motor skills while having fun and I don't have to spend money.  Try it you'll like it !!
A13DS4LZ9P69RG B008Y2FRFO 4 1393632000 22 Fun.  Wish there were more &quot;free&quot; coins to play.  Fixed income prevents extra purchases.  As I said, fun yet requires some skill.
A13DS4LZ9P69RG B004HE5TAG 5 1399939200 50 Love Blackjack.  The speed of game is fantastic.  This app has completely banished the most annoying feature of most games. waiting, waiting and waiting.  Thanks for producing a challenging game to hone my skills of judgement,  improving my impaired motor skills (impaired due to heart failure) and just plain FUN.
A13DS6M8DB90YP B004VMVTNU 5 1314576000 216 Overview: This has been Lifehacker's choice as the alarm clock app to get for some time. Simply put, this is the all in one alarm clock app that you have been looking for. It will use your playlist or phone/tablet sounds to alert you for whatever you need. It is fully customizable, can be used as either a stopwatch or specific timed alarm clock. Basically, it makes it simple to use your phone as an alarm clock.Positives: Easy to set up, there are recurring alarm settings or one time only alarms. The snooze function can be customized to have endless snoozes or just a few. As far as snoozing, it gives you the option to press a button, shake the phone or even solve math problems. The volume can also be set to crescendo, which is nice in the morning, or come at you blaring if desired. The ability to listen to your music when waking up is a nice touch that is hard to believe is not a standard feature on all phones/tablets.Negatives: No sleep timer. Also, careful with the options at first, you may get something unexpected.Best feature: The available extra-large Snooze button. Basically, it takes up the whole screen and pressing almost anywhere will enable it. Very impressive especially on a 10" tablet.
A13DS6M8DB90YP B008IJT0CE 5 1386720000 305 Overall: After searching for such a long time on both iTunes and Google Play, I ran into this app which is the best relaxation app around. Relax Melodies Premium is a very nice easy to use app that creates soothing ambiance whenever you need it. Provided are a choice of what seems like close to 100 melodies/ tracks which play over and over in a loop. You can choose which of these tracks to play together so that you create your own calming music.Pros: The selection is quite impressive. For instance, you can put together the sound of the water on the beach with a thunder storm. Or, chimes can be played with the pleasant burble of a river. There is no limit to how many of the sounds you can play together so there are literally hundreds if not thousands of soundtracks to be made. And, because the sounds are so customizable, you can make one to fit your mood at any time!Cons: Button selection is sometimes tedious as you need to push the square representing a sound exactly in the center. Also, this app does not have a lockscreen or slide down menu widget which means that you need to be in the app itself to start or stop the music.Most Useful Features: The timer is handy because you can start the music, let it go and it will stop after a prescribed amount of time. This is very useful for me as I use the app when I put my daughter to sleep. The melody is so soothing that I will usually fall asleep too! Also, there is a &#8216;Favorites&#8217; selection which is populated with melodies that the app developers provided as a template. This feature enables you to add your favorite combinations as you start to mix and match the sounds.Enjoy!
A13DS6M8DB90YP B004X80QNG 4 1337644800 264 Informant is an all in one app for productivity power users. It attempts to combine a calendar and to-do list into a streamlined format. However, as I will explain in a moment, it only partially delivers.Pro: This app seems designed specifically with Toodledo users in mind. It logs into the service with barely an issue and syncs with all of your folders, contexts, whatever with relative ease. Make a ToDo item, bam! It's on your Toodledo service as soon as you hit sync. Contexts, notes, due dates, everything pops up on the webapp almost instantaneously. I found that Toodledo by itself is alright, but add in Informant and I just can't live without it!Con: The easiest way to say this, is everything but Toodledo syncing. The app connects with your Google services to integrate Tasks and Calendar, which is a nice touch. But, unfortunately, it does this so poorly that it is not worth even setting up. The calendar service is slow especially compared to the stock calendar. Google Task integration is almost non-existent. In fact, every time I attempted to sync with Google Tasks completely screwed up my lists. Basically, don't try it!Most Useful Features:  As mentioned above, Toodledo syncing. Toodledo is one of those services that requires a mobile device to access, just so that your ToDo list is available whenever you need it. Informant makes this possible. Also, when creating a task, I especially like the alarm feature of the app. The app will set up a gentle reminder using your phone/tablet alarm system for any task you want. Very nice!
A13DS6M8DB90YP B004W4LMGQ 5 1318464000 276 Overview: This app is awesome if you have multiple chat services, like many people, and always want to stay connected. Some of the most popular IMs are available which makes this app very versatile. For instance, I am able to see my chat buddies for Yahoo, Facebook and Google Talk all at once. Think of this app as an extension to PC/Mac apps which do similar functions, just for your phone/tablet. Which, by the way, works very well on both.Pros: Multiple logins to chat services (as stated above). Access to many of the most popular IM services such as Facebook, IRQ, Yahoo and Google Talk. Full screen integration for tablet functionality. The app works very well in the background should you decide to check e-mail, surf the web or whatever. While many other chat apps, such as the Facebook app, keep hanging up on you, and make it so you go in and out of login, this app is steady as a rock. In fact, when I tell people that I am on my tablet chatting, they are surprised.Cons: Not every single service is available. However, the list is very extensive and should meet most people's needs. Also, if you are using a Bluetooth keyboard, the chat `resets' itself every so often forcing you to back out of the app.Most useful feature: Definitely the push message notifications. Exit the app (which by the way, completely shuts down as confirmed by the task manager) and all your ongoing chats are still active. Then, should someone want to add that one last thought, the app will notifiy you even after closing. Very cool, especially for prolonging battery life.
A13DS6M8DB90YP B005D9MUWY 5 1354233600 369 Overall: The absolute must have replacement keyboard available. Many keyboards try to provide the best typing experience but SwiftKey performs. The prediction capabilities for this keyboard are like no other. The beauty is that while you only get 3 prediction choices, that is all you really need. A must have essential app that everyone should give a try. The free version gives you a taste for a month before taking away the best part, the predictions. After that, it is time to commit. But trust me, using this keyboard is the best choice you could make.Pros: The keyboard layout is nice for typing, especially using the 2 thumb method on portrait mode. Once you get going with the typing, the predictions just keep coming which makes the app a little scary in how good it is at guessing what you will want to say next. This is especially true for phrases that you say the most and for corrections which occur almost simultaneously. The keyboard understands your intent most of the time and is able to figure out for the most part what word you tried to spell. This gives for very quick typing because it no longer matters if you hit the exact key order anymore! As a last point, the symbol keys are very quick to be pressed and there is only one choice per key. An example would be that when the letter 'q' is held down, the number 1 pops up almost immediately.Cons: Not many. I would say that actually having to spell a new word or one not used much can be a hassle, which means that you have to precisely type the word out. Additionally, one finger typing is not this keyboard's strong suite even though it is still fast using this method (Swype is much faster using one finger). Lastly, the landscape layout is not my favorite as keys are spaced far apart, especially on bigger screens.Most useful feature: The quick erase function. Much like the ctrl + backspace on Microsoft Word, you can erase the previous word by simply swiping right to left. This is really cool because then you no longer have to stop to erase, just swipe and go!
A13DS6M8DB90YP B00GY0HJ4K 5 1396569600 137 Basic Story:This is a fun play on the 'bejeweled' style games where the objective is to match up objects of the same color. However, in this instance, you should think Jellies instead of Jewels. The nice thing about this game is that it gives a lot of free will to create long 'strings' of jellies. And, the game puts a limit on how many tries you have to beat the levels which is something I have never seen before in a game. Therefore, you will not be able to stay up all night trying to beat that impossible level because the game won't let you, nice!Game Highlights:&#8226; Good for young children&#8226; Sound effects cute and addictive&#8226; In app purchasing insistent but not unreasonable&#8226; Provides a limit to game play (5 tries per 4 hours)&#8226; Lots of fun!
A13DS6M8DB90YP B00G9B1MEM 3 1396224000 56 This is a weird little game that will take you to the edge of weirdness. Not sure who thought up the concept or even what the exact point is. But, if you want to go on a freaky clay trip for a few, this is the game for you.Please don't say that I didn't warn you
A13DS6M8DB90YP B00IF2JW8G 4 1396224000 57 Here is the basic jist of the game: Sonic runs. Then, you hit something or trip or fall off the ledge. Then, they try to sell you stuff. Rinse and repeat. But, the game is exceedingly addictive for the times when you are actually playing. Enjoy this freemium app, it was very well crafted. Good job Sega!
A13DS6M8DB90YP B00DHQ0MGQ 4 1397088000 70 Basic story:Fling a cat so that it explodes near a kitten. Collect gems and 'suns'. Get intense satisfaction knowing that you won something. This is an app that if you don't pay attention to time, you could probably play for hours without realizing it.Game highlights:&#8226;Fuzzy kitties&#8226;Repetative and addictive sound track&#8226;Adorable sound effects (lots of meowing)&#8226;Cats explode which is considered normal&#8226;Upgrades to abilities are questionable&#8226;Gameplay is simple and intuitive&#8226;Good for kids
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B006PKQQSE 5 1347667200 24 this is a great little game. it's not only an easy on the eyes type of app, but it is very well put together.
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B004HMJ5QM 5 1303084800 40 Great for tracking menstration and fertile days. Even if you're not trying to get preggers. Easy entry, easy to see and understand the display.  I love it and any chick that wants to easily track her Aunt Flow will too.
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B004TBM4VY 5 1373328000 30 I don't always want to play a fast paced game, and when I don't this little app really comes in handy. Works beautifully on my tablet, with no graphics issues.
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B008Y212PI 3 1380499200 29 This is a nice and easy game to play before bed. I don't really care for unlocking &quot;bonus&quot; level by liking or rating, but whatever. Is this enough words?
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B00H1TX87A 5 1396742400 20 Rhizome is shops example of a truly playable escape game.  Got it as the FAOTD but certainly worth the price.
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B009XFDFPU 4 1364947200 25 This is a beautifully designed game to say the least. If you like match 3 games, this a great one to add to your stash.
A13DUPR8FZUQNA B006D1ONE4 5 1329955200 23 Absolutely addicting game! Great graphics, with challenging yet easily understood game play. Winner from ages 4 to 40! Download and see for yourself!
A13DXE9G1NRMLH B00FXKHEK6 5 1384041600 25 I have really enjoyed playing this. It brings back memories from my childhood. Definitely love playing this game when I need a good time killer.
A13DXE9G1NRMLH B0054JZC6E 5 1329091200 33 I just downloaded this on my kindle fire and I have had a blast playing it. Some levels are challenging but that is what makes it fun. I really like the old.school games.
A13DXE9G1NRMLH B00EBE8MUG 5 1378512000 21 This has definitely been fun to play. My husband and I play all the time together and we keep score lol.
A13DYQ6VJWAR21 B0076ANQQC 5 1330128000 31 Love it.  Good learning tool for my toddlers.  Keeps them occupied and they love learning all of the shapes and floors.  If you have little ones this is a great app.
A13DYQ6VJWAR21 B009UWL580 5 1352419200 21 This game is totally addictive.  Just wish you did not have to buy extra chances.  Takes me back to my childhood.
A13DYQ6VJWAR21 B008JJS6D2 4 1348099200 22 Good game for both kids and adults.  Reminds me of playing this classic as a child.  Great that it is also free.
A13E0M9VCOAHAW B004VMVTNU 5 1320796800 27 This is hands down the best alarm app that I have used. The ascending tone is much less abrasive than having it begin at full volume.Great alarm.
A13E3O1S0X2MHJ B008B0S0XK 5 1399766400 33 When I was little I lived right next to an arcade that had the NBA Jam machine. It was my favorite machine there, and now I can play NBA Jam whenever I want!
A13E3O1S0X2MHJ B008469DGY 5 1399766400 62 It's not a regular golf game. It's not a full course, and you're not really going to do any putting. What you will do is smack the crap out of that ball and change the direction it's going in. It's fun & addictive, and at that it's one of my favorite time wasters. The price tag is just about perfect too. ;)
A13E3O1S0X2MHJ B009L9Z6G4 5 1399766400 30 If you're like me and LOVE the WWE, you really need to download this app.It's great for when you've got nothing to do, or you're taking an especially long crap!
A13E3O1S0X2MHJ B0085VR7WU 5 1399766400 32 It's farkle. You get what you expect, and it's fun. Whenever my grandmother comes over she asks for my kindle so that she can play it. I think she may be addicted.
A13E3O1S0X2MHJ B007K8RFJ4 5 1399766400 42 If you're like me and constantly looks remotes and stuff like that you'll love this.I admit it, sometimes my Roku remote just &#34;disappears&#34;, but my Kindle doesn't. When I &#34;lose&#34; my Roku remote I just use this app and it works perfectly.
A13E3O1S0X2MHJ B008JK6W5K 4 1399766400 26 Fun little game. Great for wasting time. It shows logos, and you guess them. I figured I'd be better at it than I am, but alas..
A13E5W8W5DQV5I B008JGSM6G 4 1393286400 20 Fun and addicting game. It took quite a bite of strategy to solve. Great for anyone who need a challenge.
A13EBLDXVEJND1 B00BPC23XO 4 1366761600 55 I had to rate this after only one level, so I am not sure my opinion will hold. SO FAR it is one of the best 4 word 1 pic games because you can skip pics. I like the extra points if you guess correctly in less than 4 pics. The hints are expensive, though.
A13EBLDXVEJND1 B004TTY694 2 1344384000 64 I picked this specific app for my kindle fire because it said I could email notes as a backup saving option. Nope. The only 'share' option listed is facebook and even that doesn't work! Plus, to edit the title of a note you have to use options on your phone- again, can't do that with a kindle fire. Time to look for another app.
A13EBLDXVEJND1 B00BGAZYLI 2 1363219200 72 I really, really enjoy this game, BUT, I quickly went through all the levels. Now I am left with the option of replying the same game over and over (boring) or &quot;wait for the next version&quot;. No info provided on when that next version will be available or how to get it. Good thing it was free or I'd be highly annoyed... hey, that may be the catch- it was free. Typical.
A13EBLDXVEJND1 B0085VR7WU 1 1355875200 46 I really liked this app.... for the one day it worked!!! The second day I used it, it gave me 200 bonus chips. After the first round, ALL my chips were gone. I went back on 2 days in a row and they never came back.
A13EBLNSV40LFD B00E0I9EEG 4 1377907200 28 This is greatest for your teenagers ready to drive it is great practice and I love it for fun I recommend itEnjoy and you will not be dissappointed
A13EBLNSV40LFD B00CDBLC8S 5 1378771200 23 Awsome it's really great.  I recommend it anyone who likes puzzlesGreat way for kids to learn as well get it now and enjoy
A13EBLNSV40LFD B00EBQRSTK 5 1403222400 29 Very entertaining and easy to play and you don't lose coins by using all four pictures at once. I would recommend it even a third grader can do it
A13EC2I5MGT7QW B00881PTRC 5 1366761600 52 First off let me say that this is a must have game for hangman enthusiasts. There are plenty of categories to choose from. After you have failed to win, they give you an option to look up the meaning of the word through various dictionary sites. The animations are cute and hilarious!
A13EC2I5MGT7QW B009JNXK88 5 1352073600 27 Fantastic game if you need to pass the time. I got it for free from Amazon's free app of the day program, but it's worth the $0.99!
A13EC2I5MGT7QW B005FYBN1G 5 1368748800 126 First let me say that I have no idea why people are reviewing that the controls are difficult. I'm using a  GS3 and the controls are very smooth. There isn't any jittering or over sensitive movement.The concept of the game is to destroy all of the tanks in the arena before they destroy you. It's easy at first, but becomes more challenging as you go up levels. In the later levels, you are provided obstacles to hide behind. The best part about the game is the radar in the right hand corner. It's very accurate and easy to read at a quick glance.Overall, the graphics are simple, the gameplay is amusing, and there are no permissions required to install. That is 5 stars in my book.
A13EC2I5MGT7QW B00AW3FDIO 5 1373155200 28 This game is a very entertaining for all ages. It has a playful cartoonish vibe that works well for the game. Graphics are very vibrant and crystal clear.
A13EEI6YVFIUC5 B0081JPTXK 1 1360368000 126 I've been playing doubledown on FB for several years and like it so when I saw this app I was very happy.  Now that I've had it and played it for 6 months, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  Like all of the others I have huge problems with it losing connection (and none of my other apps have that problem), I have bits of music all over my kindle in my music that are ridiculous and even tho it's free money that I play I find it odd that I can NEVER end a session with more than I started with.  If a real casino was like that no one would ever go.  I've never bought chips, nor will I with the way it paysback.
A13EEI6YVFIUC5 B0064X7B4A 1 1334880000 112 It's sad to see an app that used to be a solid 4-5 star game being overtaken by all of the 1star ratings it's now getting since the update.  I would have rated this a 5 before the update.  Now with an ad after every word I play that's not an option for me.  It's not just the ads.  It's the TINY little box you get to skip them........I'm afraid that I'm going to accidentally miss and end up with something on my Fire that I don't want and then I'm gonna have to deal with uninstalling it.  I still play but now I have to worry after every word.  It sucks!!!!
A13EEI6YVFIUC5 B00EBFKPAA 5 1378339200 20 just got this but i can already tell i will quickly become addicted.  great pictures. great songs. lots of fun
A13EEI6YVFIUC5 B00BNH1PF8 4 1363564800 26 love a game that makes me use my mind.  some words are easy and some I've had to really think about.  great game for the priceless
A13EEI6YVFIUC5 B008JGSM6G 5 1363824000 25 great way to pass the time.  starts easy and gets more challenging as you go.  and the price is definitely right.  fun for all ages.
A13EEI6YVFIUC5 B008XG1X18 5 1346976000 72 Was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews on here but it was needless.  Put it on my Fire about a week ago.....have spent even more time on it than ever!  Does occasionally take a little longer to open and I have had to force close a few times but I have problems with some sites on my computor when it's  prime time.  Don't  let the bad reviews scare you.
A13EEVVS8EODKK B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392336000 22 Since Flappy Bird wasn't on the Appstore before I wanted to play Flappy Bird on a bigger screen. This app is great!
A13EEVVS8EODKK B00IKZX1ZI 5 1398729600 77 I saw the movie and I loved it so much, I couldn't help myself but to try the game. Trust me, it wasn't a mistake. It's like Bejeweled or Candy Crush Saga, you match up &amp;#34;ice crystals&amp;#34;. The only negative about this game is you have to buy power ups, but they give you trials so you don't waste your money on a bad power up. Overall, I love this game and you can enjoy it anywhere!
A13EEVVS8EODKK B00JTKDTLE 5 1399766400 28 This app is addicting and fun! It has four gameplay options and it sounds like a piano! This app has no glitches so far and I love it.
A13EL99USHSLKA B00BUQBQN8 5 1368144000 21 No problems at all.. works great for me! If you like Etsy (and who doesn't!) then you will like the App!
A13EL99USHSLKA B008XG1X18 5 1357171200 20 I use this on my kindle fire. works very well. no complaints. never causes me any problems or crashes .
A13EL99USHSLKA B004SIIBGU 5 1368144000 30 Took me a second to figure it out.. but very easy and I have had no problems. I will recommend this app if you use Ebay you need this App
A13ELECMKI1SK9 B004H6WTJI 1 1385769600 20 Too costly, and it was tedious to enter the information.  I was looking for something different and easier to use
A13ELECMKI1SK9 B007N8RULO 5 1358640000 24 Great game that passes the time while traveling.  Graphics are good and it is easy to play.  You can start right after being downloaded.
A13ELECMKI1SK9 B00HEFEDAM 4 1390262400 41 Really like the game.  It is easy to learn and play.  Passes the time away when you are in the doctors office or waiting for car repair. Not a pressure game but very addictive.  I would recommend this for all ages.
A13ELTHFYO46N9 B00E5GJ7QS 5 1403222400 33 I have to say this game surprise me in just how much fun it really is, I honestly thought it would be boring, but it is a game the whole family will enjoy.
A13ELTHFYO46N9 B00FEMJF6O 5 1392508800 21 Fun, entertaining, easy, love the graphics. Just like the Facebook game but mobile. Crazy good time. Kid tested and mother approved.
A13ELTHFYO46N9 B00A3NQNUU 5 1383004800 27 Love it,it has good graphics and it is very easy for my family.My children love the baby dragons. They love the pictures. They send hours playing it.
A13EM0DH4AET3J B00D57N4O4 3 1376352000 22 I am so hooked on another app.  This could not compare. But I am a bingo fanatic and particular about my bingo.
A13EM0DH4AET3J B0081JPTXK 5 1396483200 25 I love this game! Play everyday! Enjoy the casino excitement without losing real money! I recommend it to people who likes the real casino games!
A13EM0DH4AET3J B00C7X0ZNU 4 1378771200 26 I love the website. But sometimes I have trouble getting into it. I love the games. I feel I have the casino right in my home.
A13EMSAA84BPU1 B008IJTFYW 5 1344556800 32 it really works! it is very relaxing. the sounds are very authentic!  I normally have a hard time falling to sleep.  but this helps me float into a dream!  thumbs up :)
A13EMSAA84BPU1 B006ZMEI3W 5 1336003200 20 love love this game. it is challenging, but not to hard.  fun and addictive.  well worth the money. and more!!!
A13EMSAA84BPU1 B00A4KVFLY 3 1359590400 59 this game would get five stars if they read out the question to you.  like they do on the show.  having to read it slows you down.  this is my biggest complaint and frustration.  and it could have better graphics and more interacting with other players. real teams against teams. pimp it out. I would pay for that!  :)
A13ETXASMMTL6G B009UX2YAC 4 1388275200 42 It's a really fun game to play on my Kindle Fire, & I'm glad it doesn't need an internet connection to be played. Very addicting haha. I so far haven't encountered any problems with the app itself, so I'm really happy c:
A13ETXASMMTL6G B004SOR4H6 4 1390176000 20 Really cool layout, just like any other Twitter app on a mobile device. No problems were encountered, which is lovely.
A13ETXASMMTL6G B006SMEV9K 4 1388275200 27 I love this Notepad app! It's simple, & isn't confusing with many MANY features like other note-taking apps. It has just enough to keep me happy (:
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00AQ398AY 5 1390176000 84 Works perfectly fine for me; & I love this app because I can view how it's doing on my computer. I love the scanner, that scans the individual apps {at least, of my understanding} to see if any of them contain a virus. It also backs up my contacts, which is a life-saver. I can also view it's status on my KIndle Fire on the downbar {it doesn't automatically get there, you have to go to the settings to do so}. Really like it
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00594XOZU 4 1388275200 67 I'm glad that this app works on my Kindle Fire just fine, considering the reviews for this app. Everything works perfectly fine, besides the &#34;Photo Bomb&#34; feature; every time someone sends me a photo bomb & I tap it, the app freeze's & it must be closed & i restarts for me, which is a bummer. But notifications on my Kindle for any new messages work great
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00CO6TOBY 4 1390176000 26 Lots of choices on how to set the blocks, very fun & multiple mini-games {i guess they're called?} to play. Really like the game/app itself c:
A13ETXASMMTL6G B005V1N71W 4 1388275200 54 The music plays even if I'm not in the app itself, which is great. But it's a pain to have to go back to the app to pause the song playing. But other than that, no problems besides that sometimes Pandora can't load all the way so it makes itself freeze for some reason
A13ETXASMMTL6G B007BSPOG4 3 1388275200 42 The app is really cool; it's just like Skype except you get to be a little more custom with yourself & your profile in my opinion.But the app is constantly closing & freezing for me, & video calls are a bit laggy
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00BLS2U6M 3 1388275200 43 When i first got this app/game, it was seriously addicting haha. But the app is constantly &#34;not responding&#34;, which is really annoying because it's like, every 2 minutes. I run out of energy quite fast, which is also a bummer but oh well
A13ETXASMMTL6G B009HHX414 4 1388275200 74 Really cool, & I can view all my conversations both on my Kindle Fire & on my computer {by going on TextNow.com & logging in}. The only problem is that I can't always receive the pictures that a friend or someone sends to me. Oh, that & I don't receive a notification right when I receive the text itself; maybe like 3 minutes later I'd get the notification. Other than that, I love it!
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00DY76ZC8 4 1388275200 41 Works great on my Kindle Fire! The only thing that upsets me is that the servers are constantly down; or when I do have an internet connection, it tells me that I don't. But other than that, I love the app
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00FB13Y74 4 1390176000 31 Very fun & addicting! But after a while it started to get a bit buggy, but other than that I love it! Very fun & constantly, challenges are provided to accomplish.
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00APKDEH6 4 1388275200 26 App works great! Really happy to know that I can view my dashboard & everything here on my Kindle Fire, & not just on my computer
A13ETXASMMTL6G B007ZGO7EM 5 1388275200 33 Amazing calculator app; it's very simple but works perfectly! Ad's aren't much of a bother, being that they're small enough that they shouldn't be a worry. Calculator fits entire screen, which I loveee
A13ETXASMMTL6G B00BMR5HOO 5 1388275200 33 Really cool, it lets me view the weather through my down bar, which I love because I'm lazy when it comes to having to open up the app to just view the weather.
A13EWRFXVWLMCH B007PT3QOQ 2 1336089600 27 I played this for a few days on my fire but then it glitched and then.I couldn't play it anymore.  I tried to ts but no luck.
A13EWSX2R158U3 B008YRVW0I 3 1376697600 89 This is the first Plarix game that I have been disappointed with. The game play is great (as with all of their other games that I have played and eventually bought), but I have to give it 3 stars due to the size of the graphics. They are way too small. I play on a Kindle Fire and there seems to be a lot of wasted space on either side of the actual game board. I would upgrade my rating and probably purchase this game if they enlarged it.
A13EWSX2R158U3 B008Y2FRFO 5 1348790400 72 I have played Coin Dozed on my son's phone whenever he was visiting and I was so excited when it became available on KF (kinds a sad commentary on my life,  huh?). This one of the most addicting games I'he ever played since the onset of video games years ago. My advice though is to have patience and not spend money on coins. Eventually they will increase by just playing the game.
A13EZ9EVMFW3KP B00B2V66VS 5 1359158400 36 A little bit of a learning curve for when to jump and duck for the new obstacles, but then lots of fun. Awesome graphics. Better game play as you build up coins to get the upgrades.
A13EZ9EVMFW3KP B0064X7FVE 1 1359158400 33 constant crashes. m points are a scam, more than 1/2 the time there is an error. weather forecast is usually wrong. errors prevent most videos from loading. what is going on weather channel?
A13EZ9EVMFW3KP B004S2FUH4 5 1334361600 26 Calculator is one of the best, if not the best,  for determining percentages of things. Lots of options to choose from make it easy to use.
A13F4W9JSPB7D B005UQ9FNC 4 1330819200 21 bird land is fun. great game. love all the pretty and fun birdies. the challenges and goals are fun to achieve.
A13F4W9JSPB7D B006OCM13M 4 1330819200 23 fun game. build your bakery. how much more fun can it get?! love the story games. they keep going and going and going.
A13F4W9JSPB7D B006OCM0G0 4 1330819200 21 FUN game! Glad to have it on the kindle. Love all the story games! They keep going and going and going.
A13F4W9JSPB7D B00BYJ6BUO 1 1372118400 23 Don't even try to use this app it's just aggravating. All it does is crash! You NEVER make through a whole program. EVER.
A13F4W9JSPB7D B006QCMPWM 3 1330819200 27 good game. i like the birds better.  down fall on these two games is after awhile playing game freeze, shut down and then refuse to open again.
A13F8MR9QDYVOM B00ABGEFWC 5 1355184000 31 I like playing the game though I wish it were much more easier to get the paint looking points and the hearts. other than that overall its a very cute game.
A13F8MR9QDYVOM B00FAPF5U0 5 1382832000 26 I love Candy Crush. Finally it is available for the kindle fire. I can play this game all day. I just wish more lives were available.
A13F8MR9QDYVOM B007SYWFRM 5 1334448000 28 This game is so fun and addictive. I enjoyed playing it with my son and continue to do so. I began looking for similar games for my son.
A13F8MR9QDYVOM B00A4KVFLY 4 1354320000 24 I love playing Family Feud against my friends and family. Never a dull moment when playing this game. I would recommend it to others.
A13F9G1TAPXGJG B00FVVR2ZO 5 1397347200 22 Love playing this game. The characters make it even more fun to play. This is one of my favorite hidden object games.
A13F9G1TAPXGJG B00DHKKN6Q 5 1376611200 21 One of the best games I have played. Better than poppitt  and other games I  have played. Very challenging and exciting.
A13FA7RMEGBU65 B00FRQ32N4 4 1391212800 19 thyis game s so much fun me and my brother vs all the time its pritty awson time burnerguys

A13FA7RMEGBU65 B00FAI2IUM 4 1391212800 23 this game has some pritty awsome fetures vs your friends is the most fun of them all beating there time or just racing
A13FCQW1R4WRZW B00AGOGOLE 5 1384646400 21 A real experience once you figure out how to use this thing. A laugh a minute great product for family photos
A13FCQW1R4WRZW B00E5GJ7QS 4 1390089600 26 Fun game. A little fast paced but all in all a lot of fun.I would  recommend this for anyone that likes a fast paced BINGO game.
A13FCQW1R4WRZW B00FAPF5U0 5 1382486400 20 Awesome game you just lose track of time while playing this one. So much fun trying to beat your friends.
A13FCQW1R4WRZW B00BNH81FU 5 1382400000 53 To me it is so worth the few pennies that you spend for the extra recipes. Some of us don't have time to hunt a recipe down on the net, I just look a or main dish or side and  there they are. There aren't too many to browse through unlike the Internet.
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B009SDHIPK 5 1352851200 33 takes time to get controls down but once u do a lot of fun takes time to unlock plays r u can pay for it best graphics ever seen on a tablet game
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B0080K98U0 5 1344988800 27 fun rpg with a good story only flaw is it wants u 2 buy stuff on line and have to be onlone 2 play but really fun
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B00529IOXO 5 1360108800 37 Best app ever just wish u could assign names but it's my only way to contact other people through text and never spent a dollar if everyone did this the cellphone company's would go out of business
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B007GE0X3M 4 1369440000 23 works fine no complaint :) the news when u want it and easy like ur mom :0 ooohh burn how about them apple's
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B0069G5Z9K 4 1346112000 22 it was great but then after level 20 it just got boring as hell would have keep it but started acting buggy
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B009HV8ULE 1 1352851200 21 wow what a dumb game wouldn't wast your tome downloading it let alone the 5 min I played it don't download
A13FDSQXCRY4TD B007VUA7VO 5 1346716800 20 tells me exactly how much batery. life I have left and what I can do in that time helps out
A13FFEG7UDG2N2 B00F3W1GAS 3 1382832000 21 This game get old quickly.  It is good just for goofing off.  You keep doing the same scenes over and over.
A13FFEG7UDG2N2 B00DJFIMW6 5 1382227200 24 This is very fun.  Keeps you entertained for hours.  I like the different levels and how you can go different directions for different outcomes.
A13FFEG7UDG2N2 B00DUVQIIY 3 1382832000 23 This game also gets old quickly.  You just keep playing the same scenes over and over. It is fun for a while though.
A13FFT7525S2G4 B004H6WTJI 5 1390521600 37 Keeping track of calories had never been fun, until now. Track every day real food, exercise choices include housework and trading care of children...it doesn't get any more real than that!First week and I've lost 8lbs already!
A13FFT7525S2G4 B00CWG9EUM 5 1392163200 28 Definitely a brain work out, probably one of the toughest games of this type I've played. Well worth paying to unlock the full version. Bring on number two!
A13FI7S0B1IAAS B00CWY76CC 5 1377993600 45 Fun and changing. Wish were more levels. I download it and was addicted. Couldn't put it down. Only problem was I finished all the levels in one day. Waiting for new levels. Hope they come soon. Everyone in my house love it. Even the kids
A13FJVX2IKEH4K B007TBAQCK 5 1381104000 49 I just love this slots game. It is very addictive. If you can deal with all the pop up offers to buy coins give it a shot. There are plenty of wins without paying a dime. Hook it up to Facebook and share coins with your cell phone too.
A13FJVX2IKEH4K B006SMEV9K 5 1387584000 37 I have this son my smart phone and use it frequently so I thought it would be nice on my Kindle Fire as well.  Best of all it is free.  Handy for making little notes to yourself.
A13FJVX2IKEH4K B00CJ77HU8 5 1387584000 28 If you like match 3 gem games, this one is a lot of fun.  It gets more challenging as you progress through the levels.  Hours of addicting fun.
A13FMYPPKHS7U4 B008Y2FRFO 5 1397088000 23 I am a Coin Dozer fan on any device. It works well on my kindle fire hdx. You get 44 coins each day...
A13FMYPPKHS7U4 B008BTX2CA 5 1397088000 26 I got this app and immediately noticed the difference on my Kindle. It warns that it could possibly damage it, but I haven't had any problems.
A13FMYPPKHS7U4 B00A6GNC1M 5 1397088000 65 I play this every night when I get home from work, just to unwind. It has so many different types of boards and rooms you can play in, and it gives you at least 23 free tickets (for playing) each day. I have been playing for free, and have never spent any $$ with this one. The free coins, tickets, and spins keep me going.
A13FMYPPKHS7U4 B004MC8CA2 5 1397088000 58 This is a good, simple bible study tool (for me). I can click on whatever version of the bible I want to use, pull up study plans by subject, category, etc. I can highlight, bookmark, store notes, etc. I can even connect with other people who are using this app and listen to the bible being read audibly.
A13FMYPPKHS7U4 B00HDSYZ1C 2 1397088000 61 what I don't like about this game is that it displays four pictures for you to look at and guess the title of a song. If you can't figure out what the picture is about, it will not give you the option to go on to a new song title, you cannot move on until you figure that same picture out.
A13FMYPPKHS7U4 B0064TVQ5E 5 1397088000 27 I have become addicted to this version of Mahjong in 3 days. It has so many boards, you can choose music, timer, etc, and I love it.
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B00A42SC5E 4 1359072000 22 pretty cool game for little boys that love power rangers and ninjas.  my son loves this app and plays a good bit
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B00AAIHGA4 4 1359072000 28 When I saw this available we immediately got it.  I use to love this game when I was a little kid and now got my son playing it!
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B004SJ3BCI 4 1359072000 20 My husband and son play this all the time.  THey are addicted to it.  Very happy to keep them busy.
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B007URBVA4 4 1359072000 21 We play this a lot with our family.  its fun and the kids enjoy playing it.  very good game for kids
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B008KVSIT6 2 1359072000 24 It will not stay on the screen the right way.  It flips opposite way? for some reason so we just got a different app.
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B005T87QCI 3 1359072000 24 My son is obsessed with this movie.  Watches over and over so we had to get this game.  Its ok, its a little hard
A13FOE8X2JGPE2 B00AM1EPB2 3 1359072000 25 I'm not a big fan of these kind of things, but my husband and son like these.  It's ok, doesnt' get play a lot though.
A13FROU2W8IQJ7 B00ANH526W 5 1373673600 23 This game is so amazing I will play it all day!  (: I'm in such good mood you wont believe it.~ Darling (:
A13FROU2W8IQJ7 B00DJFIMW6 5 1373673600 22 love this game I love the minions they are so cute and I love the movie :) it such a good game
A13FROU2W8IQJ7 B00ED4TX2A 5 1377302400 23 Love this. game I played it for 3 hours loll well it doesn't get boring at all well like the others I played
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B008BJQCCM 3 1376697600 44 OK, cute but gets boring really fast.  Good images from the movie, so it's not a total ripoff poorly done but it's marginal at best overall compared to all the other things out there.  Do a 2nd version and you could have a hit!
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B008Y2FRFO 4 1353456000 25 Can't stop, needs improvement in some controls but that won't keep you from playing! Edge needs adjusting as stuff drops that shouldn't. Great game though!
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B0066T0BTO 5 1376697600 27 You know all these versions they make just rock.  This has worked great on multiple devices including my OUYA!  Smooth, wild graphics and sound like you'd expect.
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B007USZX7U 3 1355356800 62 Love the game, love this rendition of it but if you're not online - you can't play.  So if the WiFi on my tablet drops out, this freaks out and/or won't start.  All for high scores and such?  Really, make it sync up instead unless you're all about the ad revenues Author.  I could bulk-download ad banners when syncing just as easily.
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B005ZXWMUS 5 1376697600 74 Works fine on anything I've installed it on - my Zeki tablet (which can be picky), my Samsung Stellar (Galaxy) AND even on my OUYA!!  I was stunned it worked there but it's very smooth which I didn't expect.  You know Netflix and their variety, this is the only version they really put out there so nothing is 'missing' and they interact with your other versions even on you game console and Smart TV's.
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B009EEFTMC 5 1361145600 81 I figured hey, I'll try it.  Poke a bit, something to do when needed.  I CAN'T STOP!  It's beyond addictive, it combines elements of mahjong and more but better than anything else I've seen online.  Flows seamlessly on a tab that likes to have running issues with things and I've doing Android ICS at the moment.  Allows tweets of achievements, very interactive, but way beyond what I expected.  Now I'm stuck swiping and poking for hours til the battery dies! LOL
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B0066T8M1I 5 1376697600 54 It's the same digital version roaming around, but it's worked great on my tablet, smartphone AND on my OUYA to boot!  The controls are basic and the finger-mouse pad on the OUYA is supported so playing it works just fine.  Allows for multiple players, so others can get in on the fun as well.
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B005KC664W 5 1376697600 61 This is a basic Sudoku game that takes little space, plays smooth without eating up resources and is a great way to kill time even if you don't like Sudoku.  That'd include endless hours waiting for appointments and other things you'd rather not be doing! LOLEasy interface, has basic gameplay but also keeps up with you as you become more advanced.
A13FS8L1H9CL5L B00DJFIMW6 3 1376697600 64 You'll get it just to see what the Minions are up to now...But you'll need a hotter CPU/GPU to run it as it's big, overbearing and intense on resources.  It's great to play, but it has in-app purchases galore that'll nail you continually even if you play to the point you don't need them.  Good gameplay though and as always the Minions are hilarious!!
A13FT238AOLM5F B004SBS8LA 5 1366761600 73 I love all the Angry bird games.  Once I start I can't stop!  I am always trying to beat myself.  My son downloaded on my Kindle and I told him that was a stupid game. But once I played it I couldn't stop. So then I added all the rest of the Angry Bird games. Definately recommend getting these games. And free is nice, too. I have all of the Angry Bird games.
A13FT238AOLM5F B006HXXJH0 5 1375228800 21 Fun and easy to identify when playing and it's free! I like to play easy games at night before falling asleep
A13FT238AOLM5F B00AV8YANY 5 1366761600 130 I cannot believe I lived without my Kindle!!! I took it to Australia for a month. Used it on the air plane & ship. It kept me connected to friends & family.  I'll be 61 yrs old and it's extremely easy to use.  There was only 2 things that were confusing at first, but my kids showed me and that was the end of it. But if you have an I-Phone you'd know how to use apps, which I don't.  So apps were a little confusing to me at first. If you are hesitating to buying it - don't be!!! Just buy it!!! You will love it, too. I got the 8.9 so I'd have a bigger screen cause as you get older the bigger the better. LOL LOL LOL
A13FT238AOLM5F B009HQ9UHC 5 1369785600 25 Love this game.  It really challenges you! A lot different than Angry Birds. I think I like it better cause it makes you think more.
A13FT238AOLM5F B00869HEJ2 5 1380412800 32 I really like playing this game.  It is very much like original Solitaire, but it automatically moves cards to the top for you, which makes it much faster and easy to play.
A13FT238AOLM5F B004SJ3AXI 5 1366761600 65 I love all the Angry bird games.  Once I start I can't stop!  I am always trying to beat myself.  My son downloaded on my Kindle and I told him that was a stupid game. But once I played it I couldn't stop. So then I added all the rest of the Angry Bird games. Definately recommend getting these games. And free is nice, too.
A13FT238AOLM5F B007N5YIUS 5 1366761600 55 I love all the Angry bird games.  Once I start I can't stop!  I am always trying to beat myself.  My son downloaded on my Kindle and I told him that was a stupid game. But once I played it I couldn't stop. So then I added all the rest of the Angry Bird games.
A13FWQKUSOLKHG B008Y0REKC 5 1379116800 31 I love the little monsters there soooooo cute love how you get to feed them and play with them. The only problem is that you have to buy more monster berries
A13FWQKUSOLKHG B00992CF6W 5 1379030400 41 I love this game its the best. Its TOTALLY WORTH 7$ My little girl will make houses and love it and play on it for hours and never get bored she plays it all day and all night GET THIS APP
A13FXRPRFFYGX4 B005KC664W 5 1358380800 35 ..........Love, love it fun relaxing game.  Very easy to learn and to play.I have a small book of Sudoku that I keep in my purse for those times you have to wait in offices etc.McCabe
A13FXV0SQ3E6N0 B0064X7FVE 5 1358640000 25 I really like this,I have it on my kindle.Ilike being able to quikly check the weather whenever I want to without waiting for the tv.
A13FXV0SQ3E6N0 B007SYXJ2C 5 1364515200 23 love it,very challenging.I like the idea that you can do the same level over again if you want to try to do better.
A13FXV0SQ3E6N0 B0066T0BTO 5 1364515200 40 I love this game,I play it all the time,as a matter of fact I lose track of time when I play.I just wish I knew how many levels there are,i'm on level 58 now. I reccommend this game to anyone.
A13G0CNMTVFX3R B00CKW6FVE 4 1370044800 22 this is a fun game! How ever I wish there was a free play mode so your not always racing the clock
A13G0CNMTVFX3R B00CX9P6V4 4 1373760000 20 this is a fun game to kill time. It needs more photos. great game for kids. will recommend to others.
A13G0CNMTVFX3R B0088Y7YHW 4 1347235200 27 this game is fun when I want to kill time. How ever it seems to force close a lot and the spin wheel is slow at times.
A13G0H2LAEAANE B00CMMR9SU 5 1380067200 21 I love this game - I spend many hours playing. I get challenged in every game and I love the colors!
A13G0H2LAEAANE B00DHKKN6Q 5 1395273600 36 This game is lots of fun' you have to develop skills to get all of the balls down. I enjoy hours of fun and I love the colors. for a free game you can't go wrong.
A13G0H2LAEAANE B00E8W4HQE 2 1392249600 33 This is not that exciting, not that much fun, there is nothing to think about, not using anything but your finger to spin. You have to be a real slots junky for this.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B0063M22QO 5 1380931200 23 Fairly easy to do. May take a little time to master it, but it's a lot of fun and a great time waster.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B004SRLB1I 5 1387324800 22 Talking Tom,Liked so much,I'm thinking of collecting all the &#34;talkers&#34;. Really great when you need a little &#34;pickup&#34; on a down day.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B008910NAO 5 1362528000 22 More fun than a barrel monkeys. I do enjoy all the games this app has. There's something for just about every one.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B0063HB1HU 1 1380931200 32 Nothing more than a subscription app. I think all these apps should be titled as such. It would save a lot of time on your customers part who are expecting something more.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B00FAX6XQC 3 1387324800 47 Yes, I've reached age of reason. Can't see out my left eye and blind in my other eye,and on top of that to lazy to drag a real deer out of the woods and throw it up on my car rack. This way is so much easier.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B00AOA9BL0 5 1402012800 34 Works very well, I have cable and wireless hookup. The picture is great, you can watch regular programing but you will still have to pay for the &#34;premium&#34; channels&#34; marked with a little key.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B00AQL8VU4 5 1380758400 34 Still playing around with my Kindle HD, so I can't give a definative answer to this rating. I'm sure Amazon doesn't stray to far from offering a great product at a very reasonable price.
A13G348WU1CBB2 B00AFCEIB0 5 1362528000 28 Very good search board, just slightly slower than Bing. But still very good app. I liked it because I was a Google fan for a long, long time.
A13G5I201UDZSP B00820STKI 5 1338854400 28 when I saw this I was curious but now I am hooked always loved fireworks as a kid. I tjonl you will fond it a lot of fun.
A13G5I201UDZSP B006E4QCXU 5 1329264000 31 I picked this app up after trying it out. I can get lost in it for hours and not be bored with it. It's a relaxing way to spend the time.
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B00FYHXMQS 5 1395273600 53 I love match 3 games. I finished all the levels in the first game so I was glad they made a second one. I like the different challenges on each board. I can play this game for hours. I also like that you have the option to skip levels when you get stuck
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B00F8L2VO4 4 1390867200 70 I used to be a fluent Spanish speaker but since I haven't spoken it in years I lost it. I plan to be a bilingual counselor, speaking both English and Spanish. This app makes learning another language feel more like a game than work. I like how each session builds on the previous session. I think this is a good app for children who are trying to learn another language.
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B008IXP8IU 4 1365206400 21 This is an original word game. I'm hooked! I can see myself playing this game for hours. It's fun and educational.
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B00CKW6FVE 5 1369872000 41 I just started playing this game and I can't put it down. This is a great spin on one of the best games ever. Tetris is a timeless game and EA has bought it into the new millennium. I love it!
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B00CO6TOBY 4 1380672000 37 I have always loved Tetris. This version of it is pretty good. I can spend hours playing it. I am a little confused about how to play the worlds but I'm sure I will figure it out.
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B00KOEHQCW 5 1405296000 25 I play Frozen Free Fall and this game is even better than that one. I like the different ways to win each level. love it!
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B006VW94HQ 4 1368403200 27 This game keeps me entertained for hours. It's a simple game but it makes you think. I could play for hours and not get bored. I'm addicted!
A13G7VPBIVSKDK B00E4WVYR8 5 1381276800 40 I was put off by the name of this game. Once I started playing I couldn't put it down. It is fun to play and it makes your brain work. I love getting a perfect and beating the world average.
A13G8CO205TAXW B004SCG69A 5 1329091200 27 tank hero is one of my favorite games in the whole world. I can play this game all day. Even my friends Jared and Madie love it.
A13G8WA9B9VLJP B004RJMUJO 4 1350604800 47 This is a hood game but after awhile it becomes tedious. I guess there is a limit on how many fruit I can slice and still be entertained.The game and graphics are good. The sounds are great and it is fun to earn different blades and backgrounds.
A13G8WA9B9VLJP B00910Y1OQ 5 1352073600 61 Most of these games are fairly interchangeable but I really enjoyed this one because it the graphics are great and the progressive difficulty made it enjoyable. The music did get a bit repetitive but the controls to turn it off were simple. I played this games straight thru twice and I still play it when I need a little down time.
A13G8WA9B9VLJP B008MEM24S 5 1348099200 81 I have never seen Phineas and Ferb but I love this game. The lasers drive my nuts trying to figure them out but once I do I get excited. This is one of the few games that I don't seek out help on defeating a level.It would be nice if Disney would update the game quicker but seeing as I don't have to pay for little ad ons (I am looking at you Where's My Water) it is a minor concession.
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B008JJ7XYK 5 1361145600 49 this game is very fun and cute... my mom is always telling me to give her kindle back lol this is a really good game you should get it and no you dont always need gems just breed other monsters to try to make the one you want :)
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B007OXASB2 4 1372204800 32 This is a good game if you're willing to spend real money on it. It will rob you blind. But other than that it is a pretty good game. I loved it.
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B0091937MO 4 1351468800 56 this is basically like happy poo jump but with ice cream... the only thing is my friend has this on her phone too and she has a store on it and shes on a droid I'm on a kindle and I dont have a store I thing that's stupid that's why I gave it 4 starts
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B00DJYC55C 5 1393113600 38 all those rumors saying that there is a pedophile hiding behide the camera are lies. Come on people do you really believe everything you hear on the Internet. my friends and I were on it and nothing happened..
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B00A3NQNUU 4 1392336000 40 so I had almost all the dragons. I needed like 7 more that I know of. I opened the app one day and I was back to the beginning to level 1. I was mad, I'm restarting anyway though ;-;
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B00A3WTXQ2 5 1361145600 23 this game is fun for all ages... I'm 14 and I love it great for the kindle fire and other devices too :)
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B00B2V66VS 5 1361145600 21 this is even better than the first temple run if you liked the origional than you will love this one :)
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B0069G5Z9K 5 1380412800 31 I had this app for a long time. ever since I got my kindle. I love it! its fun for all ages. I'm 14 and I'm addicted. someone send help please...
A13GA4PUSYJJZ3 B008J1ZVRY 1 1381104000 39 This app isn't anything special. Not worth even just a dollar. It's just another copy of the original Temple Run you can get for free. except Temple Run is WAY better than this.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B00A6GNC1M 5 1399680000 25 Can't beat anything that is free.  Graphics are great, it has just enough variety to keep it interesting.  You can't go wrong with this one.
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B00CJ77HU8 5 1371772800 26 My son found me playing this and wanted to try it right away.  He loves it, it's challenging for young and old.  Best thing it's free!!!!!!!!
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B00CB2837W 4 1371772800 21 Kids will like this, it's not for small kids though.  It's okay for a free game.  Good to take on trips.
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B00B5KHZA2 5 1371772800 23 Some of the items are really hard to find they are hidden so will.  That makes it pretty good for a free game.
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B00HHBXYGM 5 1399680000 25 Love the free games!!!!  This one has great graphics and is fast paced.  If you like the match 3 games you will like this one.
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B0080H2TFE 5 1371772800 20 If you like numbers this is a fast pace game for you.  You can play this on trips.  Love this!!
A13GDMRO1MBRFB B00A4EZ3QS 4 1371772800 22 Not the classic candy crush, interesting though.  Not as easy as the classic.  It's free so it's worth trying, at least once.
A13GDPUC7ZBKH3 B00COVCV50 3 1376006400 28 I like this game very much.  It is a great way to relax in the evening after a long day a work.  I would definitely recommend this game.
A13GDPUC7ZBKH3 B005SE8IFW 4 1381622400 22 A neat app for playing with changing your photos.  Not a professional app but still fun.  I would recommend this for anyone
A13GEY5VKC686Y B007XKEY6Q 5 1341878400 40 add me lillexi910 for that person that thought. that u needed a password for facebook or email, well u don't, u need an account password just in case if u logout or play ur account on a different system FUN'!!!!!!!!
A13GEY5VKC686Y B00AEORXR0 3 1365379200 69 The game was fine until I needed the update. They reccomended me to get the update from Google Play, but on my kindle fire (not hd) it wont allow me to use google play since amazon is an available choice. When I went on Amazon, they said the update was available but it just lead me to the normal store which said &quot;open&quot; when the app wasn't updated. HELP!
A13GEY5VKC686Y B004Z9Y3VY 5 1338163200 40 gees peoples, this is meant as a joke. and if you are mad at it fir saying hell then loosen up. I grew up with my family saying that word and even worse stuff. this game is fun.me gusta queso
A13GEY5VKC686Y B004SJ3AXI 5 1325721600 22 ohmigosh this game is so fun! I play it all of the time and cant resist playing. is the 20 words already?
A13GF7O8FGKTHD B00E8KLWB4 5 1385683200 37 Like the length of play and the challenge of this game.  I have spent a small amount of additional money bit only a couple dollars  Fare cost for such a good, challenging, and fun game. Well done
A13GF7O8FGKTHD B00I3WTXCS 4 1396569600 36 The game turned out to be quite good.  I was unsure if I would like it at the beginning but it was a fun story and challenging to figure all the tasks out.  Worth the purchase.
A13GF7O8FGKTHD B00CT9ZVGI 4 1379462400 28 The storyline is good, puzzles good some a little easy but overall very good game. Look forward to each new room.  Buy this one it is worth it.
A13GF7O8FGKTHD B00EL71DR2 4 1378598400 47 Good graphics.  Liked the story and way you went from scene to scene to complete the game.  My only issue was physically going from screen  to screen the icon was often too close to the inventory icon and it was sometimes hard to activate.  Overall great play.
A13GHPG4YZC14Q B00DJFIMW6 5 1391904000 53 My grandson loves the Despicable Me movies for one reason and one reason only. The minions! Those little yellow creatures that are obsessed with bananas are delightfully funny, and it's nice to see them come to life in this game! Not too hard, a little tricky, but not too hard for my grandson!
A13GHPG4YZC14Q B00BIK524A 5 1391904000 38 This game is just fantastic! Words cannot describe how amazing I think this app is. This is one app that I just do not want to put down! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Mahjong games!
A13GHPG4YZC14Q B00EW3STPY 5 1391904000 35 My grandson absolutely loves the Caillou television series and this game is just the icing on the cake! This game keeps him entertained for hours! Which is hard to accomplish with a four year old!
A13GJQJUHXOZF1 B006D1ONE4 5 1330128000 23 kids love this game my three year old cant get enough of it. looking forward to more levels and more ridiculous Gator antics.
A13GJQJUHXOZF1 B004HEORNQ 5 1329264000 28 great up to date information in a seconds notice. I never thought I would of been a twitter follower but I thoroughly enjoy it. Thank you twitter creator
A13GJQJUHXOZF1 B007PTJOV0 5 1333929600 21 good game awesome play style taking ol school back to the new age. leps world is great for kids and adults
A13GJQJUHXOZF1 B007PT3QOQ 5 1333929600 26 love it love it loved &quot;it love's it good stuff amazing good game so awesome so sweet kids love it like they love cake or candy
A13GJW6XAIOEOI B00AXKPWSM 1 1383091200 29 Never used it because kindle only has a front facing camera.  The kindle camera is poor quality.  I'm undecided about whether I can even use this app with kindle
A13GK66EVIVMU8 B00DHKKN6Q 5 1386288000 28 I THINK THIS is the most challenging bubbles game yet...is a little hard to sir and shoot st first but don't long to get the hang of it
A13GK66EVIVMU8 B00AR1AUAW 4 1372723200 21 Seems hard but is challenging....is fun though. Ok am having a hard time but still enjoying it. Also learning as well.
A13GK66EVIVMU8 B00BUB9JDW 5 1380067200 24 Ok  is very fun but challenging. It sure keeps you playing  and not wanting to stop. Best game I've played in a long time.
A13GODQ53SMDCE B00HY9UK28 5 1392163200 26 Love this game. It's so addictive and fun.I'm glad it's modern day music on the game. It's fun for all ages and passes the time away...thanks
A13GODQ53SMDCE B00CMF27DE 5 1368921600 21 I really love this bingo game. it keeps me entertained for hours at a time... cant. seem put it down !
A13GODQ53SMDCE B00D5YT6IA 5 1372982400 21 this game is really amazing and keeps me entertained for hours on end. I recommend this game for everyone to enjoy.
A13GODQ53SMDCE B0081IRIKI 5 1391731200 20 Awesome game..it's very addictive game. I could play for hours at a time. Really nice machines to choose from.love it
A13GOXJKGVTFCI B00IK1NTCW 5 1404259200 8 Looks great but I haven't used it yet.
A13GOXJKGVTFCI B00BJ7PY86 5 1404259200 2 Fav game
A13GOYDCWM38RM B0058P7KUA 1 1310515200 20 the narative uses profantity in the intro.  the game is just running around and killing people.  not safe for kids
A13GP5G131R72J B004VOJT0I 4 1358294400 23 this app gives you recipes to just about any/everything;from food to drinks this app is one of the best on app store..love it!!!
A13GP5G131R72J B004GWRMWC 4 1342051200 57 this app is very helpful when looking for a home.it allows u to put an address in of the home u want to view and some may even have pictures for u to view the Inside and outside of the homes. it gives u the sale Prices and how much it is worth in renting and buying.
A13GP5G131R72J B007KPOZK4 3 1342051200 57 I was having fun with this game until it just went out one day and I had to start all over from being broke again. I had work so hard to get to were I was and for the game to just start me all the way Bk over was just a. bummer so I uninstalled it
A13GP5G131R72J B004H2MGOU 5 1369440000 20 I even put the level on hard....its fun especially when there is nothing else to do....love it for kindle fire.
A13GP5G131R72J B006AZZPCM 3 1392422400 34 This app is slow as hell, it works when it wants to work. And when it is working it takes alll day to download on my kindle. This app needs a serious up grade!!!
A13GP5G131R72J B004HXHVZ8 5 1397520000 41 love this app it gives me accurate information and is updated frequently. This app is very helpful; it lets you know what's playing and what's coming soon in the future;such as movies that will be coming out in 2016-17. Yes awesome!!
A13GP5G131R72J B004KU5LHS 5 1392422400 122 I have been using this app for 2yrs.plus. Its accurate (according to my OBGYN) as long as you set it according to the way your body operates. It will give you the average options but everyone is not average so if you don't change from average it will tell you how your body should be operating; meaning....if your period starts on may 3rd the app will schedule for your period to end in the next 3 days and that will cause  your ovalation days to be off track on calendar it provides for you. Especially if you know your period  lasts more than 3days. So that's why its important to go to settings and reset everything (if your period is not average).
A13GP5G131R72J B00FYHXMQS 5 1392422400 30 This is the only game app I use on all of my devices. I download it on every device I get. Love it play! it everywhere especially when I'm bord.
A13GP5G131R72J B004UID2LC 4 1342051200 20 allows me to download wut ever video I want to see and I can play again when ever I want
A13GR1WITSRW3Y B00DUGCLY4 5 1405036800 21 This game is really fun. You should give it a try. It is free.  Have a fun time playing this game.
A13GR1WITSRW3Y B00AREIAI8 4 1379808000 25 Fun game. I am 13 and I still think it's fun. The only thing I wish was that you could earn money and energy faster.
A13GR1WITSRW3Y B0086700CM 5 1338336000 25 this is a fun game expesly to pass time the only thing I would change is sometimes when u jump or slide it don't respond
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B004N2NWQ0 2 1375401600 39 It's just too easy. No point to it really. Except if you pretend it's extremely hard and you impress everyone bu completing it first try, but make sure not to let them study it too hard, it's too easy.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B006UJMHD8 2 1375401600 40 Extremely easy just like all the other moron tests. I won the first time I tried and there's just no point to getting this unless you say it's really hard and impress your friends by completing it first time around.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B006HVARCC 3 1375401600 51 Overall it's fun for kids but if you want to use something that is really fun and actually sort of realistic, this is not the app for you. I thought it was going to be somewhat like paint on the computer, but it's nothing like that and actually kind of boring.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B0071PARPA 3 1375401600 88 Well, this app is.... Interesting... That's all I can really say about it. But the fact that you can actually do some pretty realistic things is fantastic! Before you get this app, consider how artistic you are first. If you're going to spend a large amount of time drawing and would like to experiment with color mixtures and weird tools, then this is the app for you. If you would rather spend time doing small doodles with one color or so, consider getting something a little more basic.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B00AO0JH0K 5 1358467200 29 I love this mainly because you start to think more of things that you may have forgot without it. It challenges your mind more. It is sooo amazingly addictive!
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B004K4RY9M 4 1375401600 25 Finding the words isn't the problem. The real hard part of this game is beating your's and other people's records. Very amusing and time consuming!
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B008JK6W5K 4 1344816000 42 I thought this game was fun and very addictive. I had trouble with the spelling of some logos but other than a few minor things its a great app. I recommend it to people who like puzzles, mind games, and brain teasers.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B007SYDYLS 5 1354147200 31 This app is sooooo addicting! I love it. You definitly have to think about things HARD!!! And if you don't get something right... its all about rearranging things! It's sooooo fun!!!!!
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B008XG1X18 4 1352505600 50 personally i love this app... but i cant figure out how to delete boards... i accidently made a board that u didnt want to make and cant figure out how to delete it... but other than that its really COOL!! i love pinterest!!!!!! Get the app its cheap and fun!!!!!
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B00AM5JTV4 3 1375401600 48 Overall, this game is easy to figure out. The first time I tried it I won. So just not very challenging and not very fun. It claims to work out your brain but it really doesn't. You barely even have to think about what's going on to win.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B005X9498M 1 1375401600 25 You can't do anything but look at a single screen. You can't swipe to a new one and you can't interact with it at all.
A13GSOIBQ2M06E B007XKEY6Q 4 1358467200 32 It was soooo super cool until one day i clicked on it to play it again and then it would not work. So it's great for overall experience but it crashes sometimes.
A13GSTOKWNXCM5 B00EBE8MUG 3 1382054400 28 Too bad you can't skip a puzzle you have no way of solving. If you have that happen you are done and will have to delete this app.
A13GSTOKWNXCM5 B008NMT684 2 1389830400 46 Only 4 puzzles are free and were easily mastered by my 3-year old grandson.  To download any more puzzles of this venue requires a cash payment--easier to buy puzzles at Walmart that are a little more challenging.  Would not recommend getting taken by the &#34;free&#34; description.
A13GZIHK3YNCO B00FWPWNKS 4 1389398400 22 Has lots of levels and obstacles to keep you engaged.  Love playing the game and racking up the points!  Glad I purchased.
A13GZIHK3YNCO B00GTGSEW0 5 1389398400 24 I know this is just a match 3 game but it has kept me busy for months!  I am glad I purchased the game.
A13H12FDGT7DHV B004R13U6Y 5 1306195200 69 I had adobe pdf which is supposed to read pdf's well it doesn't but this one does just like pdf x for my computer . believe me I never pay for aps but I did this one and I'm so thankful because it actually works unlike the adobe reader... If you are wondering if you need this app wonder no more just get it, it's well worth the price.....
A13H12FDGT7DHV B006KX3GXO 5 1337817600 37 I like the app but can't find a way to access my gallery after picking a frame or collage...:( it only accesses by what it sees ..need to add a way to change directories.....Motorola Droid Razr Maxx
A13H12FDGT7DHV B007BFSYMS 2 1358985600 61 I was excited when I saw that this was the free app today as I like this sort of thing a lot and purchasing all of the different ones to find the right one can be a bit daunting. However, I was a bit down by the fact that there seems to be no way to play more than one sound.
A13H12FDGT7DHV B0052UZIFA 5 1313712000 52 It is one the most played game on my phone right alongside angry birds and fieldrunners...oh and chuzzle...that goes for me my mother and my son... phones and tablets old and new alike...for the guy who keeps losing progress maybe it's the way YOU... exit my right year old has no problems.....
A13H12FDGT7DHV B00846I1Y4 1 1350604800 60 Motorola Droid RAZR Maxx.  the app downloaded and installed fine however when you open it you can choose the song the animal and see the keys on the keyboard play but no music comes out...Thanks are you did was make my 2 year old cry.. That one..that one ... about wanting to play an app that doesn't work...Uninstalled... Nuff said
A13H12FDGT7DHV B009DRL9YM 2 1349568000 62 I really liked this game but I refuse to give any game that requires in app purchases anything more than 2 yes two stars ... So I suppose you should be happy you got the top but that's the best you will get from me... You can't even buy leaf's with gold you have to pay cash and that's bad all bad....
A13H12FDGT7DHV B004M6B1NI 5 1314835200 28 Cute little helpful app.. I have been using it forever however the update will not apply otherwise great little app use it almost every day..especially for redbox coupons..haha
A13H12FDGT7DHV B00881VLCE 1 1339459200 75 Talk about a game where you feel like your all thumbs, and the controls are blotchy at best I liked the tigers of ask threes things it said you can do,  but since it didn't respond to touch all I can guess is the calibration is no good get it fixed and I well change my rating till then I have uninstalled it, as who need a game on their phone that they can't play....
A13H12FDGT7DHV B0067Q42BY 1 1329696000 20 Too bad it has ads :( not fair in a paid app............................ Please fix and I will update my review.....
A13H4A3L1O828J B00892MNI8 5 1346112000 21 I think its cool. but its not cool because you have to wait 8 hrs for your zombie to revive itself
A13H4A3L1O828J B008FETAQS 5 1342396800 21 Greta but you thiouf should have us revive monehd dvdhd beheld dbdhdhd d dud d the red tkt is very cool
A13H4A3L1O828J B007U7IKVM 5 1336521600 21 this game is really cool but could need some more weapon and cool other stufff andto be awesome awesome awwsome awesome
A13H4A3L1O828J B00BR4QNJ0 5 1367020800 44 This game is amazing you have so many choices to have allies to fight beside you in battle and in defense . The only thing that sucks is that you need to buy coins to further upgrade your allies into stronger and better allies
A13H4A3L1O828J B0087DXGIU 5 1340064000 26 I think its great. but you should give us more. kinds of weapons to attack them with like catapults or something like boiling oil or trolls
A13H4A3L1O828J B00E7VV2RS 5 1388275200 22 It's very interesting but bad with updates lately whenever I try to update it immediately forces me out of the darn game.
A13H4A3L1O828J B00E994GPI 1 1398729600 58 Don't play this when you get up to 500 you get placed with people at 1000 and up end there's so much lag you can't win its impossible I was over 700 and it put me with 1000 and way up and I got demoted to 500 and it still did it to me don't play this game.
A13H5L2ESXR2KB B0054JZC6E 5 1330905600 61 It is a great game. It has a lot of games like it says. It gives you points for the littlest things. Like if you fail a game five times. Or if you just play the game the next day it gives you five thousand points. BTW that is not a lot of points. I really think you should get it.
A13H5L2ESXR2KB B004GVYXTS 2 1327190400 23 I'm ten and even easy is hard I don't recomend it for kids my age but,other than that it is a great app.
A13H5L2ESXR2KB B00846GKTW 5 1337644800 25 It is awesome!!!!!!! U get to style ur own model! They get to choose the style but it's sooooo easy. U really should get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A13H69MYG03P2Y B008B0S0XK 5 1339804800 21 this has to be one of the best games ever made.  there is no possible way anyone could hate this game.
A13H69MYG03P2Y B00992CF6W 3 1347580800 33 i love minecraft, but $7 is too much for a pocket edition, there were already free copies that replaced this, like block story.  ill settle for $5, but this is still pretty expensive
A13H69MYG03P2Y B008JJM88Q 5 1370390400 20 ive been waiting to get a gift card to get it but now its free, it can guess almost anything
A13H69MYG03P2Y B008LG021M 5 1357776000 23 I use it to procrastinate all the time, its fun.  the only problem is upgrades are hard to get. -20word reviews are annoying
A13H69MYG03P2Y B00AB7HESI 5 1366848000 27 I always loved scribblenauts, but I wasted too much money on mjnecraft(which I barely even use) so I cant get this until I get another gift card
A13H69MYG03P2Y B007U8JRWW 4 1350172800 26 I like being able to control the cameras, but it is hard to find interesting cameras, some r blank.  just to be sure, is this legal?
A13H69MYG03P2Y B00AA0TOG6 4 1355529600 32 looks like a mixture of drawn to life (a nintendo ds game, I give it 3*) and scribblenauts (the best game ever).  ill happily take this, but we need a scribblenauts app
A13H69MYG03P2Y B006OC2ANS 5 1330387200 26 it is pretty easy, but there are a lot of levels.  it runs great on my kindle fire and I haven't found a problem with it
A13H6BLWC6IGOX B00632HWOG 4 1359936000 33 good app.  i have it on my android phone and felt the need to also put it on my kindle.  the app is much easier than using the web browser for the device.
A13H6BLWC6IGOX B004HXHVZ8 4 1359590400 23 I have this app on my android so i thought I get it for my kindle as well.  Nice set up, good info.
A13H6BLWC6IGOX B004SJ3BCI 4 1359590400 21 This was a fun app.  It is better to play on my kindle than on my cell...but i'm so over it.
A13H6BLWC6IGOX B005AKD836 5 1376870400 37 Already had this app on my android phone.  This kindle one works the same.  Haven't had any unexpected errors.  While it's not as fully available and easy to navigate as the website, it's still a good app.
A13H6BLWC6IGOX B0089BPEZS 3 1360800000 24 the app works fine.  It's just another video app.  works fine and is pretty user friendly.  I don't use it too much anymore though.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B00AIQP9DE 4 1371686400 25 Felt like I spent 15 minutes downloading and an hour playing. Fun while it lasted. Essentially the game is a commercial for the pay version.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B006U4891C 4 1390867200 52 I always wanted to be &#34;untypical&#34; as an American and actually know something about the world. This quiz app is a reasonably good motivator to crack the books and search the internet. It may, at times, become frustrating when one must admit not knowing the answer to several questions in a row.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B004GYY714 4 1384214400 51 The only thing that falls short of &#34;perfection&#34; is that stations tend to cut out after about thirty minutes, and sometimes I have had to tune to another one. I would prefer, when listening to German radio, to be able to receive the broadcast version, but overall I am very satisfied.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B004FRX0MY 4 1390867200 74 I may be wrong, but it seems one needs their propitiatory downloader and I've had occasional problems with getting it out of the cloud and into my computer. I am not chained to a smart phone, but use a desktop and a laptop computer .. and my Kindle. Nice to be able to access it, but I've been lost rather often when searching for where on my device Amazon decided to download the song.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B00CMMR9SU 2 1390867200 24 It's OK, I guess. But even with the Kindle Fire HDX screen, it is not my cup of tea. Gave it an honest try.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B004UID2LC 2 1390867200 22 Long download times, pauses, glitches... it was OK for my older first generation Kindle, but I prefer to go to the website.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B004TI2ZXY 2 1390867200 32 I am frustrated from seeking a decent world atlas application. This is another one of those map apps where you can get about the same quality from a fifth grade geography book.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B004SOR4H6 2 1390867200 33 Since I'm not a Smart Phone user and don';t think that every moment of my life.... or anyone else's life.... is that fascinating, I may simply not appreciate what Twitter has to offer.
A13H8U1LGGSTYE B00BXPQN2K 3 1390867200 37 I'm always willing to try something that is attractively presented. I prefer games that take a little more thought. This is another of those games where one has to keep up with the times and the computer.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B008BBB388 2 1365552000 67 DO NOT!!! Purchase this game if you have a kindle fire.  I'm very upset that I was unable to get the last blue peg from the right hand middle of the screen.  It's really partly my fault for not reading the reviews of other people who had this same problem.  I have nothing else to say about this game that would be positive.I want my money back....
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B0064TVQ5E 5 1353715200 28 This game is very enjoying. Once I git the hang of the screens with 4 sets of tiles I was on the roll.  I also like the music...
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00BNH1PF8 5 1363046400 55 I just downloaded this app, so far I like it.  It takes some brain work to figure out what the word would be by comparing all four pictures.  When I initially started I was stuck and I kept going back and noticed how the letters would change.  All in all this is a great app.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00JF8Z1NO 5 1397606400 24 Good slots game.  Interrupting game ads are a little annoying though.  Other than that the music is relaxing and overall a good slot game.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00BG3ID0Y 4 1363910400 81 This app will surely make you use your brain.  You really have to think outsideof the box. For some reason I have to leave it and come back to it to figure out theword.  The diagrams given are clear and concise, but it still doesn't click in my brain.  Not all of them, just some of them.  Someone that enjoys puzzles in the line of crosswords would do well with this puzzle.  I recommend this puzzle game forages 9 &amp; up.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00IIOFVYA 5 1395792000 44 Although my review won't be as long and detailed as the others I really like this hog.  It's pretty straightforward,.  The storyline is not as annoying as some others that I have played.  Overall, I like this one and have not encountered any problems.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00AHUEUGS 5 1359763200 45 I really had a good time with this game.  It was pretty interesting to me.  The different types of things that you need to do, such as finding the red cups and putting coffee in the cup then putting sugar squares into the coffee.  Interesting....
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00A4KVFLY 4 1396051200 53 This game is very closely related to the tv show.  I recommend it as a fun, entertaining game show app.  It does move a little too fast for me but I've only played two rounds before I was asked to give a review.  I'll update this review after I play for awhile longer.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B0091REZMW 3 1363305600 61 I'm just getting started and it ask to rate the app so soon.  So, as for now it appears to be a good app.  I gave it a 3 because of not quite getting into it.  I will come back and give a complete review once I get deeper into it.  It's still a little confusing right now.  Be back soon.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B008JJS6D2 4 1356393600 23 I really got hooked the other day until I was shut down because I refuse to purchase coins. It's fun other than that.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B009VSW15Y 5 1354924800 21 I love this app which you need to open the camera on the kindle fire.  pictures are clear.  Would definitely recommend.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00GGQLZUG 5 1388448000 82 This is the best slot game/s ever.  You are able to progress onto the next level fairly quick.  The graphics are crisp and beautiful to look at.  I also enjoy the music on each of the ones that I have acquired.  I'm currently on level 21 I think because I have 3 other slot games on my Kindle Fire but this one is by far the best one of them all.  For those of you who love slots, get into the action.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00ATPVA78 4 1357948800 41 I really like this app. Although I have not reached the end of the game so far I'm enjoying the suspense of reaching the next level. It is a little different from other hidden object games, that makes it more fun.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00GXH3TGG 4 1393545600 47 Makes you feel like you are playing the slots in las Vegas.  SOUNDS ARE GOOD TOO.  The only drawback is when you are betting for say $60 you may not win anything or just win $4.00.  So corny with that aspect.  Other than that I'm enjoying playing.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00H2BJ7HC 4 1391212800 83 I gave this app a four because if you didn't have so many spins that you don't win anything it would have been a big 5 .  I counted the spins that didn't win and there are far too many that you win nothing.  Over ten spins is really unfair.  I like the graphics and the time to unlock a new game wasn't too long but again it's the amount of spins that you don't win.  Far too many spins and no wins.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00H2I9F4U 1 1396828800 45 I really like this game but it's stuck.  After reading the reviews of others now I see.  Such a shame because I was having a good time.  Oh well, it has to be deleted.  Can't have it taking up space on my Kindle.  Bye, bye
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B009LGKCS4 5 1370563200 111 At first I was confused of how the words should combine together but now I have the hang of it.  It really makes you use your brain.  Good one, kudos to the creator of this game.  It's becomes very addictive as well.  I have to sometimes stop playing and go back to it later.  I'm still making my way through the easy ones, up to the 26th level.  Have had to refresh on the same level quite a few times which is a good feature, don't know what I would have done on some of them if it didn't have the refresh to another set.  I would definitely recommend this game.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00I3WTXCS 5 1397174400 79 Weird Park: Scary Tales is the best game of this realm that I have played so far.  I have played one other game that has been this great and I've played quite a few.  The game is long too. Graphics are wonderful.  I'm almost finished and actually wish that it could go on.  Really, it's the best.  It's also funny how Mr. Dudley keeps taking the children that are found.  It was well worth the money.  Check it out.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00HTKA4N2 5 1394323200 43 Love this game.  Pretty relaxing as well.  Having a problem unlocking it but I'll get that figured out soon enough.  As someone else mentioned, it's a perfect game for beginners but although I'm a seasoned player of this type, I'm still enjoying it.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00B03IY90 5 1364256000 58 I really enjoyed this game.  Just finished the story.  It took me awhile as I have other games on my Kindle and I switch back and forth when I get stuck.  This game is real adventure you have to play it.  I would like more like this with the hidden objects encircled within the rings.  Adventurous and fun.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B007V5CF5K 5 1366070400 76 I love this game... it appears that I only have two more scenes to go through.I'm having so much fun with this.  I don't want it to end.  Alawar, you have to make more just like this.  This game has kept me so occupied.  It's a lot of scenes, and then there's the mirror scenes.  I've been playing for awhile too.  I like that.  Please make more like this, it's the best.Thank you for this one
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00F9ZO3Z4 5 1393804800 20 Good payout, entertaining levels.  Takes awhile to get to the next set of slot play but fun all in all.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00E616R5Q 4 1385510400 104 I've been playing this game for a week now.  Have a lot of money in the bank.  The only thing that's funny is with the five reels.  When you get a. Scatter on the first reel then a scatter on the second reel, how does the people in the background know that you are not going to get the scatter on the third, fourth or fifth reel by saying awww before the reels even stop?  It's a funny thing to me because that automatically tells me that it's set-up for it not to stop on either the 3rd, 4th or 5th reel.  Go figure
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00KFNXUY0 3 1404432000 135 Why do this to people?  I really like this app.  Only gave it three stars because everything is not about Facebook in my opinion.  I don't like to ask my friends and family to play a game because I chose to play a game and vice versus.  Why??, Why????, Why?  This really is an interesting game.  I've been playing it everyday, off and on.  It keeps me occupied for a good amount of time too.  With that said, I'll probably be deleting this one pretty soon.  You game designers need to put yourself in the mindset of the people who will install and play the games and see if it would be something that would irritate you if the shoe was on the other foot.  I'm quite sure you would design it a little different.
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00F0VLN2S 5 1383436800 100 I really enjoy the game so far.  Unlike one of the reviews that I read, I had no problems whatsoever with the combination lock puzzle or any of the others.  Although the game is not a true hidden object game it's interesting.  I like the fact boxes which give you a little bit of historical data.  I love hidden object games with a complex style to it and the storyline as well but all in all I really am having fun playing this one.  If possible I will finish this review after I complete the game.Will send my final thoughts.Dee
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B00702PZME 5 1353801600 34 This is the kind of game that everyone older than 50 should be playing.The reason is that our brains should be kept busy as we age to deter Alzeimers or Dementia....Great game...get it today...
A13HCH3I2G3DSV B0063IH60K 5 1368144000 28 Solitaire is an all time favorite.  The creators of this particular app has done a great job.  Good job.  I play this game on my Kindle Fire everyday.
A13HCXFRJ1WOCS B008K3OOJM 3 1346025600 30 its hard to get to the next leavel and get money I did not get the game very much If I had to say how meny stars would be 3
A13HCXFRJ1WOCS B005KCQZ2K 5 1348099200 34 this is an awesome game those people don't now what they are talking about DON'T LISTEN!!!  this game fin and just like a salon and the best part its FREE!!!!! :) get the game!
A13HEBFQAFKG8 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1399852800 341 A few years back, I was sitting at work and was playing some tower defense type games online. Then my coworker brought me to a site where you played &#34;escape the room&#34; type games.if you're not familiar with &#34;escape the room&#34; games, it's quite simple.  The formula isnt as much different than progressing through any other goal oriented games.  You start somewhere, you finish tasks, and you finish the the game.But for the &#34;escape&#34; genre, you start off in a room, you find an item, that leads you to another area of the room, where you may use that item to get another item.  Rinse and repeat, until you find the item that leads you out of the room.(e.g. Start in a living room, find a note on the floor, which has combination written on it.  You find the safe behind the painting.  You use the numbers to get into the safe, you find a key, you use the key to get into the garage.  You find a pipe on the floor, pipe fits to a lever, the lever unlocks the chest, the chest gives you another key, the key gets you into the car, the car is your escape)Now take that simplicity and make it more complicated with a story line that pulls you in.  The Room is the ULTIMATE in this genre.  The story is more of a Gothic/horror style.  Consider the story like an origami toy that someone gave you, and that someone told you that the toy was actually a folded up photo of something interesting and yet horrific.  This game feels like unfolding that origami toy one fold at a time, slowly, and with determination, but also with some unnerving feeling with each move.It's WELL worth the 0.99 cents now.  Do yourself a favor, and buy the game, and take your time beating it.Hint:  If it ever gets too frustrating, put it down.  Play it again the next day.  The extra time will let you see the level with a whole new set of eyes.  :-)
A13HEBFQAFKG8 B00IEBE7GK 5 1399852800 124 I wrote a review of their first game in the series &#34;The Room&#34;  and with this review, I'll try to focus on the changes they've made since the first game.The Room 2, has changed much from it's predecessor.  As the company has honed it's skills, the game has benefited from that.  The changes are many, but subtle.  They add to the experience some extra graphical style, but without sacrificing the depth of the game.The game offered me a couple hours of memorable gameplay.  A couple hours is worth the 3 dollars, when you consider paying 60 dollars for some games on consoles that give you 10-14 hours of gameplay.  3 dollars is WELL worth it.I look forward to fireproofs other games in this genre.
A13HEBFQAFKG8 B00GT67UUM 5 1400630400 58 If you like puzzles, it's worth it.If you like good graphics, it's worth it.If you own a Kindle Fire HDX, it's worth it.The puzzle difficulty increases at a good rate, and it's nice to sit back and enjoy all the detail and effort this team has put into it.*Note, I DID get it when it was 99 cents.
A13HGIWIF7TLMU B00B63HT8Q 5 1389139200 69 Living in Oklahoma where the tornados roam, this application helpsthe user to see where the really severe storms are going.  And Ican now consult the radar before going on a road trip.There are other websites that do the same thing or more but thisone is very responsive, without having to go through many menuchoices.  After you zoom into your area from then on it is 1 click and done.
A13HGIWIF7TLMU B00GWJQVVA 1 1398470400 21 Draw a square and you have completed the course.  But the rest of the content is priced at $1.99 per tutorial.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00881VLCE 5 1400803200 79 Such a great way to do puzzles.  I can't tell you how much fun this is now.  I never lose any pieces.  I can turn it off and come back later it is right at the spot where I left off.  The puzzles can be easy or difficult depending on your choices.  and the pictures are great. You can start on the free version and then upgrade.  On the upgraded version you can use a picture from your camera.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00E3BK0QQ 4 1393372800 31 I've just started this game but so far it is an interesting story with do able tasks and interesting puzzles. It also has a hint that helps keep me on track.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00F8L2VO4 5 1389657600 21 THis app gives me practice time in translation, speaking, and learning new words.  It is interactive. I like it  a lot.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00GP0G0IK 4 1389312000 20 The puzzles were fun but not impossible to work. The story was a simple mystery.  Just search and find fun.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B008Y2FRFO 4 1398643200 58 this is a time mover.  I enjoy the game it doesn't take a lot of brain power.  There is more to it than just pushing coins and I have just opened the puzzles.  I do think it isn't easy to keep the prizes that are dropped but it takes some skill to manipulate the coins as they drop.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00IEBE7GK 5 1398643200 53 I am having a great time playing The Room Two. There are surprises around every corner.  Although I did not turn off the hints I am able to play many of the scenes before the hints are needed. I also like the scenery because there is more to look at in this version.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00AKOB7CG 5 1391385600 21 Just the thing to target parts of the muscular structure that need work.  The timed workouts with directions are very worthwhile
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B0062RM1VQ 3 1391558400 55 I chose this rating because it required me to be on the internet connection constantly to do much of the reading.  I download a lot of books on my kindle and then spend time reading.  I was not sure how to do the downloads as a quick thing.  I guess I might be Amazon dependent.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00E8KLWB4 4 1390348800 23 The puzzles are doable. The story is less active then the games. The game keeps you busy with things to find and collect.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00IEQDOLO 5 1398643200 39 I like hidden object games.  I like the art and graphics in this game.  It is better than some of the games I have played so far. The scenery is interesting.  Sometimes scenery in these games can be boring.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B00AEC8UVU 5 1396224000 23 I can go back to this game over and over.  It is interesting and holds my attention. I like the different story parts.
A13HL1UVBCXQJY B0063222V4 5 1400284800 47 This app is easy to take along.  I can access the information from my kindle fire.  So I can look up the insects or arachnids on the trail as I walk.  Contains the biological names, sting or bite info and pictures. Also has range information and more.
A13HLXM7OGAALE B008Y7SMQU 5 1348358400 37 This is a very fun game to test your knowledge of logos. I have my boys and their friend's help me with some of ones I don't know. We all have a blast seeing who knows more.
A13HLXM7OGAALE B007DKC922 5 1332720000 24 I have had no problems with ap. no force closes very addictive. works great on kindle fire. the higher levels make it more challenging.
A13HLXM7OGAALE B00BS3UFCQ 5 1366243200 23 this game really makes you think. some of the answers are easy and others you really have to put on your thinking cap.
A13HLXM7OGAALE B006VW94HQ 5 1342828800 23 this game works great and it makes you use your mind. Some are easy but others you have to think just a bit.
A13HLXM7OGAALE B007XF3WFA 5 1342828800 23 This game seems really simple but as you go to next levels it really makes you use your brain to match the pairs.
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B0097HSS4M 4 1371945600 47 I like it for being able to crop pictures and other things.  Not a bad little tool.  I know this is impossible, but I wish it could make some of the blur go away in some of my better pictures.  I know that's too much to ask!
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B00CWY76CC 2 1371945600 38 I have tried this game several times now and cannot, for the life of me, figure out how to get to another floor.  I have completed the horse puzzle and to know avail!!!!I believe I have given up.
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B00D4EBQ3E 4 1382918400 21 I have the hardest time getting this word associations to click!  In the end though, I seem to manage to conquer.
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B0069EAMUY 4 1371945600 20 Sometimes I have trouble &#34;unjumbling&#34;, but it is great for the mind.  Eventually, I will get it!  Great pass time.
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B00BJSJKJ4 3 1371945600 23 I like it, but I don't love it!  Easy to play, but not the greatest word game going, unless I have missed something.
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B008IXP8IU 5 1371945600 32 This game drives me crazy, but I cannot put it down.  I will play it until I have finished it.  I don't let it get the best of me and give up!
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B0091REZMW 3 1373587200 54 I am not sure about this because I am not sure how this whole thing works.  I find the items and then what?  If I find some of the items in the allotted time, it then tells me that I found no items!!  I think I need clearer instructions as to how to play!
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B00JV858HM 3 1402876800 43 It is a good pass time and does get you to think.  Not sure I like the part where I have to buy more.  Why not just charge me in the first place instead of nickel diming me to death.  Good game though.
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B006RXD2I6 4 1371945600 44 Like it for all of the various ways the game can be played.  Some are harder than others to learn, but eventually, it will happen.  Like the &#34;demos&#34; to give an idea of how the games are played.  Wish other games did the same!
A13HY4RSJI1EI1 B007SYDYLS 4 1382918400 25 Some words work and some words don't, but it is a good game.  Sometimes how you think words are associated are not as they seem!!
A13I1NA6URX557 B0063IH60K 5 1370908800 25 The app is called Solitaire and that is exactly what you get. That is all I ask for in an app and this one delivers.
A13I1NA6URX557 B00FAPF5U0 5 1390694400 40 Every one talked so much about this game, I avoided it out of spite. But once I finally gave in it is a wonderful little time-waster. Haven't had any problems with freezing or unwanted permissions so 5 stars it is.
A13I1NA6URX557 B00CJ8P82Q 5 1370131200 50 I picked this up hoping for a decent Zuma dupe and got exactly that. The only (very) small problem I've had so far is accidentally pulling up my Kindle menu while trying to shoot but it is really no big deal. Anyway, great time waster and you can't beat free.
A13I5FTEAUK7K8 B008AVPMLI 5 1345593600 23 this app is cool fun and great time waster thank u gamevil and make better weapons I just started playing and ILOVE IT
A13I5FTEAUK7K8 B004SCEUXE 5 1325462400 23 who made this game?but its awesome really. everybody likes star wars who doesn't like star wars just who like a lot of poeple?

A13I5FTEAUK7K8 B008K8U13K 5 1342828800 20 GREAT GAME GOOD GRAPHICS (but annoying controles) BUT AMAZING!!!MUST BUY NOT A RIP-OFF.  SEGA RULES THE WORLD also chuck Norris.
A13I729IPODO2H B00681Z1JA 5 1354579200 24 This version of Solitaire is even better than the one I have on my laptop (I am using this one on my Kindle Fire.)
A13I729IPODO2H B00AFCEIB0 5 1385683200 39 I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire. After all, how does one survive with being able to &#34;google it?&#34; It's easy to desginate the kind of file you want to obtain like Web or Images plus many other types.
A13IB3TGQ5EXAT B00CHNKJFO 5 1379808000 29 The best pin ball game for the Kindle Fire.  Would recommend to download this game.  Very fun and entertaining, and excellent graphics.  GREAT game for any Star Wars fan.
A13IB3TGQ5EXAT B00CEKIGGO 5 1379808000 52 Fun game never crashes, always doing updates.  It is very entertaining and the graphics are great.  You win daily awards. The music is soft.  I would recommend to download this game since it is free and easy to download.  One of my best games for the Kindle Fire.  I play it everyday.
A13IB3TGQ5EXAT B00EBE8MUG 5 1379808000 24 Very fun game.  Very easy game.  Easy game to download Free game to download would recommend this game.  Love this game and great graphics.
A13IBJJ7ZK1IGD B0080H2TFE 5 1397347200 24 Fun game.  It is fun to have games that you can play with your children and you can do it with this game.  Recommend.
A13IBJJ7ZK1IGD B009HUB40Y 5 1398902400 24 It was a lot of fun and I like to challenge my husband on several games.  It was worth it and I enjoy it.
A13IBJJ7ZK1IGD B007OX09MA 5 1382832000 26 I love it.  It helps to keep me focused on what is important in my life.  It contains all the the things that I believe in.
A13ICP105SR756 B0064X7B4A 1 1334793600 21 can't I pay for an ad free version?  they are incredibly annoying .....please release one on amazon! I have a giftcard
A13ICP105SR756 B007SPQ04A 1 1334707200 20 i can't even play it. it auto force closes every time I try to open it. I want a refund
A13IFATH3WVZF4 B00FAPF5U0 4 1391990400 38 My daughter just downloaded this game on my Kindle and I have only played it a couple of times. So far, what I have played has been fun and I think overall this is a very good game.
A13IFATH3WVZF4 B00F8H0LM2 4 1384560000 36 I am new at this. I just bought the Kindle so I have to learn the kindle and the games. I'm sure when I get the hang of this game I am going to love it.
A13IFATH3WVZF4 B00BFUC8RC 5 1388620800 41 This game is a lot of fun. I have not mastered this yet so therefore, the people get dumped out of the cars more often than they should. Each time I play this I get a little better. Very good game
A13IFATH3WVZF4 B008JGSM6G 4 1381104000 26 Thid is another game that makes me use my head. I like that.I just gor my Kindle so I have not played all that much yet.
A13IHYLH74T7WH B005ZXWMUS 5 1369440000 31 This is a great app to have, always available at your fingertips to watch whatever you like when you want to watch.  So glad I was able to install this app.
A13IHYLH74T7WH B007BSPOG4 5 1372204800 49 This allows me to connect with my child which currently lives in Japan,  we're able to see each other and send messages to each other. Another thing is that we can conference call with other family members during the same call so everyone can talk and see each other.
A13IHYLH74T7WH B004MC8CA2 5 1372204800 26 This is wonderful reading easy to use finding passages and scriptures also you can have the bible read to u if you just want to listen.
A13IIINDDABACO B00CWGWAEE 5 1371340800 52 I enjoyed this game thoroughly and can't wait for two to come out. Definitely intend to get that GAME as well. This was well thought out and put together. Congratulations big fish on a job well done! This is why they are my go to company for fun interesting games to play.
A13IIINDDABACO B00BJA2VFW 4 1367107200 24 I ENJOY THE GAME, BUT I WISH IT HAD MORE OF A STORYLINE TO THE GAME. ESSENTIALLY, ITS JUST A FUN PICK 3 GAME.
A13IIINDDABACO B00J206J5E 5 1397433600 21 ITS a fun engrossing game so far. Well worth the price in my opinion. Haven't finished the game yet but enjoying.
A13IIINDDABACO B00ATSBIIG 4 1363996800 55 A slow relaxing game except during challenge mode when you have two minutes to complete the puzzles in and it progresses from super boring easy in glass to a little more difficult in the stone which is as far as I've made. I like this puzzle game and would recommend for those who enjoy puzzles.
A13IIP6HTFNCVT B004SOR4H6 5 1365638400 25 easy to access. Excellent App. Easy to use and access is rapid. Links are supported with no problem. One of the best apps to date.
A13IP3XXEUWOK3 B004UBUK4Q 4 1311897600 27 This is the best tower defense game out.  Then why only 1 star?  No exit,  and app doesn&apos;t close.  Fox this and I award the final star.
A13IP7I4QM74IA B0089Z3D02 5 1356652800 39 I too have been a Pogo member for many yearsand was thrilled to see I would be able tohave it on my Kindle Fire I got for Christmas.problem is I can' find it anyone else had thisproblem? Any suggestions?
A13IP7I4QM74IA B008Y7SMQU 4 1356652800 19 Really makes me have to think!Fun for free&hellip;some are hard others very easyBut really handy for &quot;the waiting area&quot;
A13IP7I4QM74IA B007ZGO7EM 5 1375228800 38 I love this calculator, it's so easy to use, the display is nice and big, I especially like that it shows all of the prior entries so you are sure your addition (subtraction, multiplication, or division) is correct.
A13IP7I4QM74IA B006VW94HQ 5 1372204800 35 Thought I needed to "brush-up" on my language skills, positive it would be a breeze. Well I was surprised to find just how rusty my English degree had become, I really am enjoying this challenge.
A13IP7I4QM74IA B00CKW6FVE 5 1369612800 22 Been Tetris fan for years. This version rocks !!! Can play for a minute or an hour it's a blast !! Thanks...
A13IPV94MW0UX B006OCM0G0 3 1330992000 26 game worked fine for about 1 day then it glitched up and made the screen all green but it was a fun game while it lasted
A13IPV94MW0UX B006OC2ANS 5 1330387200 22 great game love the gameplay great graphics and all wonderful since its gladiators its more fun a little bit like infinity blades
A13IPV94MW0UX B006ON41FC 5 1329436800 45 all you people who gave it a bad rating are idiots you do relise that there is a way to turn off open feint and you should rate the game for the game not that the developers put something in it that you don't like
A13IPV94MW0UX B0066T8M1I 5 1326153600 27 love this game played it like seven different times and each game takes about an hour and the graphics are excellent also the sour effects are great
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B0079Q963K 5 1362009600 39 App works great on my kindle fire. Love to use it at night when my husband is sleeping and I want to watch a TV show. Put on my headphones and I go into my own world. Great !!
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00IEQDOLO 2 1398816000 22 Very simple games, no story line and no real graphics. Not what I expected at all. Probably good as a time waster.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B006WQ9NJU 5 1361491200 26 Love it. The best app I have ever used for storing recipes easily. Told my daughter about it but it is not available for the Ipad.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00J3AW23G 4 1399507200 20 I downloaded this because I like to solve puzzles. This game has levels and becomes more challenges, makes you think.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B009C7ZQM4 5 1367107200 58 Downloaded this app after trying other cleaners for my Kindle Fire which were weak at best. This app is great. Works well and even Albert's you when your storage is getting low so you can avoid being disappointed when trying to download an app or a book and then finding you don't have the space. Highly recommend it.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00D74E5MA 4 1392595200 22 Nice app to browse through designs and color combinations. Some good ideas. Many different rooms and styles. Like a big designers book.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00F0VLN2S 4 1383436800 27 Love Big Fish Games especially for free. This one did not disappoint. Looks like a game for kids but definately not. Thinking about purchasing the full game.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00II5YUIW 5 1400198400 21 Another hit with this game. Great graphics and storytelling. Can't wait for the full game to be available. Definitely buying it.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B009G9KFQ0 5 1362528000 41 Great app. Always updated weather available with extended forecasts. Even gives you air quality and pollen alerts. Check it everyday so I know what to expect since I travel frequently. Best of all it is free. Who could ask for more?
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B008XG1X18 5 1346457600 25 Love all the wonderful ideas and sharing my ideas with others. Wealth of information all in one site. Try it you too will love it.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00C7TAF3Y 4 1404432000 83 Absolutely loved this game. Very interesting and really makes you think about how to get to the next area. I would say I am about 3/4 the way through but am really stuck and the clues are very vague. Put it down for a few days and will definately go back and maybe with a fresh look will be able to complete. Almost downloaded the &#34;cheat&#34; book but hoping I can do it without that. Great challenging game that gives great brain excercise.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00HTKA4N2 2 1392595200 24 No real challenge here. Very simple easy. Not up to par for a real gamer. I am not a fan of these simple games.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B007AL48UK 2 1378252800 21 Nothing different or exciting. Same old same old. Ok for free. Already deleted it .Don't bother with it. Not a fan.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00JJNT3MK 4 1404432000 10 Addicted to hidden object games. This one did not disappoint.
A13IV0A6P6VY0B B00A6F6DIW 3 1397433600 24 Like puzzles but after 10 minutes found this one boring. So boring that I deleted it since I have no intention of playing again.
A13IWAX970W5N8 B0092S4WLY 5 1369526400 21 its great love it best ever not for little kids thougheach floor is like a riddle if you like brain twisters
A13IWAX970W5N8 B00AB7HESI 5 1370908800 26 super cool any one who says anything bad bout it is a liar its super awesome it keeps all ages intertwined for hours on the clock
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B009KS4XRO 5 1381795200 23 Love it, fun game.  I really enjoy this game and play it often, probably more than I should.  LOL.  It is very addictive.
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B0063GORYU 5 1362268800 26 I really like this solitare game called Spider.  It is different than any of the others and you really have to concentrate to win.  Very addictive.
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B004K4RY9M 4 1358208000 29 Very fun game, only one thing wrong with it.  Sometimes you cannot get the line to stick on the word.  Otherwise I would recommend it as I love it.
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B0063IH60K 5 1356825600 25 Love the set up of this game.  Try it, you'll like it.  Makes playing solitare simple and enjoyable, you will play it over and over.
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B00BGBOK9O 5 1371081600 60 This is a very fun 4 pic game.  Makes you really think to get the correct answer.  I also like the Hint feature.  Makes it much more enjoyable.  After wracking your brain, you can get a hint to help.  I can usually figure them out after much thought but there has been a few times that the hint was great.
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B0094BB4TW 5 1371081600 29 I enjoy having facebook on my Kindle Fire HD and is very nice when I am traveling or away from home.  As I can stay in touch, no problem.
A13IYZX3PFLJNY B0063M22QO 5 1363564800 28 I would recommend this game.  Very addictive and fun.  I have only had it for about a week but really enjoy it and I think others would too.
A13IZBGB5S4133 B008IXP8IU 5 1402358400 25 Some puzzles are easier than others.  I enjoy the ones that are more challenging - I think this game can help improve flexible thinking skills.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B0091REZMW 4 1381622400 33 I really like the hidden object games.....this one is spooky just in time for Halloween. There are many ways to play. Word scramble, shadow,hang-man regular pictures or by words. Music is pretty good.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B00IG2DOKM 4 1398470400 28 Township is a fun and casual game. Play when you want. Easy to grow your town and crops. Feed animals build buildings, harvest produce  and mine for gold.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B00DUZKE4O 5 1374969600 31 Easy to see pictures of the movie stars. Scenery and backgrounds good  and clear. Fun to play with others. Glad the app was free, I would of paid fir at too.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B009C7ZQM4 5 1388102400 40 Tried other cleaners and came back to Clean Master. It cleans out unwanted apps or less used ones. Boosts memory, junk files... Clean Master will tell you when it's time to clean up.  You are in charge of the settings.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B00AHNC0SK 4 1389657600 22 For for all ages. Great way to spend time while waiting for the doctor or pharmacist.Fun way to interact with the rides.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B00CWY76CC 4 1371513600 25 A GREAT way to pass the time while riding in a car. I usually play hidden object games, this is a nice change of pace.
A13IZFOYKHD7WN B00E8KLWB4 5 1388793600 33 Good way to spend time when you are waiting for an appointment. Doctor's office, bank lobby, in your car (not driving) waiting for children after school and all of their appointments and schedules.

A13J82FVR83UHB B00AE3J7PM 5 1394323200 30 This is a really good game to all those who love sci-fi and action and multiplaying. I would give this game 100 stars if I could!My game name is: AzurnDaric1
A13J82FVR83UHB B00FRQ32N4 5 1393977600 38 This game is the best one there is! Well, it's the only one there is. You get the idea. This game is so awesome, the only way to know how awesome it is is if you play it!
A13J82FVR83UHB B00B2V66VS 5 1365897600 37 Temple Run 2 is the best game ever! It is even better than Temple Run! Wait? Why are you just reading this review when you can play this awesome game for yourself? Everyone, play Temple Run 2!
A13J835P4INCVT B006QCMPWM 5 1328054400 53 It does exactly what we hoped for and what it says it does. It is a fun and relaxing game where you visit one or two times a day and take care of the fish. Nothing more or less but my kids and I enjoy buying/selling and caring of the fish and tank.
A13J835P4INCVT B007581DPQ 5 1329436800 28 I just downloaded this and within seconds my kids took over my Kindle Fire. We love this app and say get it if you don't already have it!!!
A13J835P4INCVT B008XG1X18 3 1349568000 31 I have been using the app for Pininterest for about 2 weeks. At the beginning the app worked great but the last two or three days it has been force closing.
A13J835P4INCVT B0071PARPA 4 1333324800 22 Was not sure I would like this app but it is great. The shading tool on a thin brush is very cool.
A13J835P4INCVT B0063IH60K 5 1325548800 23 Downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire and it works great. I enjoy playing this game. I like the different options on deals.
A13J835P4INCVT B004MC8CA2 5 1330732800 43 I love this Bible app. It is very easy to search information and it is brat that you can choose which translation to read. It makes it nice to read the same scripture in different translations. Love having the Bible of my phone.
A13J9JT4H56OHM B00FAPF5U0 5 1386201600 23 Get this get this ........plz get this game it's the best game ever in dc you start you can't stop get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A13J9JT4H56OHM B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392076800 23 I love this APP it is soooooo totally fun and super awesome it is almost just like flappy bird and that is awesomeness!!!!!!:):):):)
A13J9JT4H56OHM B00CZDSK7K 5 1381968000 200 I love this game it is the BEST it's soooo fun I never thought this game would be so fun I already have 16generations in the hours the one thing I would change is the prices of the reconstruction in the house and I don't like that how you can only have 6 kids . But other than that I love the game , I have hooked all of my friends on the game because it's so addicting even boys in my high school it's the best sooooo fun and loads super fast and I'm always ready to play the game I just hate when the adults get sick because when the are sick you can't have kids even if one of the adults is sick . But when you do have a kid it's soooo fun I once in my 3rd generation I had triplets they all wanted kids OW yeah if you get some body who defiantly wants kids and some body who says Mabey you end up having kids so MUCH faster it's the best game-LIKE I SAID AND DON'T EVER FORGET THIS VIRTUAL FAMILIES IS THE BEST GAME EVER ,EVER ,  p.s get the game :)
A13J9JT4H56OHM B009UX2YAC 5 1388102400 107 It's OK I have the ronge one more kid and um increase reductio and he was a new puppy it's not written about this morning I will try it out and he was lying to get a huge idiot who was a bad day u going through my dad is going in to be home mommy and he said not be ok so that the party at a time on he was going through a new necklace and he is a mystery to me and my mom said I was in the room and I am going on the phone right hahahahahahaha hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahha hahahahahahahahaaha hahaha hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahha hahahahahahahahaaha
A13J9JT4H56OHM B00H0BGCJK 5 1397174400 39 Ok so kik  two weeks ago I tried to get this and it was 2.99 so like I was upset and finally I look over and it was FREE I was so excited I was all lol  ahhhhhhhh finally
A13JA9872XS7VX B00CRLSN4U 3 1384819200 32 Just want you to &#34;buy&#34; points for hints, letters.  No way to skip picture and go to the next one.  I won't buy points. Defeats the purpose of buying the game. Fustrating.
A13JA9872XS7VX B004JJXVYK 3 1384819200 25 Kind of boring. Easy to solve, don't have to buy anything, but still kind of boring.  At least you can move on without buying points!
A13JCNEVKZWBNA B00ED4TX2A 5 1395273600 22 This is a very fun game with episodes and things to unlock...+u get to kill zombies i mean how awesomeness is tht?
A13JCNEVKZWBNA B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392422400 22 This game is pretty much just like flappy bird.....so if you liked floppy bird you'll like this but it is,a little frustrating.
A13JHR27MLO6LK B007JPG04E 4 1359504000 32 Great game. Great features and controls. I will recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good shooter. I spent 2 hours the first time I played. Good tutorial and help section.
A13JHR27MLO6LK B0090P98Z4 5 1360800000 36 I am usually not a fight game fan...but, in this case...HELL YEAH!!!  The action is good the controls are easy for an old guy like me. U would recommend this game to anyone looking for fun.
A13JHR27MLO6LK B00GTCECVG 5 1392163200 39 Awesome game and gameplay! It is so easy to work your levels up! The controls are easy to learn and there are many opportunities to continue playing even after everything Is at max production. Get the game! Fight battles!!
A13JHR27MLO6LK B0091REZMW 5 1359849600 27 From the start, I was finding my self amused by this app. The gameplay is smoothand flowing. The quests are easy to follow and keeps your attention.
A13JHR27MLO6LK B00DHQHQCE 5 1377302400 26 The game is a combination of a city building, tower defense and a rpg. If you enjoy these types of games, hi will enjoy this one.
A13JHR27MLO6LK B00CH87HF4 5 1367539200 43 As all to the titles from Gameloft, I found Dungeon Hunter 4 to be well thought out. The control layout is great, the enemies are good and the.backgrounds work. The only thing I might change or add would be alternative source of gems.
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B0076POKVC 1 1340841600 28 this game is so stupid. it tells you to do stuff you don't even know how to do. if you get mad easily,  DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B004Z9Y3VY 3 1327190400 31 well, first of all, this game is fun. not OH MY GOSH THIS IS SO FUN!! type of fun, but not boring either. if you like good games, get this game.
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B004QJKRZ4 1 1326672000 31 bank robber is ok,but kinda BORING!!!!! goodbye bank robber. don't waste you're time on this game.it is really really really really really really really REALLY REALLY REALLY BOOOOOOOORING........I'm deleting this game.
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B0054JZC6E 5 1348185600 20 this game is awesome I love it defy gcf Rfd Cfc frf dre fed dds dddcrdd dds reed fdxddcc rxc
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B0086700CM 5 1340841600 21 This game is my favorite game ever. Works great on the kindle fire!!!!!!!! If you love challenging games, get Temple Run.
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B008N8IV2U 1 1354320000 21 I hate this stupid freaking game! I just want to delete it and never see it again!!!!! ugh!!!!! bdfvdvdhd xhxhdhd fhdhhdhf
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B008V06NRU 5 1372550400 21 I absolutely ADORE this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the little pou guy is so cute.  GET THIS GAME NOW OR YOU WILL BE SAD!!!!!
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B009UX2YAC 4 1356480000 22 I like this game. to me its kinda a downgraded version of temple run. also does anyone love Beatrice Miller? I do!!!!!!!
A13JJX7N4ISVZ B00CZDSK7K 5 1379721600 88 Omg okay so like I was trying to get my people(their names are/were soonella and bohi) to have a kid and it kept saying&quot; soonella sees bohi&quot; and the other way around too and then all of a sudden it says &quot;Bohi sees Bohi&quot; and so I figured out it changed soonellas name to bohi and that's even what it said on the family tree. lol I'm still laughing about it but otherwise I adore this game I have played it nonstop for like 2 days get it!!!
A13JL0JVTZ2RSG B00FAPF5U0 5 1395964800 20 It's a fun game that everyone can play. The kids love it an so does my husband and I. Thanks.
A13JL0JVTZ2RSG B00IS87HYI 3 1403568000 22 It's just okay. Mainly got it for my grandkids to play when they are visiting. Good thing is that it was free.
A13JL0JVTZ2RSG B00FEIX5OG 5 1405641600 7 Addictive game. I really enjoy playing it.
A13JL0JVTZ2RSG B00A3NQNUU 3 1376611200 20 It's okay, I suppose. The grandkids liked it ! Will keep it around for them when they come visit again.
A13JL0JVTZ2RSG B006IXO1G2 4 1333411200 29 Just got the ancestry.com app and I love it. I was hoping I'd be able to access my tree on my kindle and now I can! !! Thanks Amazon.
A13JL0JVTZ2RSG B009UX2YAC 4 1376611200 26 They loved it. Will keep it around for them when they next come to visit. It keeps them occupied when they can't go outside to play.
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B00AA87JGU 5 1383436800 39 The game is super duper  fun but I really do think the keys in gold should be free.  over all it is a really fun, yet challenging game. oh and some levels I would advise you to use paper.
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B007P8BMTS 5 1370304000 33 I love this app because I get to see episodes that I missed or that I had never saw. I think that you did a awesome job pf making this app. Thank you.
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B00BS3UFCQ 5 1366329600 21 I love it .it is great .I think it is the best game I have ever had before in my life.
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B00ESNW58K 5 1379721600 32 I love this game! it is super awesome especially the cute animals.  although I do wish that it did not take so long to build.  but so far I am loving it!
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B00DJFIMW6 5 1373932800 27 This game is so much fun to play. I like to play with my friend and family and my little sister love to play this game also.
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B00ABGEFWC 5 1404172800 20 I love this game. It is so much fun. Even.my litttlensister loves this games she plays it all the time.
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B0063IH60K 5 1368316800 20 I love this game. it is the best. sometimes. I do not even use the one button. I love it
A13JOVVUYF56B5 B00B2V66VS 5 1361318400 94 This is the best game ever because I love it when you control the person you are playing as you choose and that you can pay thing that you want to get but you need to have the money first and so I love this and I thank you for making Temple Run 2, Temple Run 1 and Temple Run Brave thank you so much I like the person who came up with this game like I said in the beginning of my opinion I love this game so much.Love Alexandria Nicole Galbreath Osterman
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B00HY9UK28 5 1394928000 46 This is a great combination of old and new songs together! I could already tell that this quiz is an easy A for music lovers. I recommend this game for people who just wants a fun challenge. Now I want a fun challenge, got to go!
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B0085N9I84 5 1339632000 20 luv it for real best game ever! gonna play it every day so omg brb lol again luv it! hay!
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B00846GKTW 5 1339632000 24 it is fab luvit 4ever gonna play it all day long so play it love it then rate it 5 and that's a fact!
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B00DJK2TO8 5 1377302400 36 This is an awesome free app for the boredness to go away! one problem: when you are stuck in a level, u are stuck in tht level! Lucky for me, I am a fan of music!
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B0086700CM 5 1340582400 58 I think this game is fun but some pple are hating it. well if u hats this game u should get a life u piece of junk,  crap,  and sorrow . so u try and see if its good or not cuz its good. again if u are the haters of this game u are big fat losers.
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B008B84O6Y 5 1340755200 50 hey peeps its me Jodasha!  I think u should play this game cuz its fun ;-)! anyways if u hear (or see duh) those bad comments about this prized winner game then don't listen to them. Okay? ok. remember that this game is off the hook. Bye! - Jodasha ;-()
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B00IIY2DP0 4 1401062400 66 I thought that this game is excellent! This teaches me that books can come to life! I like how they make a chapter in each section to create the suspension. The only thing I dont like is how long we have to wait. I dont think its fair to the people that can't spend money. If the waiting thing stops, then I'll give it a 5.0.
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B00CEBO09A 5 1371254400 44 This game is awesome. It's a very addicted game. You get to jump away and on the dogs. So it's a really great game for my little brothers. This is my opinion but I really think you should play this game for all ages!
A13JQDRVPVL0MP B00766HXAQ 5 1341532800 37 I rate this two thumbs up, three winning strikes and five stars I luv this game and u can play with a partner and challenge him/her and see who wins! trust me, its a MUST HAVE game.
A13JUQEA86P2SA B00E7VV2RS 4 1382745600 22 graphics are good. keeps me busy. unfortunately, it is because of the graphics that my battery is drained in half the time.
A13JUQEA86P2SA B007TBAQCK 5 1335657600 22 awesome game.. played on facebook but the app is even better.. no glitches or issues.. addicted more now than i was before!!!!!
A13JUQEA86P2SA B008183CTE 5 1337904000 25 this game looked really silly to me at first, but i cant stop playing.. i'm addicted! kill my battery daily cause i cant stop playing!!!
A13JV55NDS5664 B00BR5759Q 4 1370217600 26 It's very addicting when you start playing. The only thing that sucks is you can't play unlimited you have to wait for your time to rejuvenate.
A13JV55NDS5664 B00BJCM3S0 5 1370217600 24 I have a 5yr old who loves this game. She will play on my kindle when we go places especially at the doctor's office
A13JV55NDS5664 B005ZFOOE8 5 1384041600 20 Best music app I have used. The custom channels are great and there's a mix of new and old music.
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B005V1N71W 1 1376611200 53 I really don't get this app. While trying to listen to music, different songs would start playing and I couldn't shut it off. Very dangerous, if you have kids don't let them use this app, as you don't know what song will turn on. I immediately deleted this app minutes after buying it.
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B006OBWGHO 3 1376611200 34 This game is fun, undoubtedly. The only thing is: since this is the free version, there are only a couple of levels and then you have to pay $2 to play the real game!
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B00DY1VOV6 2 1383091200 63 As a mother, I want to encourage my girls about being dressed appropriately. As this app is fun, most of the clothes are very showy and Seaside Salon also has things like bikinis (and some that focus on features it shouldn't be focusing on). You may want to think twice about getting this app and making sure you keep your morals in check!
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B007XKEY6Q 5 1383091200 32 I love Draw Something! This game is so much fun to be able to interact with your friends and send drawings back and forth with each other! On my list, a must-get!
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B00F1RR3Y8 1 1381881600 68 You shouldn't get this app. Since it's free, there are only like two colors and they're yellow and green! There's nothing fun to do and you have to paint EVERY SINGLE FINGER where as in other nail games you just press a button and your design goes on every finger! There are also constant adds popping up when you're trying to play the game! Don't get this app.
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B00DJFIMW6 5 1378080000 66 I love this app! I had Temple Run 2 first and thought that nothing could get better than that. I was totally wrong! Minion Rush hits all the stops with cool graphics and by just being an easy to navigate game. Fun for kids, this isn't educational, but definitely a good game to have when you just want to play. Perfect for Despicable Me fans! :)
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B00FAPF5U0 4 1383091200 28 Candy Crush is very fun and very addicting! The only thing I would say is I can't get past level 8 but I guess that's my problem! :)
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B0064X7B4A 5 1389830400 54 I think this is a really fun game! I play it all the time! It tests your brain in the part of the app that is a game (pretty much Scrabble) and you can communicate with your friends and family with the chat part! I highly recommend you get this app, plus it's free!
A13JW9YIZVM79Z B005X9498M 1 1376611200 38 This app does what it says, pretends to be an iPhone 4S, but that's it. To further explain myself: It looks like an iPhone screen but you can't do anything with this app. I don't recommend it. :(
A13JZQXU6HK73Y B00A8ECU24 1 1370736000 24 I like the game but the mini-games won't work! Why is that? It's like, when I do something with my finger it won't respond!
A13JZQXU6HK73Y B00AH3B7X4 5 1359244800 20 I'm just downloading this game and I already have a review ready. So just to tell you I LOVE FASHION!
A13JZQXU6HK73Y B009HKL4B8 4 1375142400 44 This game is so awesome but I deleted it two times because I couldn't send my sims to work so yea again this game is awesome with all the cool graphics and reactions and on so everyone should buy this app it is awesome
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B004RDFDEO 4 1362441600 35 I doubt if you can find another checkers game that is better. This one has good graphics. It's fast and smooth and it plays a great game. In fact, it's a real challenge to beat.
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B00A3DZ61W 5 1362441600 63 This is my favorite Angry Birds, so far. I went as far as I could, then started over so that I could get three stars on every level. Then I had to get another phone, lost everything and I refuse to do it all again. I was so close to unlocking more levels! Aaagh. Why can't they make backup and restore work right?!
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B009EEFTMC 5 1362441600 30 I am constantly trying to beat my best score. It's one of those puzzles that eat up your spare time and then some. I keep saying to myself, &#34;Faster! Faster!&#34;
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B00B99KJR0 4 1367280000 90 This is one of those games that I had to play every spare minute until I finished it. It's great in that way. However, although some levels are more challenging than others, there's no consistent, gradual increase in difficulty. Instead, it's just hit-or-miss whether or not you're about to play a tougher puzzle.For me, the story is irrelevant. In fact, I skipped over every dialogue. They could have just left out the story and named the game something entirely different. The puzzles are what the game is really all about.
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B005ZXWMUS 4 1362441600 49 If only there were more and better content. They have just enough &#34;good&#34; shows and movies to make it worthwhile. It's truly a great bargain. I just wish more of the better movies were streamed. I'd pay $4 more per month to have streaming access to the DVD movies.
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B004R49A4W 3 1362441600 83 This app has an enormous amount of content. I really like the audio bird calls. However, I do not like the interface. It seems poorly thought out. Even to exit the app you have to click on Menu then scroll to the bottom of a long list to find &#34;Exit.&#34; There are people in the software world who understand interface design; they should hire one. With it's massive content, if the UI were more intuitive and understandable, I'd easily give it five stars.
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B0058EBNAO 2 1362441600 96 At first I thought I liked the unique interface. I thought I'd adjust, but after a month, I found that I still had to think too hard to read the screens.Also, there are two forecast / data providers and their predictions and their current data vary wildly. Sometimes one is correct and sometimes the other. I want just one - one that I can trust, not two that are sometimes, maybe correct. You end up not believing either and constantly switching between the two.I'll just move along and continue my quest for the perfect weather app.
A13K1FTZFDTMW0 B006PKQQSE 5 1347408000 26 Excellent implementation. The only thing missing is a &quot;10 for 2&quot; option (bidding 10 books for 200 points.) I hope the publisher will add this soon.
A13K6Y5OBHQW0V B00FIW5BZE 5 1394668800 51 This is a great app for the puzzler. I have found that I love to go back to levels I have beaten and passed in order to get 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. This makes for challenging gameplay and a great way to learn better logic for this game.
A13K6Y5OBHQW0V B00DVKOYBM 5 1394668800 61 This app is great fun and very safe. There are pre-written sayings like &#34;nice play&#34; that you can send to your opponent if you like to do that, otherwise nothing foul can be said between players. This makes for nice easy playing without any uncomfortableness. As far as gameplay, if anyone has ever played yahoo pool, this is very similar. Enjoy!
A13K6Y5OBHQW0V B00E8KLWB4 5 1400976000 25 There are so many things to do in this hidden game. Great for those who love the hide and seek situations. Probably for ages 10+.
A13KA4QQ5BNL1B B00BHHIWQO 4 1378857600 34 I didn't  think I would like this game but I do. I can't seem to put it down. It makes me want to compete with my friends, to se if I can pass them.
A13KA4QQ5BNL1B B00A4KVFLY 4 1376352000 22 I recommend this game to anyone who likes to compete but you may hate the fact that you have to buy coins.
A13KA4QQ5BNL1B B00B2TET3C 5 1376611200 27 There are some many bingo game but nothing compares to this .It gives you a break and doesn't make you feel like you are playing for nothing.
A13KA4QQ5BNL1B B00EQB80HE 5 1378857600 19 I love bingo games and this one I could get used to.I would recommend  this game to my friends.
A13KA4QQ5BNL1B B009HUB40Y 4 1379116800 32 It very similar to bejeweled n very easy to play but I don't  like the fact that it hounds u to play on fb with. Sometimeswe would like to play amongst ourselves.
A13KEEVJQ0GW0Z B005ZFOOE8 4 1389484800 41 I like this app because it lets me make my own channels and listen to the radio even if it isn't a radio station that is in my area. But it is hard to find the stations that you have created.
A13KEEVJQ0GW0Z B00D1P685C 4 1384560000 23 I like this app because it is easy and gets the job done. I think this is one of the most significant apps.
A13KEEVJQ0GW0Z B006HJKKCG 4 1367539200 25 his app is marvelous ..it helped learn a little Spanish.....se aprende algo nuevo dada dia. And with this app I learner some thing new everyday.
A13KF5GFONOJZR B00BNH1PF8 5 1371772800 26 This game is so cool and fun all you have to do is  look at the four pictures and see what they have in common .
A13KF5GFONOJZR B00I8M64QG 1 1391904000 22 It's so horrible just a rip off and fake and just a rip off of flappybird hi v hi bug saw ed
A13KGH6PH4DS5C B008M2WGRI 5 1358467200 27 It was totally worth a dollar, it is the best one! In my opinion this is the best zombie app ever! I would completely recommend this game!
A13KGH6PH4DS5C B0066T8JRK 1 1378166400 34 So i bought this game for $5 because i wanted to see it, but i can't even do that. I am very disappointed and angry, keep away if you have a kindle fire HD.
A13KGH6PH4DS5C B00785P2QC 4 1359590400 21 If you like all those Facebook games this  ones perfect for you. Ever  day you can add more to your town.
A13KHCB7NGJD5T B0087FMUCQ 4 1386460800 38 I found this game to be challenging.  Takes a bit to get the hang of controls but once u have it you will enjoy it.  The courses are unique.  Wish I could golf in real time this good.
A13KHCB7NGJD5T B00ETADXY2 4 1389225600 28 Tough game but works great.  Wish hint mode would only hint 1 move .I think that if you like ball games and puzzles, you will like this game
A13KHCB7NGJD5T B00K7C17QW 3 1403049600 64 VERY interesting game.  I do not like having to play limited time if I don't pay up. Help police I am being held up at gun point.  I FINALLY except that daily play will be short.  Otherwise great game I recommend it but have another game to go too.  It would be easy to get a group together to see who solves it first.
A13KK6DFK3HV0D B008Y7SMQU 5 1347753600 26 awesome app it was definately worth getting. Developer definately knows what they are doing. also I am just saying this so I can get free guesses
A13KK6DFK3HV0D B0090JC6DQ 5 1349395200 26 this game is awesome I love it.  at first it is hard to steer but practice makes perfect . I would rate this game 5 stars
A13KK6DFK3HV0D B00A04GA14 4 1353196800 30 it is good that this game is free. And it has improved from the first contract killer but they expect you to spend your own money on credits and money
A13KLG880E6S6R B00CTQ6SIG 5 1386633600 133 This game is super fun and funny, just like the TV show. I would recommend that everyone read a bit about the game before you start playing, mainly because there is some &#34;strategy&#34; needed to spending &#34;donuts&#34; within the game. Donuts are a higher form of currency which can only be replaced with actually dollars (meaning that you need to spend money of your own) and they are difficult to earn inside the game itself. I really appreciate that the majority of the game is 100% free (with no ads!) and you can play for years without spending any of your own personal money. But once you've started investing time in the game, you will WANT to spend and buy donuts - so read online about the best recommendations for spending donuts. :)
A13KLG880E6S6R B00A9JG6RS 4 1374019200 66 Super fun game but I've been stuck at level 29 for months. Using upgrades and power-ups haven't helped. I have sunk a lot of time and money on this level and cannot clear it, which is a bummer because I have 3 stars on all the other levels (obviously I'm not just a lousy player). Hopefully the new update will help me get past this one!
A13KLG880E6S6R B00FR84CB8 3 1383609600 712 Based on some of the earlier reviews, I have to say that Disney is listening. The earlier complaints about keys costing money still stand, but the pricing has changed. I was able to purchase all 3 keys for a single 99 cent purchase (previously, the keys were 99 cents each). I hope the next update has removed some/all of the requests to link to Facebook. This game is clearly designed for all-ages, so they shouldn't be promoting a social website that is for 13 years+. Plus, from what I can tell, the only thing you can do with a Facebook connection is bother your friends with your score updates. Who cares? I choose not to link my games to my FB account and I wish there was an on/off switch for this request. Instead, it shows up after EVERY level and on EVERY game page.The game itself is really fun. I love the creative new levels and "swaps" of the characters that they have come up with. Even though there are a lot of levels and goodies, I have worked my way through to the end. I hope they update this frequently! I have even collected as many ducks as I can (you can collect ducks by unlocking achievements, although there is no indication in the game as to what this actually means... in the original WMW the achievements opened bonus levels).UPDATE May 2014:Disney seems to have listened and has taken lot of the Facebook nagging out of the game all together, however some problems still remain. For example, they clearly state that "if you make any in-app purchase, ads will be gone forever!" and since I purchased the gate keys to advance levels, I didn't see ads... until now. The ad will pop up at inappropriate times and then cause the game to crash. I am also having problems updating the game (I can see the new level available, but then I can't access it) so I contacted Customer Service. Their response is that 1) Disney doesn't consider marketing their own items as "ads" so you will, from time to time, see a pop-up for another Disney game or product but that isn't an "advertisement" because it doesn't come from a 3rd party. WHICH IS BALONEY. The CS rep said that the "gone forever" message should have been removed a couple of months ago but possibly there is a glitch in my game that retained the original message, so I should disregard it. WHAT?! I made the purchase and by their own offer, they shouldn't spam me with advertisements. It's really lousy that they're going back on this offer. I should at least be grandfathered in, since I signed up and made purchases when that offer WAS valid. 2) to resolve any glitches, the recommendation is to uninstall and reinstall the game. THE CATCH IS that the data isn't backed up anywhere... except... wait for it... FACEBOOK. So unless you're willing to link to Facebook, you will lose all of your progress, including any purchases that you have made. When I asked for a work-around because I do not have a FB account, the representative told me that I should ask a friend or family member for their password!!! (I have this communication in writing, BTW) Not only is that a violation of ALL security recommendations, it's also just not practical. I shouldn't have to ask someone to share their personal data info with me so that Disney can capture it so that I can backup a game on my tablet! Not to mention that I wasn't asked for my age... what if I were a child? That is the advice that they give? Ask someone to loan their sensitive personal data? Absolutely ridiculous. It's almost offensive, especially since anyone with a basic understanding of computers should be able to transfer app data off their tablet (for backup and retrieval) which is actually very easy with a Kindle. CS should be providing me the steps on how to find the right file and save it on a computer, rather than advising me to borrow someone's account information.I honestly feel that if management at Disney, Amazon, or Facebook knew that this was the official Customer Service recommendation protocol, heads would be rolling.

A13KQ4G8KLWVOI B00FN811SY 5 1386374400 35 This marvellous app needs to be made available for the Kindle Fire HD. So many are waiting for it. It looks like I'll be getting an ipad for my primary device real soon if not!
A13KQVTP6E37D2 B009WO7NQO 5 1355788800 81 I really want this game for my kindle but i refuse! I've already played it, I know its fun, but I think its funny Amazon how it goes from $2.99 now 99&cent;. I feel sorry who ever got this game at first and got ripped off so that is why I'm waiting patiently for the free. I bought bad piggies for 2.99 then here come the next week later its free. Not making that mistake again. Amazon you cant fool me.
A13KQVTP6E37D2 B007P6T52G 3 1367366400 261 I love this game! I had it since August? September? Sometime during 2012 and I loved it! Then OpenFient stopped working and couldn't go to my friends islands. Next thing you know it goes off Amazon. I was so upset and scared that if I ever took it off it would be gone for good! Ugh. Well I kept it, kinda stopped playing because I couldn't do much and now I found out that its back! I tried to update it and then another disappoint ment... It won't let me play! I open it up it loads to 100 and then poof it turns off! I tired and tried and tried again it wont work! So I unistalled it and reinstalled (Very hard for me too do) all my progress, that I worked so hard for, I knew was gone. I tired too open it up again and it still wont load all the way!! Tried over and over and nothing. I am so disappointed and I really hope Pixonic and Amazon can fix this! This was my favorite game to play kn my kindle. I can't even play it at all anymore. I would give it a 5 because it is very fun! I should give it a 1, I mean it DOESN'T work at all! Please fix! A lot of people spent money on it in then past and now since there's an update, people are going to update, and there going to be so disappointed if it doesn't work and they uninstall and reinstall it. Please please fix.
A13KQVTP6E37D2 B004SBQGHS 5 1346284800 103 This is a great game and it says what it means, ad free! People are are stupid to say there are ads well tell me where, because what I see is on the menu its shows the amazing Alex game and couple things that envolve angry birds and on the pause menu it shows the same thing. If it bothers you soo much well pause the game look to the right corner and click the pig and poof .. pause menu &quot;ads&quot; are gone!! OMG its amazing!.. -.- People are so stupid! Ravio you did a great job and I love this game!&lt;3
A13KQVTP6E37D2 B0096DFBZQ 2 1347667200 61 So I saw this game, I played this game and Loved it!! but played some more and relized...relized that it has only one character and one race track unless I buy the full one ... smh of course. Overall it is fun, control is great, graphics are awesome but boring since there's nothing else to it :/ 2 stars I guess.
A13KQVTP6E37D2 B009G1J62C 4 1356652800 75 Alright, I'm annoyed. I bought this game when it came out like forever ago and it was soooo fun, but now since I beat it all, including all the stars, I was excited for the update. Well amazon I have waited like how long? Four months!! Im ready for the update already! Please I know I'm not the only one here. The 4 stars means love love love the app, hate hate hate the wait.
A13KR3DFPMH6PN B00FZEK72M 4 1405987200 22 It is a decent time waster. It starts out very easily and gets harder with time. I like the game so far.
A13KR3DFPMH6PN B00A4KVFLY 5 1400716800 52 I am a HUGE Family Feud fan, and this game does not disappoint!  I only wish there was a way to earn more coins without purchasing them.  One spin a day is just not enough, especially when you will probably only earn enough to play a game or two for the day!
A13KR3DFPMH6PN B00HDRTGDK 4 1389484800 27 It is pretty fun so far.  I am playing at level three and was almost stumped a few times. It is a nice trip down memory lane.
A13KTS902WO1 B00DYY92MG 3 1376179200 44 you need to have a skip this question button ! or a way to get on with the game when you have no coins to buy hints.Cuz otherwise you just dont play the app, and go on to something else, because its stuck there
A13KTS902WO1 B00EBCO798 3 1379462400 31 It makes me want to travel. And naming some of these was harder than I thought. But I do love a challenge. And I saw places I didn't know we're there.
A13KTS902WO1 B00IG63BVK 3 1405296000 25 I began with max bet and in two minutes was up three levels. Wins are good its fun. Graphics cute. Bonus games hard to get.
A13KU2ZUNWSPPN B00A9JG6RS 5 1363996800 22 real challenge to determine the secret to clearing the board, especially as you get to higher levels.  I am enjoying this game
A13KU2ZUNWSPPN B007TO3JW6 4 1363996800 21 Having fun .... as I earn more coins and can open other slots for a variety.  Fun to play and relaxing.
A13KU2ZUNWSPPN B009O2XY12 2 1363996800 24 I can't figure out the secret to playing this and I gave up.  I'm sure it is easy but I became frustrated with it.
A13KU2ZUNWSPPN B004LZIZHU 3 1363996800 33 Not enough information to find out what the &#34;rules&#34; are for playing under difficulty.  Such as time restraints and how high your score has to be to go on to....I don't know what.
A13KWIY8N87KOS B00B99KJR0 4 1363737600 20 This usually isn't my type of game, but the graphics and story are entertaining.  The tutorial really is really helpful.
A13KWIY8N87KOS B008Y2FRFO 5 1363737600 34 The concept of the game is pretty simple.  The beauty is that you don't get the frustration of wasting coins at your local arcade.  I enjoyed this way more that I thought I would.
A13KZW6UGPT8VC B006CTJCWK 4 1396569600 23 Would be helpful if still in college but not needed right now in time.  Overall info in good and easy to use interface
A13KZW6UGPT8VC B00DZYXTRY 3 1394496000 22 Good educational game for all ages when it doesn't freeze.  Hopefully will be updated soon my device is a Next book 8
A13KZW6UGPT8VC B004T2QZL8 4 1396569600 36 Glad to download and works for part on my nextbook.  Will crash on startup on one put of four times first time.  But at fun enough to try a second click before going to uninstall still.
A13KZW6UGPT8VC B00G9B1MEM 3 1396569600 34 The making of the trench gets glitchy at times.  Cuteness would be good for when little man gets older but that ain't for a few years so might not last much longer for now
A13KZW6UGPT8VC B00CBT4F3G 5 1394928000 28 Looks good and runs great on my Nextbook.  Looks to be fun and will be a keeper.  Was thinking of buying this but even happier it was FAOTD.
A13L13LQ5SM615 B00FEMJF6O 3 1386720000 34 Claims there is an update but when you try to update it there isn't one and now I can't play it :( loved this  game till this issue. Hopefully this issue gets fixed asap!
A13L13LQ5SM615 B00GSZEBE2 2 1390780800 22 Loved this until I got over 25 lvls now I can't even get the game to load. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
A13L13LQ5SM615 B00H343YNQ 5 1397088000 24 Lot of fun. Multiple slot machines to choose from. Like that there are even high roller slots and various ways to get free credits.
A13L5WS37GGZQH B0054JZC6E 5 1351555200 32 I like this game.All you have to do is play mini games and work your way up until you  get to finish all the games. I rate it a 5 star game!
A13L5WS37GGZQH B00876UUN6 5 1351296000 32 I think everyone should have this game.When I first got it I thought it would be like pokemon its not. It is the beet game ever!I rate it a 5 star game!
A13L6KDPLGUP4J B0058UZSGS 4 1362182400 25 I have a lot to do and instead of writing it on multiple pieces of paper i can make one portable easy to access list.
A13L6KDPLGUP4J B00A3E2BVE 5 1370995200 20 I love competing against friends and strangers and seeing who knows more artists and songs from which genres and years!!!
A13L6KDPLGUP4J B0094J0J18 5 1349568000 23 I loves this game because it deals with Roman history and it has a great story behind it and it has decent graphics
A13L6KDPLGUP4J B009HKL4B8 5 1376611200 39 Fun to play. Easily keeps you  occupied. Free app that  is actually a lot of fun. Only thing I would like to see is the ability to have more SIMS the game tells me I have reached my limit.
A13L7GHYF4UU9Q B004S2W37O 4 1347840000 106 I love this app. Our 5 person family has been using this for over a year now and it so useful. The lists for each person color coded is awesome! At a glance you can see what activity each family is doing that week. Grocery lists are easily updated and since each family member can update it, we hardly ever have to run to the store to buy something that we forgot we didn't have on hand. The journal feature is great but recently has been giving me an error message when I upload a photo. Fix that and it's back to 5 stars! Motorola Razr.
A13LFY3EG8TKK3 B00BXPQN2K 4 1382486400 94 I am completely addicted to this game. If you have patience you don't have to spend any $. I would like to be able to rotate the position of items 160 to the left or right. I would also like to be able to minimize the quests in the left side of the screen. I feel like they limit my view of the land in that area, and I find that frustrating. I'm tempted to spend $, but not going to if I'm not going to get the results I want when I do.
A13LFY3EG8TKK3 B009LQ8X58 4 1367193600 24 Does exactly what it says it will do, in a short amount of time. Use it on a daily basis. Tablet runs like New
A13LFY3EG8TKK3 B0089DZSNE 1 1373587200 32 Unless you buy the full version this is useless. You can only go so far then u have to buy it. If your looking for a free fun game this isn't it.
A13LFY3EG8TKK3 B00ANGMT0U 3 1382486400 57 If you want to progress quickly you need to spend $. I got this in July and have only made level 14, and barely uncovered any of the island. The more progress you make the more $ it cost to progress.  Ok time killer, could be a drain on your bank account if you're O C D.
A13LFY3EG8TKK3 B007P8BMTS 1 1372723200 23 Pretty much useless u can go to the website and watch more episodes than with this app. Also available on July & Netflix
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00F48TFV8 5 1382659200 32 I love it th is game is very entertaining and I love the little guys that run all over the place...l.o.l.If you want cute and fun this is the game for you.
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00BM7HD4Q 5 1388793600 41 At first this game looks kind of cartoony,but DON'T let that stop you from getting this game...if you love strategy and you love cards you'll LOVE THIS GAME...It also has a great tutorial..try it...it's free..but I don't think you'll be disappointed!!
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00C2VIA52 5 1384041600 33 If someone has not already told you about how great this game is,then let me tell you. There is not a better free card game e out there!I love this game!!!It's way,way cool.
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00AMPALV6 4 1382572800 24 Spend hours and hours playing this game .cool monsters.Really fun game for all.I would suggest for all ages,especially for new tree traiding card people.
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00DHQHQCE 5 1383523200 35 This game so awesome,it's like Troll Wars,but solo much better.I recommend this game for all ages!!!! You have to wait a little while,if you don't want to spend a lot of money,but I love it,cool!!
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00ANHJ8K8 5 1384560000 25 I LIKE TO PLAY A LOT OF STRATEGY GAMES,BUT ITS ALSO NICE TO PLAY FUN AND COOL GAMES.THIS GAME FUN AND VERY ENTERTAINING.!Try it !!!
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00EUCL6R0 5 1382400000 30 This is wonderful. You have to work hard not to spend a lot of money,but worth every battle. I love this game and play every day. Great for new fighters.
A13LJHMMRM3B9Q B00HY5QKHQ 5 1392422400 46 This IS THE BEST FREE GAME IN THE STORE...I have to say at first,I thought..there's little blobs..this games is for children...BUT,the blobs don't last!...the real AVATARS,come quickly..and there AWSOME!,with lots to do and lots of leveling up!  I am on a KINDEL and it works great!!
A13LJLI60DGRNJ B00BX42FLY 5 1397865600 35 This is a fun way to kill time. I find it works best on a tablet. On my phone the pictures are too small to figure out. But on my 8&amp;#34; tablet it works great
A13LJLI60DGRNJ B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384473600 25 My opinion may change after I have played for a while but so far so good. They should provide some hints in the first levels
A13LJLI60DGRNJ B004Z9Y3VY 5 1314144000 34 I an not sure what I expected but this was not what I expected. Very clever  fun and people, it is FREE stop complaining... I got more than my moneys worth so to speak
A13LJLI60DGRNJ B004X80QNG 1 1378425600 61 I agree with a another review, how can they pass this off as a 9.99 app when this is v2 and they have released v3?  Luckily for me it was the free app of the day, but I still uninstalled it immediately. Amazon is partially at fault for offering an out of date app and showing a regular price of 9.99
A13LJLI60DGRNJ B005EI48SI 5 1321660800 22 Great but please translate I would like to know a little more like understand the difference between the two types of &quot;marbles&quot;
A13LKEH8ZU9MF4 B005ZXWMUS 5 1384992000 22 Love Netflix.  I use this quite often both at home and watch it while at the gym on my phone.  Love Netflix.
A13LKEH8ZU9MF4 B0066TUXU6 1 1384992000 21 There's nothing on this that we wanted to watch.  Netflix spanks this company.  they just don't have anything current to watch.
A13LKEH8ZU9MF4 B004SYNIJ4 3 1394928000 30 It worked great at first, but now it's not working on my Kindle.  Haven't had time to figure out what's wrong with it.  If it worked, it would be great.
A13LKEH8ZU9MF4 B0055DL1G4 3 1395100800 25 It's okay.  I don't really use it that much.  the concept of being able to watch the news on the go is a good one.
A13LKEH8ZU9MF4 B006SMEV9K 1 1394928000 20 Could not find a way to &#34;tab&#34; in the application. It was really just too basic for what we wanted.
A13LNUJUEG0RTZ B006OC2ANS 2 1330387200 21 ok app. freezes up on my fire often. don't see what the hype is all about. its just average to me.
A13LNUJUEG0RTZ B00G5LQ5MU 4 1384473600 29 It's an okay game for free. I would recommend that it be given a try. You have to pay for hints, but otherwise it's a pretty good escape game.
A13LQ3QUJCIK13 B00DJFIMW6 5 1402444800 57 This game is great, in this game there are many  secret places that you can ger to.In my experience with this game  i got to unlock many other minions With cool accessories,when it is a rainy or a boring time this game is very entertaining.Collect bananas, unlock minions, and have fun!!- April crimson  i love cats wench!
A13LQ3QUJCIK13 B00AKFBURC 3 1404345600 86 It's not the best but I don't know how I feel about this game it's ok but on the other hand it's not so grate I mean it's not so fun really... my brothers reaction to this game was like wahh?!!! And then he was like what the hell!! And then I was like oh no you did not girlfriend even though he's a boy i don't really care, so uhh yeah yeah any way it's not a grate game so... bye!!! :) !

A13LQ3QUJCIK13 B00AREIAI8 5 1402444800 39 This game is great, in the game you can get different horses compete and much more.In my experience in the game i personally like most competing, its great!  Ride the horse, feed it, and have fun with it! :)
A13LQH3MTHY67H B008Y0SERE 1 1391385600 27 I deleted this app almost immediately. I hated it and I didn't understand it. Basically I was board out of my mind... Do not get this app!
A13LQH3MTHY67H B00846GKTW 4 1338681600 22 I think it's a good fun game and if you have a taste for fasion it's for you give it a try
A13LQH3MTHY67H B00E1GOGJK 5 1384128000 28 This app is fun for all ages. It is pretty challenging and I LOVE it it gives me something to do and I say again SOOOO much fun!!!!!!!!!!
A13LQH3MTHY67H B009UX2YAC 5 1363392000 22 This game is sooo fun and addictive if you don't already have this game you really should trust me you'll love it

A13LV18ZTFDQHG B00ED4TX2A 4 1398556800 35 This game is very cute. I AM ONLY about level one through but I love it! I am no spring chicken and not a gamer....this is fun!!!!! Try it out. Update when play longer too!
A13LV18ZTFDQHG B007NACZPI 4 1332460800 48 This game is so cute and fun too!  was skeptical after reading this morning's reviews for FAOTD glad I tried it. When it comes to buying anything I probably won't, but so far have not had to and ive been playing for a wee bit now. try it!
A13LZDDAGQ6KDB B00EEL0LGY 2 1396569600 58 Just deleted game for good reason. Every time I try to restart while racing my kindle bugs out and actually freezes and shuts itself down obviously no else seems to know this but I'm not keeping a game that bugs this bad good thing it was free right now otherwise I would be asking for my money back
A13LZDDAGQ6KDB B00I8Q77Y0 3 1393545600 32 I'm not a big fan of flappy bird but I guess this is an ok game by itself I wonder when Nintendo will sue all these people for stealing there mario art.
A13LZDDAGQ6KDB B00B7Y0206 3 1393718400 32 This was very good at first and it plays videos well but now there's a bug and now it doesn't work instead it just loads forever in the video please fix this
A13LZIYDNNMNHV B00FAPF5U0 5 1383177600 45 I was so happy when I saw that candy crush was on the kindle.  I had been waiting,patiently for it to come. I am addicted to this game like hundreds of other people.  Now I have it on my phone, my kindle and my laptop.
A13LZIYDNNMNHV B00E8KLWB4 4 1392076800 54 I have only been playing this game for a few days.  So far I really  like it.  It keeps you occupied for quite awhile.  More interesting than most of the garbage on television lately.  If you are looking for a game that is interesting and fun this may be what you are looking for.
A13LZIYDNNMNHV B00DLJ31HQ 4 1377561600 20 Fun game.Really like this game.  Have only completed one level so far so l will submit a better review later.
A13LZIYDNNMNHV B00CWY76CC 4 1373760000 35 Like the games.  They are different but interesting.  Fun way to pass the time,some of them are a little  complicated but they definitely make you use some brain power which is always a good thing..
A13M18P55AS9J B00CWY76CC 5 1375401600 23 I love this game it keep you on your toes. I can't wait for more levels so I can get back at it.
A13M18P55AS9J B004OG7XY2 5 1381881600 25 This is a great game, my dad tought me how to play Chess when i was really young and I have loved the game since.
A13M38FQP3J73 B00B2V66VS 3 1371340800 20 Haven't played this one very much.  I'm still trying to learn when and when not to jump and slide, etc.
A13M38FQP3J73 B00BHHIWQO 5 1371340800 20 I enjoy playing this game.  It is easy and like the game on my pc and it didn't cost much.
A13M38FQP3J73 B008NX8OCM 4 1371340800 22 This is a good game that makes you think too.  It is good on the Kindle Fire and didn't cost a lot.
A13M8EJPJZHJIQ B0063IH60K 5 1371340800 25 Anyone that loves playing solitaire will enjoy this software..The only thing I could do nicely without are the ads that are part of this software
A13M8EJPJZHJIQ B0066T8OH0 5 1360800000 30 love, love, love this game.  Play several games just about every day.  The onlybad thing I can think of is that I, personally spend much too much time playing it.
A13M8NON73MDUR B004SBS8LA 5 1331424000 46 At first I could not understand why all my fellow co-workers were sitting around playing angry birds all the time, so I went and bought the original. NOW I OWN THEM ALL!!! I love this game and play it every chance I get!! A must have!
A13M8NON73MDUR B0069Y4E08 5 1327104000 94 There isn't an Angry Birds game that I don't like! When I saw this HD version I just knew I had to have it! It was not what I expected though. There is a SLIGHT difference in size of some of the visuals,but when playing the original side by side with the HD there is not a whole lot to justify paying the $4 extra. My opinion..just stick to the .99 cent version, but at the same time I love Angry Birds so much I am glad I added it to my collection! :-)
A13MA6YULAYQ67 B00DHKKN6Q 4 1397433600 21 I like this game but its hard to aim. pretty fun overall and its very challenging after the first few levels
A13MA6YULAYQ67 B007ZGO7EM 5 1339372800 27 This is the greatest calculator ever!  Large easy to read numbers with many practical functions and features!  Better than my regular calculator by far! Must have app
A13MA6YULAYQ67 B0062R5GJ0 5 1342137600 23 great app if you need a quick and handy calendar to keep up with appointments. It has one time or recurring  appointment functions.
A13MA6YULAYQ67 B00EBE8MUG 5 1382400000 21 lots of fun if you're a Tv junkie! pictures are a bit grainy but most are no problem to figure out.
A13MA6YULAYQ67 B008IJTFYW 5 1358899200 48 Not only does it have a large and really great selection of sounds but you can mix them. You just choose which ones you want together but you can also set the volume on each individual sound as well as the master volume. Best sound machine app EVER!!!!!
A13MBE8MVDISFF B00AB7HESI 4 1382745600 30 I liked the game when I didn't complete all the levels but when I was done with all the levels it wasn't fun anymore and I don't play it anymore.
A13MEJIK954QGT B009UWL580 5 1359158400 29 This game is a lot of fun it's not super hard to get the prizes. Time passes quickly because I just want to keep trying for more and more!
A13MEJIK954QGT B00B3WD78Q 5 1362528000 33 This is one of the most addictive games ever! I keep playing just to try for a higher score...I have a hard time putting this game down. I would highly recommend this one!
A13MEJIK954QGT B0064X7B4A 5 1364860800 21 This is the best app if you love word games. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Try it...you'll like it!
A13MEJIK954QGT B00A9VD67E 5 1363478400 25 there is a lot of different types of games to play...some hard....some not....you definitely have to try this app! It is a lot of fun!
A13MFZE7P4J2LL B00881VLCE 3 1384214400 91 The puzzles are pretty, fun and interesting. It is good that they allow you to increase the amount of pieces you can play, allowing everyone in the family to play. However, I have had to delete and reload the app on my Kindle H D X three times so far, just to be able to continue playing it at all.  After playing it for 5 or 6 games it gets slower and slower u until it just stops altogether.  Very frustrating.  If you don't mind reloading every 6 games, it's fun.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00DYY92MG 4 1379376000 21 Has a pretty wide range of shows to guess so far. It's not my favorite game, but I do enjoy playing.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00AO0JH0K 5 1362009600 51 This app has REALLY decent group playability. It's a lot of fun to play with family and friends and try to beat each other out to guess the icons first. Also a really good time killer. Fun to play over and over again, and the graphics are really nice on it.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B009UX2YAC 5 1360972800 43 This game is a ton of fun! It has several goals to reach both in game goals and personal goals (I.e.&#34;I'll make it further this time!&#34;) So it definitely gives you plenty of reason to keep coming back over and over. So fun!
A13MJELSF3T9PN B009LT1YZ6 4 1362009600 58 My favorite aspect of the game is the tilt features. I'm still relatively new to owning a kindle and so tilting and turning the device around to move is way awesome to me. The game play is entertaining. It's not to hard, but not always to simple either. All in all, a nice game to kill some time.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00IZJLRQE 4 1405814400 38 Not the best game I've ever played in my entire life, but super adorable and I've had no issues. Good game for kids or to pass time when bored. A great score in the FAOTD, thanks Amazon! :-)
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00B2V66VS 4 1364342400 158 It's a lot of fun. This is the first temple run game I've ever played, but i picked up. There is no story line to get lost in our anything so if you haven't played one you can still play this no problem. I also like how the other characters and upgrades are not impossible to earn. With some similar games I've played if you could get new characters it was extremely difficult, but in this one its not hard, I unlocked one after the first time i played. They get pricier as the game goes, but still attainable. I'm not giving five stars, because I reserve those for games and things I can't put down and go a day without. This one, while super fun, is still just a time killer type game. It does offer a lot to come back and play again for, but you won't be miserable if you miss a day or two.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00ESCOI7C 4 1379376000 92 It's a perfect time killer and the perfect game for when you have only a few minutes to play. It's challenging to a point, but not so overly difficult you can't play. It has easily attainable hints of you do get stuck and its not to hard to build your coins back up for more so that's a plus as well. Only giving four out of five stars as there are many other logo games out there so the concept isn't original but this one is definitely one of my top choices.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00B49Z8TY 3 1362009600 107 At first I really liked it, it just seems to me with these Me girl games you can only get so far into the game without putting actual money into them. I was doing really well, then I got to one level I competed about four times and kept using my coins to buy new stuff to try to pass it, that's when I realized it was wanting me to actually buy clothing for it. I don't mind spending money to buy an app in general, but I don't like the ones that pretend to be free until you start playing and her addicted. It's not right.
A13MJELSF3T9PN B00BFUC8RC 5 1362355200 92 I'm not a huge 5 star rater, I usually go with four unless I find something just absolutely amazing. This game is SO much fun. It's colorful, energetic, bright, and just absolutely addictive. The only thing in the game I can see that costs actual money so far is if you want to buy extra coins, but there is really no need as they provide you several in game ways to earn coins, as well as social media ways (liking on Facebook, pairing with Twitter, etc.). This game is a MUST have.
A13MK5YFDHFTNX B008PUK8H2 5 1348963200 33 Lots of fun this game is so addicting you will loose track of time. I think it is a great idea to play against other people. I will definitely buy the full version
A13MK5YFDHFTNX B007SYWFRM 5 1334620800 39 I love this game!!!  My whole family has seen all the movies and we can't wait for the next one. The only problem I am having is getting neighbors Can someone help? Still love the game its a keeper.
A13MK5YFDHFTNX B007V2UGPE 5 1340409600 27 Love the game I play it every day but it does freeze up every so often  and also gets choppy but it is still fun to play.
A13MLG39C0LKST B008YOBYNG 4 1363910400 30 Works well. No freezing or locking up, like a lot of new games. No big wins but they keep enough coming so you can keep playing. Liking it a lot.
A13MLG39C0LKST B00B4VI8MQ 4 1384041600 21 Great graphics. Good story line. A lot of hidden object games and not much running around. Very enjoyable. Worth the money.
A13MLG39C0LKST B005UQ9FNC 5 1325635200 22 Lots of mindless fun.Works great on Kindle Fire! Great for a time waster.  Waiting for an appointment has never been more fun.
A13MLKXW68V0BJ B008V06NRU 5 1368230400 23 I love this game because if you don't have a pet, it's like a vertual pet. Listen, take it from me, I'm only
A13MLKXW68V0BJ B00CWY76CC 4 1379808000 32 The game is hard but fun. It's frustrating though because you run out of levels. Otherwise, pretty fun/difficult. Get this app if you are good at mystery stuff or like hard things.
A13MLKXW68V0BJ B008JK6W5K 4 1347753600 51 this game takes some time to think about. if ur a couch potato and know pretty much everything about companies because u watch so many commercials, this is the game for u. otherwise, if u don't know what something is, u can look it up on the internet. still, good game.
A13MSG9QXC4G4F B00IKZX1ZI 1 1400457600 103 I have been having issues with the app freezing and shutting down which is frustrating to the max. I don't know if it is because I'm running on a first addition Kindle Fire, otherwise it is fun. I'm adjusting my rating of this game as this is the fourth or fifth time it either froze or just shut down in the middle of a game costing me a power up that I paid for.  Think I'm just going to remove it now and they can gather their money from others. This last shut down occurred when they were updating the program, very disappointed.
A13MSG9QXC4G4F B00FAPF5U0 2 1383955200 25 I don't have facebook nor do I want one so to play I have to pay. To many games available that don't drain your wallet.
A13MSG9QXC4G4F B00ET0PZDO 5 1379548800 23 Found this to be super easy until 9th level then you had to give it some serious thought can't wait for next level.
A13MSG9QXC4G4F B00IYOACQ6 5 1396396800 47 I found this to be fun challenging and a good use of problem solving to get from one room to the other.  Some I found easier than others and of course, like most escape games they get more challenging as you get further along in the game.
A13N1XVVR6O6VQ B00A8ECU24 3 1371254400 35 My kids and I really like this game. It's really cute. The problem is it's quite buggy and rarely connects to other people's ponyvilles on social media. Since some tasks require that it's really annoying.
A13N1XVVR6O6VQ B007PT3QOQ 4 1368662400 27 This game can be a bit buggy but it totally makes up for it with fun. Once you get going you level up quickly. It's quite addictive!
A13N1XVVR6O6VQ B00CO6TOBY 4 1375747200 59 I was once so very addicted to tetris. I was really happy to find it for free! The new version is just as addicting but the way you rotate pieces in this version is so different. That's the reason for a 4 out of 5. But who knows, after some more time I may come to understand it better.
A13N1XVVR6O6VQ B00E78QIDE 5 1376006400 31 This app is great for family road trips and just plain downtime. I love that it doesn't require internet. And being able to ask for help on facebook is pretty neet.
A13N6L63ECVGDM B00GIZO674 4 1402876800 27 I love this game but when I got to the city I had to pay for it. It was disappointing, but I decided to get it anyway
A13N6L63ECVGDM B00IZLM8MY 5 1402876800 59 I liked this  game because it never crashed,you get coins easily and its fun!You can change a name and characters appearance unlike campus life and you Don't get money as easily on campus life as well. And campus life is so pricey when you have to pay diamonds for everything. I would recommend this game over campus life  anyday
A13N9D61HDQJI2 B00D2XD5JU 4 1390262400 21 Fun game, it is simular to Candy Crush except it is fruit. I really like it, would recommend it to all.
A13N9D61HDQJI2 B004SJ3BCI 5 1363737600 25 My youngest grandson of 4 yrs. loves this game and he plays it whenever he is here. He down loads other free games as well.
A13NCZ6GFX3KYY B009HN0V6E 5 1386892800 32 My dad won't let me get it but I appreciate how you put alot of work into the app an  I really appreciate it I would get it if I'd could :)
A13NCZ6GFX3KYY B00992CF6W 4 1393286400 19 Plz add more updates like villagers, hunger, ocelots,wolves PLZZ It's boring now :(Just more of that good stuff :)
A13NCZ6GFX3KYY B00FT8FRO2 4 1384992000 23 It lags alot when I try to put in server port and the name and always freezes but I guess it's pretty fun
A13NCZ6GFX3KYY B0052AZJV8 1 1379203200 22 Idk everyone's giving bad opinions about stalkers and creepers. Ya I'm good I just wanna skype my friend on my kindle :(
A13NI1XE7M4LVS B00IK1NTCW 5 1393977600 50 I would give this app five stars except that it lacks a very important feature.There is no way to get your data OUT of it.No Share menu. No File menu.No way to export drawings.----This is no longer the case. I'm more than happy to now give this tool five stars.
A13NI1XE7M4LVS B008WXNBWG 5 1345593600 43 I've bought snd tested every note/reminder/task app I've bumped into.I like this, a lot.Notes can be overlapped, stacked, pushed off screen.Use is simple and fast.Would like to see a wastebasket and multiple desktops, but that doesn't keep me from giving it five stars.
A13NI1XE7M4LVS B006SMLAMQ 4 1332115200 33 Not sure what the fuss about size is; it's 484 K installed. Pretty, but lacks radar or satellite images. The Weather Channel and Accuweather apps are probably a better pick for most users.
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B0071Q75AO 1 1329523200 22 this app is the stupidest thing ever if u thought this could actually work it doesn't so ur prolly stupid woo yea
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B0067Q42BY 5 1329609600 24 I got mine for free, from the free app of the day on the kindle fire, so far its great and I love it!
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B006KX3GXO 5 1332806400 22 PicsArt is very fun I take pics  and upload them then edit them its soooo much fun and free which is awesome!
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B006D1ONE4 5 1333497600 22 its so much fun I don't really know what else to say about it its purty good I just saying hi noway!
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B0067Q4RCI 1 1329609600 23 it looks fun but it is way, way, way over priced! I wouldn't pay 5 bucks for an app cause its just stupid!
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B005HK1JFS 5 1329955200 21 I love it its so fun when ur bored and want to play an easy game. and its easy to winne!
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B005ZFOOE8 5 1338076800 41 for me it doesn't need facebook to save if you have an email then you can make an account and it will automatically save the playlist. so for all you saying &quot;great untill you needed facebook to save&quot; -get an account-
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B0054JZC6E 5 1329004800 22 I love this game me and my sister compete against each other to see who gets a higher score. I love it!
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B0073V0FC2 2 1335398400 21 it can be good at points but sometimes its annoying when the game goes on and on u never win!  &euro;:
A13NJ8IZWG5R7P B005HB4F08 1 1330128000 21 at one check point there is no way to get it so I got mad&lt;_&gt; and no one can pass it
A13NJKEU2SUBJC B00DJFIMW6 5 1373673600 22 Absolutely LOVE this game..The lil minions are so cute...Its fastly becoming my favorite game....It makes me feel better when I'm feeling down....
A13NJKEU2SUBJC B006OBWGHO 5 1346803200 25 love this game.the puzzles are mind boggling and fun..the graphics are so cute.even my grandson loves this game.if you like puzzles games..you'll love this game
A13NJKEU2SUBJC B009OA3TQ4 4 1372377600 22 some of the puzzles are really hard to figure out..the angle at which you play is a bit confusing..its an okay game
A13NKVA0SRAYBA B004LOMB2Q 5 1340409600 23 Great application for Bible studying! I use it often while talking notes, and its great for sharing information with others as well. thanks!
A13NKVA0SRAYBA B004VMUS9G 5 1352073600 25 Nice app I lime the ability to use downloaded music as an alarm. I also am very pleased with the alarm that increases in volume.
A13NKVA0SRAYBA B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393286400 21 nice game. it is challenging and exciting. I am addicted and I can't. stop playing. my friends all have great scores
A13NOAAEXA55NT B004SCG69A 4 1332028800 20 this is a pretty good game. you cant beat the price. its worth getting, especially if you like strategy. cool
A13NOAAEXA55NT B008AVPMLI 3 1341619200 46 i need to be connected to wifi to play? unacceptable. i get that it free and appreciate it, but why would i possibbly require to be online to play it? c'mon guys you make great games, why do you feel the need to screw that up?
A13NOAAEXA55NT B007NACZPI 4 1332547200 22 pretty decent game, its nice not having to be logged into face book to play this type of game. worth trying out.
A13NOAAEXA55NT B00APKHA9Y 5 1361577600 64 Excellent FPS for kindle fire HD. Plenty of weapons, items, character upgrades and missions to waste your life away with. Storyline is ok, but im just here for the wholesale slaughter. The zombies arent particularly creative. There are regular, fast, spitters and armored. I imagine there are others being that im not that far into the game.... guess ill find out, or die trying....
A13NOAAEXA55NT B005ZUR724 4 1344988800 32 other than not having a proper guide to controls, its a great game. a solid mmo that is portable. ill change rating to a five star if they add a guide book.
A13NOAAEXA55NT B0055SWM08 5 1331942400 21 I love a game that makes you think and this one delivers. I hope to see more from Fallen Tree Games.
A13NOAAEXA55NT B004TP2E7O 4 1332288000 28 Takes a little getting used to on the kindle fire, but a very good game once you do. I would definately recommend for those who like mindless shooters.
A13NOAAEXA55NT B0054JZC6E 5 1329955200 21 the concept is great, forces you to try new kinds of games you normally would ignore. that alone keeps it interesting.
A13NOAAEXA55NT B006RA13BW 5 1333411200 58 this app was designed for small childeren and helps relax autistic ones. its right there in the description. if you're to lazy too read one paragraph, at least be too lazy to review something that even a small child knows wasnt designed for you. i gave this app 5 stars and never downloaded it to offset undeserved negativism.
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00AOA9BL0 5 1386633600 28 Love the app and love that can watch a show on my kindle while my kids watch the tv and I can take my showed everywhere I go
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00E4MCCF6 5 1388966400 40 Love all the different puzzle pictures and love how easy it is to move the w h ole puzzle as one big piece and not have it fall apart.  Also love to hear a clicking sound when the pieces match.
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B008XG1X18 5 1382227200 37 Crafty person and teaching preschool and this app go hand and hand.  I love having it on my Kindle and pull up my crafts for school on their and on my phone.  I am a pinterest addict
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00BYJ6BUO 5 1382227200 106 I love this App!  I don't always get to watch my DVR shows because of my kids watching the tv so it is nice to sit with my kindle and watch it whenever I want too.  Love all the easy listing of the shows and the lay out.  Sometimes and I don't know if it is on my end or their end it says the app has failed and to restart the app.  But after a couple of times it works just fine.  Like I said I don't know if it is on my end or theirs but it makes it worth the starting and stopping!
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00DUZKE4O 5 1388016000 21 Love all the good movie choices.  Love all the levels too.  Fun and easy to play alone or with my kids.
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00CELIPL4 5 1382227200 29 Had a lot of fun finding all the hidden things.  Some of the were hard to find but had a blast and still play it.  Want more levels though!
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00F3W1GAS 4 1382227200 32 I like it a lot but thought that there should be more levels but had a blast finding them and had fun with my 5 year old looking for all the stuff
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B004H2MGOU 5 1382227200 30 My kids loved this little game and learned how to play tic tac toe really good!  A must have for little ones learning how to play without all the paper.
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00B9AGS42 5 1382227200 63 This one by far is my favorite Hidden Game.  I love all the levels and you can chose to have hints or not too.  Makes it time you play it different.  I will here in a little while go back and play all the levels again.  Also love the fact that they say there is more levels coming!  A plus in my book!
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B008R9OIUO 4 1382227200 45 I love this game but was a little sad that I couldn't go much farther then the free part unless I wanted to buy some more points or spend my money.  I loved it had had a blast just wish there was a free option.
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00B7Y0206 5 1382227200 24 Love this app and my almost 3 year old can use to really good to see the videos that she want so to see.
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00BXOAX40 5 1390521600 32 Love all the colors of the game and the fact you can see where all the balls are going with the dots and love the easiest of the first level.  Great game!
A13NTMUI7LCYD3 B00DUVQIIY 4 1382227200 27 Had a great time finding all the hidden objects.  Thought I could have more levels though but still had fun and still play it off and on.
A13NUF7TMAZ1OH B00FMRWEAA 4 1388361600 40 This is a pretty okay game, nothing to write home about. It's a good time waster. I would like it more if a lot of the items didn't take so many gems to purchase but oh well. Add me: NT74Z
A13NUF7TMAZ1OH B00AREIAI8 3 1362787200 25 It's an okay app. There is nothing special about it, but the kids have fun with it. It would be better without the &quot;gem&quot; system.
A13NUF7TMAZ1OH B00CC59H8W 2 1366848000 31 This game was a great time killer, but it has a lot of glitches. It kept closing out and deleting my progress. It was too much of a hassle to continue.
A13NUF7TMAZ1OH B0064X7FVE 1 1374796800 34 I loved the former version of this app. This new updated version is just awful! It's caused nothing but problems on my kindle. I have deleted it and will be looking for something different.
A13NWDZNM69VS6 B008LXN9II 1 1344038400 34 downloaded it but it doesn't work. my screen is blank /black when I open this game. a bit disappointed cause I love hidden object games &amp; was willing to give this one a shot..
A13NWDZNM69VS6 B0087HEQ6M 3 1345334400 27 so far so good. a few glitches here and there but game is okay. Its not the best game out there but its a good time waster....
A13NWDZNM69VS6 B007F2EGFQ 3 1334016000 21 game progresses slowly,  but other than that is ok. some quests take days to complete which can be a little annoying.
A13NYITAFLF36M B009C7ZQM4 5 1385510400 33 The app delivers. My kindle fire runs much better every time I clean it. It does a great job of cleaning out junk files that will slow your fire down. I recommend it.
A13NYITAFLF36M B008XAKC98 1 1385078400 29 app does not work. videos freeze up in the middle of a show. I uninstalled the app &amp; tried installing again. app still freezes up. too many ads. delete.
A13O1O01V8VH5N B0086700CM 5 1385164800 25 I love this game. it is a great game to everyone its a little addictive but its just like a real fun game should be
A13O1O01V8VH5N B00B2V66VS 5 1363392000 26 I like temple run 2 better than every game  because it is so adventerest and exiting magical I recamand this to people who like adventerest things
A13O1O01V8VH5N B00DJFIMW6 5 1389916800 20 it is so fun i &lt;3 the game  its a little addicting but  the good addicting u  should get it
A13O1V444DD5D8 B006MI4JEM 5 1363824000 22 Dropwords is a lot like the game of Bookworm..and I can sit and play  this game for hours.  I highly recommend it.
A13O1V444DD5D8 B0063GORYU 5 1363824000 21 This is a game I play when I want to  relax. It is a solitare that is a challenge to do.
A13O1V444DD5D8 B008JGSM6G 3 1368662400 20 I thought  this would be a snap but  the further I  go in the levels the harder the puzzle. Thanks
A13O1V444DD5D8 B00A4EZ3QS 4 1374451200 26 I play this game when I want to settle in bed. It is relaxing and fun. I was looking for Candy Crush when I found this..
A13O1V444DD5D8 B0066T0BTO 5 1363824000 21 I have had this game for years..It is very relaxing to play and move up levels. I highly recommend this gane,
A13O1V444DD5D8 B0063GSL60 4 1368662400 29 This is a very relaxing game. I  like the challenge that it gives me..and sometimes I have to start a whole new game .Thanks for  offering Free Cell .
A13O1V444DD5D8 B0050KDTSK 4 1374451200 52 It is not what I was looking for when I found  it but since I downloaded it has been fun. Kind of childish I like Hay Day a whole lot better there is more movement on it. Wish I could get it ( Hay Day) on my Lap top. Why can't I???
A13O1V444DD5D8 B00CH26TL8 5 1374451200 23 I like the game a lot. It is a challenge for me to try to get all the bubbles down and get stars....
A13O1V444DD5D8 B0064X7FVE 5 1363824000 21 I love knowing I can see what the weather holds for me in my area. It is so easy to review...
A13O1V444DD5D8 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383177600 20 I love this game! it is a game so intriguing...I like  playing  and comparing scores  This game is very addicting.
A13O1V444DD5D8 B008NCUFYS 5 1363824000 22 This game is a lot of  fun. I highly recommend  this game to adults andchildren I am so glad I found it.
A13O8UEPSG5TI8 B006GECE9Y 1 1385251200 62 Will not work on kindle fire Amazon has made a huge mistake not having flash player for the 8.9 hd kindle & not allowing to use web browsers that support it. When so many games & websites use it.Can't use it on kindle fire this is why 1 star. It was just what I needed to play my games thanks Amazon kindlefire
A13O8UEPSG5TI8 B00BOUROR2 3 1369785600 27 This is a okay game don't really play it much when I play these games more I will share if I think it is better than ok
A13OAO2OWNY16B B0078EHIKG 1 1343865600 22 this app is lame! it is not a good app at all!! just take my advice. DO NOT GET THIS STUPID APP!!!

A13OE961PNHIIY B00AREIAI8 5 1377820800 42 My horse is a very fun game. It has amazing graphics. And it is fun for kids. I would say between the ages 4 to 15 to have fun with this game. Not to hard, not to easy, it's just right.  :)
A13OE961PNHIIY B0064X7FVE 5 1373846400 30 I love it. It has a a forecast for the whole week!! And when the power goes out, you can always look at what's happening. Love it. 5 stars. :D
A13OE961PNHIIY B00DS86XPM 5 1391904000 21 OMG I AM A HUGE ELVIS PRESLEY FAN! AND I DREW ELVIS OMG!! LOVE THIS APP!GET IT NOW!! SO COOL!! :D
A13OK0I1EQECM5 B007AL48UK 5 1377475200 28 My 5 year old grandson and I both enjoy it.  It is easier for him because the characters are familiar to him/us.  I enjoy the traditional Mahjong, too.
A13OK0I1EQECM5 B00DFW3818 2 1377475200 33 If I didn't know the song, it give no hints, no verbal cues, no alternatives and I cannot move past the song I don't know to a new song.  So its rather pointless.
A13OK0I1EQECM5 B00BGDEK9C 4 1402790400 35 Another addictive game... reminds me how much I loved to go bowling years ago!  I have been on leagues in the past and I'm thinking about finding another.  Watch out...you can play this for hours!
A13OK0I1EQECM5 B008JK6W5K 4 1363478400 33 It scares me to think that I am so familiar with all the advertising, but it's true.  Yikes.  It just proves how bombarded we are and how omnipresent these logos are. Fun though.
A13OK0I1EQECM5 B008VAGGWM 3 1377475200 23 It is fun and takes some patience and skill but I prefer more fast paced games when I am numbing my mind.  LOL!
A13OL3PG7T82PP B005HSL626 5 1392768000 84 Hi it's me RockStar:):):):) and well let me say.... AWESOME wow it's so addicting too. Must have if your a mom with kids who have a short attention spans I'm twelve so I wouldn't know so please enjoy this app.WAIT! There are some things that you should know one, adds so far none inappropriate ones. But you get new swords by getting star fruit so I recommend you get this plus remember I'm your friend so trust me please.From, RockStar:):):):)To all my gamer friends!
A13OL3PG7T82PP B00HEVJU7W 5 1391817600 61 Ha ha sooooo funny laugh my butt off omg I suggest to mom's and 11 year olds to get this hilarious appAnd from your super awesome friend Rock Star:):):):) please don't get me confused with other peopleI'm awesome . So are you guys all my gamer friends known or not. Get this app please it's a riot!From the totally awesome RockStar:):):):)
A13OL3PG7T82PP B009HKL4B8 3 1391385600 71 I do soooo love this game it is hard to accomplish the tasks money is hard to get money. Now to some important details one, you cannot fast forward time so it's long and a bit boring. Next I would suggest you do purchase this app if you like SIM games this is very fun. I hope you enjoy this app. To all my game friends known or not.From, Rock Star:):):):)
A13OL3PG7T82PP B00992CF6W 5 1391299200 69 Ok I do enjoy minecraft pe what can I say I'm a gamer girl! Now to the point. It is fun I built a plane in creative mode I don't really enjoy survival you might say I'm lame but it takes time out of crafting andLess materials stink. I suggest this game for minecraftians ( minecrafters) children might get board, a note to mom's.Please get this app!From,Rock Star :):):):)
A13OL3PG7T82PP B00HHAAWX6 4 1391299200 111 Ok this is an epic game now I'm going to be me Rock Star  and tell you I'm like 12 and a half years old so I'm not a mom BUT I believe this is a good game for 8 to 10 year olds I'm positive your kid will enjoy this especially kids who like cats and village games. It is pretty fun but a challenge to get money to complete goals. Ok again with mini mom I most note it does ask you if you want to join it on Facebook so make sure you tell whoever's playing to not touch it.I don't even have  a Facebook! From,Rock Star :):):):)
A13OLS8VC4WE9Z B00BI0LR94 5 1398729600 20 just what I remembered. enjoyed watching these rooms again. well worth the money. order this one and enjoy remembering .
A13OLS8VC4WE9Z B0062QUNHG 5 1367107200 20 Words from the Bible and what they mean to you and your daily life. Will help you through your day.
A13ON81P25CC75 B009GXHOW4 1 1358985600 32 This app would be amazing if it worked. I can not get it to work if it does. There is no directions or help bar for you. How does this app work?
A13ON81P25CC75 B008Y7SMQU 5 1358985600 30 Logo Quiz is so addicting. It might not seem fun but after a while you can not pit it down. Best of all it is free. You should download this.
A13ON81P25CC75 B00AIQP9DE 5 1357516800 26 Extremely well built this game is the best  G5  map so far. It is worth the money ( full version). This is a must get game.
A13ON81P25CC75 B00AMPALV6 4 1383350400 42 I deleted this game once but I regretted it. This game is amazing. It doesn't waste to much of your time but it is so fun. The only problem with this is that it needs a better animation sequence when fighting online.
A13OOEGETGESYE B00BYG0RSE 5 1395532800 50 This is an epic app! It's easy to be creative and fun, it's totally worth the- on yeah, it's free! There's plenty of options as to what you can do, and the graphics are very pleasant and relaxing. It's just a cute game, and its fun for anyone who's bored.
A13OOEGETGESYE B00I8Q77Y0 5 1394150400 34 Awesome game! I don't know why but it's much more fun than flappy bird. Download is worth it. It's much more entertaining with the various colours of bird you get. Have an excellent day!
A13OOEGETGESYE B00ANUMR1W 5 1389830400 20 You can waste hours on this game, it's addicting and fun. I love it, and I hope you will too.
A13OPQVL845Q2Z B00DJ075FQ 5 1374451200 23 This is a fun game. I love playing mahjong and this is great. I got the full version because it was so fun.
A13OPQVL845Q2Z B005ZFOOE8 5 1384560000 21 I have a love for music of all kinds and this app hits the right spot for me  and my family-friendly
A13OPQVL845Q2Z B00BS3UFCQ 5 1367107200 20 this is a fun game. having my daughter help me with some of them.great game to get on the kindle.
A13OPQVL845Q2Z B00GNIJAEA 5 1389484800 20 This is a fun app to play with slot of stuff to post to Facebook  my wife loves  posting them
A13P1GFKTJEIT B0058EBNAO 5 1348012800 43 It took a little time getting used to the interface, but I do see how efficiently you are able to keep up with the weather now. I believe it's a must have for any phone and they keep updating it with customer's requests.
A13P1GFKTJEIT B0052UZIFA 5 1325462400 40 This game is awesome! strategic, while entertainment, and doesn't frustrate.  A must have.  I liked it so much, I had to buy it for the PS3 and gameboy as well.  I just wish they make a part 2 already. :)
A13P1GFKTJEIT B004R1LNGS 5 1330646400 69 Anyone who cares about their phone or their information must get SeekDroid.  It is very simple to use, it covers you fully (as in you can get to your phone online or through someone else's phone).  I'm not sure what I would do without Seekdroid, but I tell you I feel much better having this app on my phone and I be so do my friends as well. :)
A13P1GFKTJEIT B0058VW36U 5 1325462400 57 This game is so addictive, Great visual strategic game, very simple and short. What the doctor ordered for when you have 5 minutes to waist, or longer if you go through all the levels.  I love that now you can quickly slide to the other worlds, and it marks was worlds you have completed with all stars.
A13P1GFKTJEIT B004Q87AA0 1 1301788800 50 It lights up the flashlight, and the screen, maybe that's useful if you want to be found but not for using your phone as flashlight, you'll light up the path and your eyeballs at the same time.  And all the access it wants to your phone info makes no sense.
A13P1GFKTJEIT B00696GNC8 5 1325462400 54 The full interactivity of A Charlie Brown Christmas is awesome! the pictures are interactive, the narrations comes shows the words being read, the ability to go and click on each word to be read to you is great, the hidden ornaments is another huge plus.  Love it and would recommend for any kid reading.
A13P20O1GOG9TR B00808GTI6 4 1360800000 20 And not the car brand either - great shows, nice to see different stuff from the usual crap on networks
A13P2XHKUPD3U5 B004FRX0MY 1 1402790400 92 Since the update of Amazon mp3 player, many of the songs I purchased thru Amazon, and downloaded thru Amazon, will not play.  I get &#34;exception 119&#34; or other playback errors.  This is annoying in and of itself, but when using the player during a run or workout, it completely stops the player, meaning I have to finish the run/workout without music, or break my pace/concentration to skip to the next song.Getting a paltry number of &#34;free&#34; (for prime) songs to choose from doesn't override the inconvenience of a player that doesn't play.....
A13P2XHKUPD3U5 B00HRMNKWE 3 1399593600 21 Nice time waster...but VERYslow to respond to clicks when checking an answer....so slow that it makes the game painful to play.
A13P4QOQO1EQMN B00EUADLTS 1 1394064000 23 THERE IS NO POSTING. And you don't get notifications of mentions. Absolutely ridiculous!!!! Waste of time! I will be trying an alternate method
A13P4QOQO1EQMN B00IEBE7GK 5 1393891200 21 Great game!!!  Keeps you guessing and is actually scary!!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.  Can't wait for part three
A13P9ES4M55B3G B0067R0APK 4 1333411200 26 A great day way to track the weather where ever you go. would rate a 5, but having trouble changing my location on my widget sometimes.
A13P9ES4M55B3G B004SBQGHS 5 1334275200 21 this game so much fun and addictive. it takes a lot of will power to give it up.GREAT GAME. GREAT GAME
A13P9ES4M55B3G B004DPC5Y2 5 1352073600 47 I bought this for my to keep her busy when we are appointments or places where she can't run all over the place. It works in a way, she loves playing the game, but also gets very excited and loud sometimes. It is a winner with me.
A13P9ES4M55B3G B009NF54ZE 3 1363824000 42 I enjoyed the game. Some of the challenges were very hard. I only wish that there was not so much dialog. I was glad that I could skip that. Now there needs to be a new one where this one left off.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00F8GYC1Y 1 1405382400 89 ***Update*** I downloaded an update for the game and was then able to delete. I would still be careful though. There are an insane number of permissions for a game.I downloaded this as a faotd and loved it. It is a fun game. I love being able to play both sides of the force but when I finished playing, it won't get off my device. I CANNOT DELETE IT. I have tried everything short of factory resetting my kindle and I CANNOT get rid of this game. Buyer beware.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00FEMJF6O 3 1391990400 69 I love this game but it won't load at all. It opens the game but as soon as it opens it goes back to the loading screen. I play on my kindle fire and have it linked to facebook so I tried to play it on my computer and it started me over at the beginning. What is going on? Please fix it soon. I really like this game.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00DZYXTRY 5 1391817600 52 This game is wonderful. A great way to learn and not even feel like you are learning. Relaxing, great pictures...really a wonderful game. I bought it for my children but I am having so much fun playing it I haven't given it to them yet but I know they'll love it too.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00KWVZ750 5 1402531200 26 Angry birds did it again. Great game. Lots of fun. Easy to learn. I love being able to make weapons and train your birds. Highly recommend.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00BX42FLY 4 1397520000 44 You get 4 picture hints to guess a word. Some of the pictures seem a little out of place to me. Takes forever to earn coins and hints are expensive. All in all, good for taking a break and relaxing for a few minutes.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00FRM93FE 3 1389744000 37 No strategy or real thought required. Blind point and click and then if you really get stuck and click on the help button, it takes you to a walk through for a different version of the game.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00E6Z0THE 3 1397779200 154 Do not start this game unless you plan to start and finish it at once. It is too scattered to play for a bit and then come back later. Yes you can take notes, but for me it was too much to try to remember where I was when I came back to play. Some of the puzzles were frustrating because you have to back out of the puzzle to see if anything unlocked. I sat there and worked on one puzzle close to 30 minutes before I found out I was right all along, I just needed to back away from it before the door would open. Once I solved the puzzles and moved on to the next area I was given a message that made it sound like there was another level and then I was given the option to restart or exit. That is a terrible way to end a game.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00DHQ0MGQ 4 1394064000 24 Challenging but not too hard. Good graphics but I had to take off a star because the cats explode. A humorous matter of principle.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00JBNS6KS 1 1400457600 89 In the description it says the first world is free and the full version is 99 cents. Granted, it does say the full version is 3 more worlds but that is a lie. I opened the game today and it said world 9 is now available. Once you buy levels 2-4 it doesn't tell you how much the remaining levels are. Is it still 99 cents per 3 levels or each level? I'm not going to pay $5 or more for this game. Adjust the description or the game.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00FWPWNKS 4 1403136000 53 It is a fun match 3 game but they tried too hard to make it cute and made it annoying. When you make a good match, an encouraging banner pops up in the middle of the game and that is distracting. The music could also use some help. Other than that, nice game.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00G4NUQYM 3 1393718400 59 The game shows many levels named after plants, colors, etc (NO clue as to topic or difficulty of puzzles). Once you open 2, the others are 99 cents to open. Clues are very vague and many could have multiple answers. I love word games and play them all the time but this will not be one of them. Uninstalled.
A13PBE80S9TVYK B00G4A6VZS 5 1391817600 43 I got this as the FAOTD and had soooo much fun I immediately bought the Stack the States game. I can't wait for my kids to play these. (I'll just have to put it down first) This is a GREAT game for everyone.
A13PBY4TA888YJ B0066HA1A0 4 1327536000 25 downloaded and was able to start playing right away with the help of the tutorial. I am enjoying the little tasks set up for me.
A13PBY4TA888YJ B008878MQQ 4 1353888000 22 easy to play free play. only drawback is having to wait for more coins. lots of different machines to play on too
A13PBY4TA888YJ B009WJNXAE 4 1374105600 24 i like this bingo game and play it every day. i like that you can trade B's for coins. the callers voice is calm.
A13PC0OPDE91IY B005HSL626 4 1355529600 38 this is a fun game. a true time waster! have not played it in a while because my tablet stopped working. but a replacement is on the way. then I can get back to enjoying this fun game.
A13PC0OPDE91IY B0097HTPE4 4 1354060800 34 this is a very addictive game. it pairs some words together that you're thinking, no way those words go together. but its fun to try to match the works in less than 10 seconds.
A13PCJIIX3BE0C B004N2NWT2 5 1333324800 38 I LOVE this game!I know the name sounds a little off but it is a grate way to pass time.my friend recommended it to me so I bought it.now I play it everyday!this is defantely worth 99 cents.
A13PH26KDOOEKW B006OQKM6G 4 1329696000 22 I just got this and giving it a try so I can take a shot at shopping even smarter. It sounded great!!!
A13PH26KDOOEKW B0055DL1G4 5 1330992000 46 If there's one, only one, news app that you should have, it is this one!! I love the idea of having alerts fire off to let you know breaking news and the ease of its use. It is the best news app you need to have!!!
A13POFFULG7GA8 B008N3TLNI 1 1357084800 20 I am not a fan of interactive internet games and don't know how to get started playing this game.  Sorry
A13POFFULG7GA8 B0063GSL60 2 1395705600 21 I can't figure out the concept.  It is too hard to play.  I don't understand it.  Why is it all spades?
A13POFFULG7GA8 B00C7X0ZNU 1 1392595200 22 I have other games that I enjoy more than this.  the format does not interest me. I give it a thumbs down.
A13POFFULG7GA8 B0063GORYU 1 1395705600 20 I have no idea how to play this game or what the idea of it is.  Will not be playing.
A13POFFULG7GA8 B0064X7B4A 1 1357084800 22 Again, I am not particularly fond of interactice internet games and haven't been able to figure out how to play this game.
A13POFFULG7GA8 B0063IH60K 3 1357084800 22 I like playing this game but would like to know how to customize the game to make it a little more challanging.
A13POFFULG7GA8 B00GGQLZUG 4 1392595200 22 I like the number of options and the free spins that you get when you play.  I give it a thumbs up
A13PS4M9CN9XVD B00H2ZM1GC 5 1389484800 61 I plAY animal jam and this game is way better than sky high on sky high every gem equals 1 on this there is a selection of different worth. I plAY this almost everyday you earn granddaughter than on the Animal Jam site I love this app so much I can't  even describe! Anyways add me  my user is EmoPokeGirl24 .
A13PTY8O1T4SQN B009WO7NQO 5 1357689600 20 all I can say is love love love love love love and I would like more levels to play soon..
A13PTY8O1T4SQN B005ZXWMUS 5 1357689600 29 I have had this for ever and I love it ... so up to date and the best movies I Love it and I recomend to every one ..
A13PVHR90JC6CH B00F8H0LM2 4 1380067200 31 Love Angry Birds and this Star Wars option is fantastic.  The kids love it especially the Yoda.  I think they like it more than the first Angry Birds Star Wars game
A13PVHR90JC6CH B009HQ9UHC 5 1372204800 20 My kids love this and they get excited to build new cars, planes, whatever each level.  It is truly entertaining.
A13PVHR90JC6CH B00E46D1QQ 3 1380067200 24 it is ok, not my favorite.  very similar to other games but just has Mickie. If your kids like Mickey then go for it.
A13PWNL3RA62NG B00AA87JGU 5 1359763200 22 good game. very addicting. love all the puzzles on it. very confusing and make ls u wanna continue till you finish it.
A13PWRAEW1WMG6 B004LOMB2Q 5 1311897600 55 I use this app to track my hydro vegetable garden.  I can keep track of my progress with text, pictures, or sound.  It will also automatically upload your notes so if you have to wipe your phone it's all neatly backed up.I also use it for grocery shopping lists but that's not it's strong suit.
A13PWRAEW1WMG6 B0066T0BTO 4 1328918400 22 If you are looking for more Bejeweled action this will do the trick. Nice graphics, easy controls. Works great on EVO 4g
A13PWRAEW1WMG6 B004QJGPNM 4 1302652800 39 Nice fast game of football. Controls are fairly easy and responsive.  Graphics are great and sound is decent. Like to play it when I have some small free time. Does eat up my battery. No issues on EVO 2.2
A13PWRAEW1WMG6 B007PW1BZY 4 1336780800 44 Nice game app. Graphics are good. Game works like the card game.Disappointed with slowdown during game. Eats up the battery a bit too fast. Might be my brightness but it also eats battery on my tablet.No sounds or customization options. Pity.Samsung Epic 4G Touch
A13PXR5C74V91L B006C1DH92 5 1324944000 53 This is actually better than the original - it has more options for play and it's a lot of fun. I keep trying to beat my best scores and lose track of time. If you enjoy Fruit Ninja, this version is definitely worth downloading. Play and graphics are great on my Kindle Fire.
A13PXR5C74V91L B005VTS4EY 4 1331337600 30 Fun game, graphics are nice, and works great on my Kindle Fire. The animated faces are funny, and the cheering is cute. Overall, an entertaining game that passes the time.
A13PXR5C74V91L B00657H8XO 5 1336867200 115 I can't seem to stop playing this game! The graphics are beautiful and the controls are very responsive. The only downside to the app is its file size - it's huge. I have finished the game a few times and now am going back to beat my previous scores. I do wish that when you complete the last level that the game somehow ends and shows the high scores. Instead it stays on the map pointing at the last level...not as satisfying for me. I am playing on Kindle Fire, and it works perfectly - well worth purchasing. Word of warning though, don't expect to get anything else done once you get started...it's that addicting!
A13PXR5C74V91L B004ECDNJU 2 1328832000 52 I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire as the FAOTD - I tried playing, but couldn't get it work - couldn't find instructions for HOW to play other than a general description. I  The graphics are very nice, but apparently the controls are not. Uninstalled after getting too frustrated with the game.
A13PXR5C74V91L B0071QIN00 4 1328918400 57 I agree with the other reviewers, this works best on the Fire with the button controls. The graphics are good and it runs smoothly. All in all this is a great app and a lot of fun. The point of view, for me takes some getting used to, but that will get better with practice I'm sure.
A13PXR5C74V91L B006YFO31C 2 1334102400 109 Playing on my Kindle Fire - it has good graphics and seemed fun to play. The controls however are lousy. I would aim and it would not go anywhere near where I wanted it to. At first I thought I wasn't doing it right and would try to adjust but couldn't get it to aim correctly. This made the game extremely frustrating! I tried to make it work for a while but when I felt like throwing my game at a wall...I walked away. Improve the controls and make them more intuitive and I will give a better rating - this has a lot of promise...but was ultimately disappointing.
A13PXR5C74V91L B006GWE5PM 4 1328832000 21 Got as the FAOTD and have enjoyed playing - it is a little addictive, though trying to beat your previous scores!
A13PXR5C74V91L B005KMOP9K 1 1332892800 77 This seemed like fun for my Kindle Fire...but froze up, then forced closed in stage 2. Seems that this is an issue across the board looking at the other reviews. From what I did get to see, the graphics were good and seemed like the game would be interesting, but then again I wasn't allowed past stage 2. Uninstalling. Fix the bugs and I'll rate it based on the game itself. Bummer, cuz I love puzzle games!
A13PYJOWCGLVWO B00GP0G0IK 5 1396742400 23 Could not wait to have the time to get back to the game. Keep great games like this coming. I really enjoyed it.
A13PYJOWCGLVWO B00DWJBOI8 5 1397520000 29 I absolutely think that this game is Great. I love the mystery and suspense. I hardly ever play a game more than once but this game is an exception...RL

A13Q8F2PH26PAM B00B2V66VS 5 1359072000 39 This game is so addicting and I love how it makes time fly by so quickly. The new game features are fun especially the underground &quot;train&quot;. I notice the touch interference is a little different but it's all good.
A13Q8F2PH26PAM B007P8BMTS 3 1365120000 40 I know it's free but the ads are so distracting but besides that it's great. I didn't  have any problem loading the episodes. Now I can watch my favorite show for free and I don't have to miss any episodes.
A13Q8F2PH26PAM B009HUBJPO 1 1373760000 22 This is not free! You need a magic Jack account in order to use this. Don't download, it's a waste of time.
A13Q9FMHS483MD B007TO3JW6 4 1362614400 33 I enjoy playing the slots at the casino and this is one of my lucky slots. Enjoyable and a good practice game before the real thing.give it a spin you might like it

A13QA17US3R1FV B00ATDOVNK 4 1372809600 21 As a lover of hidden object games, I thought that this one was great. It had good graphics and good gameplay.
A13QA17US3R1FV B00CTQ6SIG 5 1372550400 57 I am a HUGE Simpson's fan and I was playing this on my android phone. It took up so much space, however, and my phone would freeze up. Grrr. I am super thrilled that I can play it on my Kindle Fire now. Keep on adding updates, but please don't make all the good things cost donuts!
A13QEWGWIDJR8U B00IIY2DP0 5 1405900800 21 This is the best app EVER even when it's bad it's good so that is why I gave it 55555 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&amp;!!!!!!!!!!&amp;!!!!&amp;!&amp;!&amp;!&amp;!&amp;!&amp;!AWESOME!!!

A13QHNDI7S0LGV B007EUADC4 1 1331856000 55 it would be a fun game if the controls made a bit more sense but when u turn it turns in a kind of tight arc and u always end up hitting stuff boost just makes u crash into more stuff and u cant really get on to most of the ramps overall sucky game
A13QHNDI7S0LGV B007MFEESK 4 1343174400 24 its fun if u want to chat and I think that they should make rooms just for chatting cuz more people would get it.
A13QHNDI7S0LGV B0069G5Z9K 5 1345593600 52 I've been waiting so long to buy this game and its finally here!! its so fun and addicting.

A13QL2WC93Y4XW B00G118LYY 2 1387756800 26 This game is great. But kind of a rip off because the world that you get to race in is really small. Not really cool.  /:(

A13QV5H93FNMDZ B008IJTFYW 5 1359158400 22 Had to get this after my son fell asleep to the beta test. Definitely a must have app for people with kids!
A13QV5H93FNMDZ B0088QGB7Y 1 1342915200 60 this is a super fun game i played it for hours when i installed it quit for a while, and when i tried to get in it to play some more it wouldnt load... i spent $5 too and now my whole little village is lost :( fun game but def needs to not crash for a 5 star rating..
A13QV5H93FNMDZ B00A8ECU24 4 1368921600 44 It's a pretty cute game. Wish everything didn't cost so many coins but like all apps there's in game purchase which I did LOL... I'll punch myself later for being impatient and spending real money on yet another app...passing the time....still fun though :)
A13QVQJMFL2NZL B00HDPT2RM 3 1390608000 35 the game was fun and kept me interested but it kept freezing my kindle or shutting itself down and restarting. every time I lost progress and had to re do puzzles I had already completed.
A13QVQJMFL2NZL B009WYCDZU 1 1356825600 70 Tried to buy this app for my fiancee as a Christmas gift. It did not work on the Kindle Fire. Too large a file to download. Why is it being sold as a Kindle Fire version if it cannot be loaded onto your device? Also have had nothing but problems with the device since trying to download the app. Removed it and hoping that will fix the issues. Very dissatisfied.
A13QVQJMFL2NZL B0066T8SDU 5 1374105600 41 I love this game! easy to play one person or with the family. we actually make a competition out of it. I need to wind down at the end of a long day and this is the perfect way to relax.

A13QXWEFO4WKT1 B006HXXJH0 4 1352851200 41 This puts a great twist on Mahjong by adding the barnyard animal noises to your matches.Its fun for kids as well as Adults.  I still try to get three stars for my timings, while listening to the mooing, quacking, and mewing.

A13R2FCYPSCO31 B00529IOXO 1 1353369600 35 The way it is set up is kind of hard to grasp.  Also text messages are often late to arrive and some that I sent took hours to get to their destination.  I deleted it.
A13R2FCYPSCO31 B00632HWOG 4 1353369600 22 This app gets the job done.  It's easy to navigate through the options.  Mail gets sent.  Mail gets recieved. Plain and simple.
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00AIUUXHC 4 1404345600 13 It's pretty fun and has some cool upgrades.  I really enjoyed this game
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00AJ1EWRM 1 1383868800 31 wont open on kindle fire hdx even though it says its compatible. I didn't anticipate this being a sweet game but if I can't even open it it's a HUGE disappointment.
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B004HXHVZ8 5 1383091200 37 I never use it to rent movies but it ties into vudu.com and I have a bunch of movies I've bought from Walmart... I'm able to watch these whenever I want as long as I have wireless!
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B006ZAY5GY 2 1404345600 53 Was confusing to use on my galaxy s3 and I wasnt sure if it was actually working or not.  My battery never really lasted longer or anything so I cant really say it works real well either... just not really impressed with the interface on this app... too complex for a simple concept.
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00CSR2J9I 5 1404345600 42 Fun Fun Fun game... It DOES take some getting used to and I dont know how well a younger kid would do playing this game... but for the teenager or the adult at heart this is a pretty fun game to play
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00GMSZCMK 3 1404345600 57 Well then... this is a different game for sure.  I kinda like it... but I'm not sure yet.  It seems like it's fun but it doesnt really have that 'addictive game' feel.  It's not necessarily one I sit and think about and cant wait to play again... It's not horrible, its fun... but it's not AWESOME either...
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B0081IWNYO 2 1383868800 30 meh.  I got it because it was free app of the day. but i really dont see where I could put this to use.  It works pretty good but... meh.
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00EQ0CKRQ 4 1404345600 24 pretty fun racing game... alot of them are all the same... this one isnt much different... it rates right up there with racing apps..
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00E1JZIGW 4 1383868800 27 Works good.  Wish there were more full shows available that Porter Ridge show is so funny and I wish I could watch full episodes on here. :(
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B009O5CLZY 4 1404345600 22 it's pretty fun... Not 'spend hours and hours and hours' fun... but it works alright for a fun little game to play
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00F54F1G4 4 1404345600 72 I'm not much of an RPG guy... thats kinda what this is.  I gave it 4 stars because the battles and whatnot are pretty fun so I'm assuming a RPG fan will enjoy the rest as well.  It' seems really well-rounded for a free app game and playing it on the Fire TV is always a bonus... I think you'll enjoy this game if you are an Action/RPG gamer... I'm just not.
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00BGDEK9C 5 1404345600 33 Fun game to play.  It has some pretty cool upgrades and stuff... different bowling balls do different things.  It adds a fun twist to the game the farther you get into the game.
A13R4XBM0O2IR5 B00KI5Q8X0 3 1404345600 38 I didnt really enjoy this game that much.  It's not a bad game it's just not my style.  It gets a neutral rating because it's not like it's horrible graphics or anything it's just not what I expected.
A13RBO6AO4OWQ8 B0058VW36U 5 1325548800 22 No problems on kindle fire and great graphics.It's a great puzzel game for all ages and I highly recommend this to people.
A13RBO6AO4OWQ8 B00AO2P3GA 5 1355788800 61 In my opinion its just fine the way this game is, its the best fps game on this market. If I were to fix anything it would be... to get money even in custom matches (because you can only get money in ranked matches). Probably not as much, but close. Don't think twice to get this game, its really worth it!
A13RBO6AO4OWQ8 B006D1ONE4 5 1325548800 34 It's a great puzzle game.If your a fan of Cut the Rope,then this is the game for you! Even though this game is targeted for a young age group.I recommend this to all ages.
A13RBO6AO4OWQ8 B006OC2ANS 5 1330473600 29 This is probably the best game for free right now on the amazon app store.This game has great graphics and easy controls.This is a must get for Kindle Fire.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B00CRLSN4U 5 1388793600 25 Love the &#34;Guess&#34; trivia games.  I also have.  Guess TV Show and this is just as fun.  Great to play with a group of friends.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B007NZV2HK 3 1388793600 23 This would be good for beginners.  I do it on occasion to pass the time.  My young nephews and nieces like playing it.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B007XKEY6Q 5 1369699200 27 So much easier playing on the tablet than my phone.  Enjoying playing.  Don't need to know how do draw well, just need the desire to have fun.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B00992CF6W 4 1369699200 24 I found this interesting.  I play in peaceful mode.  Enjoy creating houses with many rooms.  Unlike at home, each bedroom has it's own bathroom.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B00DYY92MG 5 1388793600 53 Makes you really think.  The newer shows are harder to guess because of all the cable channels.  Love remembering the old shows.  Fun to bring out at a party if you are stuck on something.  Everyone gets into it and can't wait for the next show to pop up to guess.  Highly recommend.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B00BGDEK9C 4 1369699200 23 Fun trying to beat my weekly average on my regular Friday night league.  My 10 year old nephew is better than I am.
A13RC4HP8NOFAV B00EYUCAV4 5 1388793600 26 I put this on my Kindle for my nieces and nephews to play when they stay over.  They like all the different things they can do.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00HDZ47KO 4 1389139200 113 I try to avoid apps that I love so much that I find myself staying awake until Jimmy Fallon comes on. But this one was downloaded in a weak moment and now...I have bags under my eyes. As long as I have Bingo bucks, I'm there. But you do run out and they urge you to just buy a few more with actual cash. I have a rule that I don't do that. Don't let the kids do it, so...I can't either. But while my Bingo bucks last, and they last awhile, I am there, pushing &#34;spin&#34; and sitting late into the night with the glow of my Kindle reflecting in my eyes.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00CLVQ8GG 4 1388880000 24 Nice little app. CAN BE AS EASY OR AS CHALLENGING AS YOU LIKE.TOOK ME A COUPLE OF SECONDS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00CXBSYVG 5 1393027200 31 I haven't been playing that long, but the Times I have, it's been flawless. The cards are nice and big, perfect for my kindle. Plenty of free money, energy and keys.
A13RE01422J8ZF B007SYXJXG 2 1374364800 129 I don't have Windows on my Kindle Fire so this app won't load. I do, however, have it on my laptop and am able to load it, but in truth, most of the things you'd like to watch, cost additional money. If you can wait to view your favorite programs until they air them, you might enjoy the app. for instance, &#34;American Pickers&#34; is on at a specific hour, so you have to wait to watch it when it airs, not on demand. I have Netflix and frankly, I like their movie selections better and they have a lot of free to watch movies for their subscribers. I also subscribe to Directv and have for years and years. While I love them at home, they suck on the road.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00FAPF5U0 5 1401926400 47 With all of the hype about candy crush, I fought the urge to run with the pack, but I was wrong. This app sloths my tired mind. I suck at it but that's what makes me keep playing. Someday I will rule the world of candy crush.Fern@statonsigns.com
A13RE01422J8ZF B0062X7QWO 4 1375142400 34 Some of these puzzles were simple and you could fly right through them, and some of them had you sitting up in bed way past your bedtime, trying to figure them out. Cute app.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00DT4GRTM 5 1390694400 77 I hate this app, but everyday, there I am, believing that today will be the day I master it. Can't help but wonder if some app tech out there is laughing their butts off because we all keep returning - like a moth to a flame. So very three hours, there I am, collecting my free plays and jumping into this fast paced app. Love it or hate it, you'll visit it as often as you can.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00CPOT3ZM 3 1375574400 20 The kids enjoy this mindless game. They clean, drill, pull, and brush these teeth more than they do their own.
A13RE01422J8ZF B00C2KWKIG 1 1391731200 24 I'm not much of a poker player, but this game lets you learn the game without the stress that you have in a casino.
A13RE01422J8ZF B006OBWGHO 4 1375574400 25 I watch my grand daughter go from easy levels to the more difficult and despite the challenge, she continues to try to conquer the level.
A13RGILRR5EYEF B004HM35RC 5 1325462400 33 This is a great time killer plus me and my sister compete to see who has the highest score.( I'm winning)  so yeah, i give this two thumbs up or five stars up.
A13RGILRR5EYEF B00529IOXO 5 1324944000 22 I downloaded this on my kindle fire and now i can text my friends family and more its great really really great
A13RGMW2P22E4N B009UX2YAC 5 1359849600 24 I love playing this game. Ive been playing non stop for about two weeks. It keeps me highly entertained. Keep making games like this
A13RGMW2P22E4N B006OC2ANS 5 1335916800 21 I really like this game. It sucks you in and keeps you wanting more. I would highly recommend it to anyone
A13RGMW2P22E4N B008Y2FRFO 4 1348531200 29 This game takes me back to my youth. I remember taking all my dads change out of his pockets when I would go to the arcade at the mall
A13RHPVZWN0UJ4 B0066T0BTO 5 1370044800 59 I chose this rating because it's the most entertaining game I've played!  Bejeweled 2's colors and shapes are bright and shine like realistic crystals.  The gems move with ease, with the touch or glide of a finger, and the puzzles challenge your mind to figure the best point-selection strategy.  I would recommmend Bejeweled 2 to anyone of any age!
A13RI9RED96Y4P B004N8W292 5 1377734400 68 This app is great.  I can compare versions and look stuff up without having to drag out a stack of books.  I am not confined to studying the Bible at home, so when I am out and about waiting on a doctor's appointment or something I can still spent time with God.  Everything syncs to all my devices so I only have to highlight and make notes once.
A13RINJH57HENT B008XG1X18 3 1349654400 45 I really, really love Pinterest and I love that the app is free, but it force closes on my Kindle a lot and it is really slow at times. If those problems were fixed then it would definentally be worthy of a five star rating.
A13RINJH57HENT B00846GMHW 3 1340582400 34 This is great if you want to waste time. It is a fun game to play against you friends. Fyi, the ads are annoying and to remove them you have to pay for it.
A13RINJH57HENT B006OC2ANS 5 1331856000 33 I've owned this game for almost a week and so far I've played it everyday. I love it! It has great graphics and the sound effects are cool. I highly recommend it! :)
A13RINJH57HENT B004SCEUXE 2 1325894400 40 I've owned this game for less than 5 minutes and I'm already bored out of my mind. It would be a lot more fun if it changed colors or something. The only entertaining thing about this is the sound effects.
A13RINJH57HENT B007SYWFRM 3 1337904000 42 This is one of my favorite games! The only bad thing is that it freezes my Kindle a lot and my Kindle has to die before I can do anything. If the game didn't freeze I would have given it 5 stars.
A13RNGFMP1ZK88 B00FMRWEAA 5 1393632000 35 I have no words at all. Except this game is flipping awesome. It's my favorite out if them all because of the fashion contest. I may be to young for this game it's still awesome.
A13RNGFMP1ZK88 B00IZLM8MY 5 1402790400 21 This app is very fun. In some ways, it's kind of like the Sims free play. You should get it. :-)
A13RNGFMP1ZK88 B009C7ZQM4 5 1393286400 20 This literally saved my kindle. If it hadn't advised me. Sheww I would've been in a whole lot of trouble.
A13RNGFMP1ZK88 B007ZE34FM 4 1393027200 38 I love how you can listen to music and play stuff but... sometimes it says error file not found. And sometimes it won't play the music that you download but... it's pretty good and that only happens sometimes.
A13RNGFMP1ZK88 B00DJFIMW6 5 1392681600 21 This game is so awesome! I haven't seen the second movie but this game shows me how it's most likely looks!
A13RWFN2U9R1S6 B0063IH60K 5 1359244800 20 I like to play solitaire and use it when on a car trip.  It helps to pass time while driving.
A13RWFN2U9R1S6 B004SUWR2C 4 1359244800 31 This is fun because it can be played by one person.  It is a good time filler while on a road trip or sitting in a doctor office.I recommend this game.
A13S3A31YDROSQ B009PSV1HE 3 1354406400 26 Not sure of this game quests not always clear and not enough explanation on how to achieve these goals.Not sure if I would recommend this game
A13S3A31YDROSQ B00HHBXYGM 5 1399075200 29 I found this game while searching for a new match 3 game and was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it....it's fun and challenging!!!! Give it a try
A13S3A31YDROSQ B0073LHCCS 5 1401408000 23 Just started playing today and I'm already hooked. Try it yourself and see what I mean.Works those brain cells after a few levels.
A13S3A31YDROSQ B00GP0G0IK 4 1387238400 20 Great if you like puzzles...I enjoy Hidden object games...and a few of the mini games in Azada are brain racking
A13S69NC95PPFM B0097GVJWQ 5 1373846400 22 AWESOME, AWESOME game. Very anxious for a second one. Game like this are hard to find. Let alone to have a squeal.
A13S69NC95PPFM B00CWGWAEE 5 1373673600 23 All around great game. Would love to see a squeal and play. I love games that are not to hard but not easy.
A13S72H465L2J6 B004YL208Q 2 1338768000 37 yeah well this was an impulse buy. it shows huh? pretty pointless unless your fav pastime is staring deep into really aritificial candle flames. literally nuthin 2 do xept touch the candle on/off.pretty stupid. dont get. ever.
A13S72H465L2J6 B007U8JRWW 4 1344470400 31 really awesome idea but the app could b better. kinda jumpy and unfocused. also I can never find the ones I like best; they seem to switch around. buy this app.
A13S91F68EPJEE B0067R0APK 1 1365120000 43 I liked the simple version and hate this one. It is difficult to read and a pain to sift through for some quick information.  How do I get the simple one back. I won't be so quick to upgrade in the future.P. Simpson
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B0058VW36U 5 1336435200 28 My Husbands friend told him about this game,  I was skeptically about at first.. from hear say...  ha ha.  Having fun playing it... Shhhh.. Don't tell..  ha ha
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B004SBQGHS 5 1336435200 34 What else can you say about ANGRY BIRDS ... What a great way to spend some extra time.. Great way to relax. My child likes it too.. Not just for kids...  ha ha ha
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B004WGGQPQ 5 1336435200 28 Thank u. Amazon.Exactly what I was looking for,  A simple Drawing Pad that has all the tools my son likes to draw with. Hassle free. I love it.
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B007ZRZF8I 5 1336435200 21 Lmao!  This game is great, Glad I got it. Lots of fun and challenging..  Run Gravity Guy!  Run!  ha ha ha
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B004GVV4T0 5 1341792000 19 Fun, Challenging game.. Love to play puzzles like this. Thanks AmazonWorks great on my Kindle Fire.. And it's free..
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B006QCMPWM 5 1336435200 23 I love fish,  So this game gives me the best of both worlds,  Playing a game and watching fish.. Oh Yeah. And Relaxation.
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B005T87QCI 5 1336435200 27 Too Cool.  I enjoyed the movie and the game is neat. My son loves to be able to play the game on my KINDLE.  Thank u. AMAZON
A13SB7XQSSM8OD B009LFGG76 4 1402358400 51 I LOVE THE GAME,  GOOO EASY FUN,  GREAT WAY TO PASS TIME AND CHALLENGE YOURSELF IN FINDING THE WORDS.. WHAT I HATE ABOUT IT IS THE TIMER,  I DONT WANT TO BE TIMED EVERYTIME I PLAY AND THERES NO OPTION TO TURN IT OFF... UGG..  BUT HEY ITS FREE FUN...  ENJOY....
A13SC4R3K4C8P2 B004RCUJ9E 4 1333584000 20 I love this game because you can play as a single player or against another person. Great time killer app.
A13SC4R3K4C8P2 B004HX4RT6 4 1356480000 56 I got this for my son to learn to play chess. This is a really nice game that allows them to learn the moves and coordinates and as they get better the levels get more difficult. I also like the time killing ability that doesn't make me feel like I am completely non-productive while I play.
A13SC4R3K4C8P2 B00CXVX1OQ 4 1377734400 25 Very entertaining game. The wifi link up doesn't seem to work with older phones, but that is alright for now. Otherwise my kids love it.
A13SE5S3XXORXT B006IY163C 1 1324771200 31 For the money you only get two of the actual games.  The other 7 cost 99 cents each.  Not worth the money.  This does NOT do the Atari brand name proud.
A13SE5S3XXORXT B006QZM73Q 1 1326758400 48 This has gotta be one of the worst applications that I've ever gotten for free on the amazon market.  There is no entertainment value to this.  Well maybe there's some entertainment value if say you're somebody who is completely obsessed with eating cookies.  Other than that don't bother.
A13SEEZ4VTUQTH B008AMNF3Y 4 1340928000 22 took a while to figure out how to get to locked levels. nice challenge without being frustrated and it is free today.
A13SEEZ4VTUQTH B005J80RTW 4 1329523200 36 Fast-moving, fun, and a great way to challenge your brain without a long time commitment. Not sure how some of the top scorers can swipe fast enough to get over 60 words in 2 1/2 minutes!
A13SEEZ4VTUQTH B004MC8CA2 5 1348531200 74 this is the only Bible app I've tried, but it works really well for my needs. Lots of reading plans to choose from as well as many versions. I enjoy the ease of switching between versions for comparison study and some of the different languages available.I would really like a search by Strong 's number but so far haven't seen that as an option. It may be possible but I don't think so.Great app.
A13SHHYY8GGGGJ B00ADPH2YO 4 1357084800 20 First time with my new kindle fire playing slots-this is a good game for relaxing-i do really enjoy playing slots
A13SHHYY8GGGGJ B00D2XD5JU 4 1379548800 37 Enjoyed but do not like games like this one where you have to stop for awhile if you don't advance in so many tries.  Not a fan of timed levels-makes the game too tense instead of relaxing.
A13SHHYY8GGGGJ B00CJ77HU8 5 1379548800 20 Has enough challenging levels to keep your interest.  You can keep going if you want to &#34;best&#34; yourself score wise.
A13SHHYY8GGGGJ B00HEFEDAM 4 1392422400 20 The only complaint is the items are a little small to see so your eyes get tired quicker.  Very entertaining.
A13SHHYY8GGGGJ B00GY0HJ4K 5 1392422400 23 Similar in ways to other games out there but still unique.  I like that you have the choice of staying off of Facebook.
A13SL589AD2GTV B004GJDQT8 3 1349654400 29 Its not nearly as useful as the website, but it will get you by on a mobile platform. Its difficult to view the different tabs for the daily deals.
A13SL589AD2GTV B004XDYJRU 5 1401062400 38 One of my all time favorites across both platforms. Although the new version isn't as flat as the earlier versions. Too many taps to get to playing the latest station. Love that I can record shows for later!
A13SL589AD2GTV B004SJ3AXI 5 1321315200 21 what can I say its more of the same great game. I just hope they still continue to update this app.
A13SL589AD2GTV B005F9Z2G8 1 1312934400 22 why would a pay app still have ads? who thought of this genius idea? oh well, its only the new York post.
A13SL589AD2GTV B004T5RDBG 1 1306972800 20 there is A separate list on the web somewhere that list a lot if these programs as not being good.
A13SL589AD2GTV B00696GNC8 2 1324598400 22 I had to get it! but disappointment came when I tried to open it. It won't open to start! It just crashes!!
A13SL589AD2GTV B004UNGZ8Y 1 1313280000 30 why do programmers keep making these memory boosters? they don&apos;t work. if someone wants to help me , write a program that let&apos;s me remove the bloatware on my phone.
A13SNL4SXIWTKI B008RA3X5E 5 1400025600 31 I'm very happy with this alarm app. It does just what I need. It works very well and is simple to use. You won't be disappointed. Try it, you'll like it.
A13SNL4SXIWTKI B0093QQCGI 5 1357689600 22 Lots of news with lots of categories. This app covers a lot of different stories and subjects. I really enjoy using it.
A13SNL4SXIWTKI B004OG7XY2 5 1355961600 30 Well done application. Every level of chess player will enjoy this app, it works perfectly. The various options and functions have been well thought out. It is a fun app!
A13SPNL2189QLK B00702PZME 5 1402012800 32 This is the best app ever. I realize I know more than I thought. It's so much fun, I can go through this app solo fast. I give this app 5 stars.
A13SPNL2189QLK B00JTKDTLE 5 1401840000 44 I love this game. I can get so lost in it.  The time just flat by when playing. It can really get addicting. I have tried other games that are the same but I liked this one the best.I  give this one 5 stars.
A13SPNL2189QLK B007ZGO7EM 5 1404172800 22 I use this calculator whenever I need too. It's my favorite one to use. Fast and speedy.I give it a five stars.
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00HG3VFYO 5 1388620800 32 Great graphics. This game is for all ages. I'm having a lot of fun playing this game. Mysterious mission to save your friends in time before the evil Visgrow  family gets you.
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00B2V66VS 5 1359244800 21 Temple run 2 is different because of the different scenery's and not more forest. Spikes and other new obstacles are cool!!!
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00DD1F0VC 5 1379376000 20 This game may be tough, but it's awesome. The plot is very reasonable to understand. Beautiful graphics! Creepy robots everywhere.
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00B116U0G 5 1360800000 23 this game is awesome and cute to play because of the concept of blowing up sheep. How many sheep can u blow up?
A13SVJQZFHS237 B0097GVJWQ 5 1378425600 26 Solving the mystery of the missing girls and a detective was not easy but the tools I collected were useful. Eye popping graphics and tough puzzles.
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00CFNDUIY 5 1386460800 21 The characters look funny. Awesome quests to complete. Love it a lot.No problem with waiting for certain buildings to be built.
A13SVJQZFHS237 B008IJTFYW 5 1355011200 30 the sounds for sleeping is helpful for me to sleep when I have rough nights. Nothing else can seem to help me but with Relax Melodies my night gets better
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00BSW0M34 5 1364774400 21 building traps and homes for animals are fun! Funny sound effects from the croods family and creatures. The graphics are beatiful!
A13SVJQZFHS237 B00D3MWW44 5 1373500800 27 The graphics are cute. Some levels are hard but I managed. Awesome game!!! Playing during summer is very fun. Dolphins are adorable. No more boredom for me.
A13SVJQZFHS237 B0067QCC70 5 1377129600 23 The puzzles in each level get harder as I go. Graphics are beautiful.The Mystery of the Crystal portal is fun for all ages!
A13SVJQZFHS237 B008IJT0CE 5 1370822400 21 These sounds on this app are really beatiful and soothing to my ears.  I never have nightmares again,after using this app.
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B00BYJ6BUO 4 1372291200 36 It gets right to the show and the picture is clear, the streaming is perfect, but, too many commercials. Then, if you try to fast forward during the show, it goes to commercials before it FFs.
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B0093BM38O 4 1381449600 26 it's decent, but I am not entirely impressed, and I am a chronic Jeopardy fan. I suppose I might enjoy watching it more than playing it.
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B009WJNXAE 3 1396569600 35 I suppose the game is okay, but there is not much of an appeal to play. There is too much going on in that one game. For that reason, I need to delete my download.
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B004LZF2LW 4 1393372800 36 I'm not sure how very functional this app is for me, but, I love the look and the colors. Besides, it is a pretty nifty idea to know what time it is all over the world.
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B0063IH60K 5 1360195200 25 Great way to pass time or wind down before bed.  I normally play solitaire most nights just before I fall asleep. This game works perfectly!
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B00AGOGOLE 4 1361145600 72 It does what it needs to do, but, you really don't need this App unless you plan to do videos, because there is already a camera on your Kindle in the Photos tab. I got it b/c my Kindle cam disappeared on me one night and I couldn't Skype. I thought I needed to by the camera, turns out, I needed to do a hard restart. Holy smokes! I wasted 2 bucks!!!
A13SZZKV5LVFH1 B008JGSM6G 5 1362614400 33 Excellent mind challenge! Just when you think you've got the colors connected right, look and think carefully because you may not. I love any game that requires critical thinking and strategy. Great game!
A13T5J98N0ESXC B008TQ16OG 5 1398902400 22 It gives you something to strive for. Whether it is a new bike or just beat your old time. It is addicting
A13T5J98N0ESXC B00CQ9U1PW 5 1376524800 38 This is hilarious haha the weapons and ways u can beat him down are awesome! Great way to pass the time for those of u who r 1) bored 2) in a hurtful mude and 3)like torture games
A13T5J98N0ESXC B0090P98Z4 5 1371686400 23 Good game if you are into Diablo champions of norath or boulders gate. I suggest buying for those who want a fun game.
A13TG02ZE28WMK B006D1ONE4 5 1327017600 30 it is definitely worth the money! I recommend this app for everyone! the graphics and physics are beautiful. I played for hours as soon as I downloaded it...does not disappoint!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B006PHD0RW 5 1327276800 39 I love love LOVE it! its such a challenging game that will keep you entertained for hours! I normally wouldn't pay $1.99 for an app, but this was completely worth it! it runs beautifully on my Kindle Fire :)
A13TG02ZE28WMK B007AJU2MK 4 1332633600 33 a nice little game that progressively becomes more challenging the longer you play. would like to see some.different settings or cars added to it though. the free aspect of it is great though!!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B004HM35RC 5 1332633600 51 this game will definitely take control of your Kindle Fire's large screen and leave you feeling like you are a flying ninja! the game has a simple, but yet challenging flying aspect to it that isn't common in most vertical style games. I'm surprised it is free because it is awesome!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B0064XT03U 5 1332028800 53 I absolutely love this game! the graphics on my kindle fire look fantastic! I played this game for hours within in the first few days of having it. its not just a boy game, either. I'm a girl and am in love with it. I'm honestly surprised they don't charge more for it!!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B004SUWR2C 5 1327276800 35 I have no idea why people are leaving bad reviews, I love it! It runs great and I've had no problems with it on my Kindle Fire. The graphics look wonderful on the larger screen!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B007MNV5WU 5 1332633600 85 I was hesitate that I was going to get a similar gaming aspect of the other Angry Birds but with a starry background. I was definitely wrong! it is nothing like the other versions, from the gaming system, to the music, it all is a wonderful change. you just have to try it to experience the new, challenging goals of this game. do not hesitate at all to purchase this app! It looks fantastic on my kindle fire..it will definitely please those Angry Birds fanatics!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B007DKC922 5 1332633600 21 awesome app, especially on the marge kindle screen. it is great for all ages and is challenging. definitely worth downloading :)
A13TG02ZE28WMK B0067VKQLE 5 1332633600 32 I loved my game on my iphone and its wonderful that I now can enjoy it on a larger screen on my kindle fire. its absolutely addicting! the 2.99 is worth it!
A13TG02ZE28WMK B0062OFUNU 5 1332979200 24 lets you know all ttbw nutritional facts in an organized way. very easy to use especially when you are mobile. love that its free!
A13TGDPL9MELM3 B0058KGXXU 1 1363564800 22 I would put no stars butit won't let meDO NOT GET THIS APP it does not even explain. how to play it
A13TGDPL9MELM3 B008J1ZVRY 5 1360454400 29 at first I thought it would be stupid butt I was appsulotly RONG so much fun and can not stop playing it plus great for being on a airplane
A13TGDPL9MELM3 B007L3M1W4 4 1363478400 24 this app is great I have a fores close problem Burt other wise it is the best app you half to get this app
A13TJB6KZ2JGMZ B00E5GJ7QS 4 1400284800 27 I am always looking for new BINGO games, and this one is better than most...although I think it goes a little too slow with the number calling.
A13TJB6KZ2JGMZ B0073LWEXK 3 1354320000 65 I like some others felt this game required me to use hints more than I wanted...I basically took notes from the hints and used them as directions...beat the game already! :( Expected there to be more...If the game would have been like some of the others of the same nature, I might have given it a better review. Never had an issue on my Fire...
A13TOVPDJ4RSK B00EYIG5US 3 1380240000 92 This game was not at all what i was expecting. they do not give you any hints unless you buy coins so that is a rip off. no wonder it's free there's always a catch. some of the people are easy but you get some that I have never seen and then when you want a hint they send you to a place where they want you to buy coins. if I wanted to pay money I would have bought a game that wasn't free. don't wast your time on this one.
A13TOVPDJ4RSK B006C4U9RW 1 1384300800 23 don't bother it did not work at all for me so I don't know why i wasted my time or money on this
A13TOZIE5U2QGF B00CWY76CC 4 1371945600 23 Challenging enough to be interesting but not so hard as to be frustrating.  It reminds me of 100 Doors but much more logical.
A13TOZIE5U2QGF B00HEFEDAM 2 1388880000 75 I would gladly pay $3 to $5 for open play but I'm not paying $2 every thirty or forty levels.  Other reviews indicate you can open levels in a similar way as Candy Crush and I might check back to try to open more.  I don't annoy my FB friends with my games so that isn't an option.  I also don't buy power ups but it doesn't bother me that these games offer those options.
A13TOZIE5U2QGF B00H51RUZK 4 1404950400 7 Nothing fancy but a good, basic tool.
A13TUDSG4QK0P0 B008GU42KK 5 1392854400 21 Love PlayrixCool graphics, fun game.Thanks Amazon and Playrix.Like relaxing and interesting games with really fun graphics.Please create more fun games Playrix.
A13TUDSG4QK0P0 B00FN7K8Z2 5 1394236800 29 Love the graphics, love the hints.  Hope they create a lot more games like this one because I could actually play the entire game.  Thanks for a great game.
A13TUDSG4QK0P0 B00E0NVX4U 5 1395187200 24 Fun relaxing, no pressure, nice graphics, don't have to buy anything but the game.  I could live without finding the differences, otherwise fun game.
A13TUDSG4QK0P0 B007SYWFRM 2 1390176000 42 The graphics are wonderful but one must spend money to go very far with it; bought some acorns but can't find them anywhere!  Would be nice if one could simply spend $5 for the game and get the extras from points earned.
A13TUDSG4QK0P0 B00964BWFS 4 1384560000 20 Fun, entertaining and not difficult.  Endless, you can keep on playing...Great when you just want to relax.  Worth the money.
A13TUDSG4QK0P0 B0097EWK3A 5 1402617600 34 Gr8 game!  When is the next one - I can hardly wait!!  Length of game really good, hints are good, not too complicated especially since you can skip the puzzles.  Totally worth $ 2.99
A13TVLTENPTHWP B004LOMB2Q 4 1334534400 86 Evernote is a very handy app to have. I use it in so many different areas of my life: Recording homework assignments; taking snapshots on the board with my phone to review and make notes on the Kindle Fire later (using Skitch) and exercise routines so I can quickly glance at them in the gym.The mobile UI is fine, though I wouldn't object to an upgrade to make it easier to use.It's never let me down in terms of functuality, and I would definitely recommend it.
A13TVLTENPTHWP B004N2NWT2 4 1327190400 32 I've played sections 1 and 2 of this without a hitch. All the rotations required work fine. Maybe there was an update, but I recommend the Fire owners to try it again.
A13TVLTENPTHWP B005TBWN0K 4 1334534400 56 It could use a few improvements, including a wider colour range. For me the biggest downfall is the inability to erase instead of undoing. Sometimes I wish to erase something without undoing everything else.Apart from that it's great for a free app and useful in class for editing a snapshot of notes on the board. :)
A13TVLTENPTHWP B0066T8SDU 1 1336003200 59 I haven't been able to play with other people for the past few weeks because my current games isn't updating. I can only use the single player option, and this works fine, but I like the human factor of online playing. The current situation is frustrating considering this is a paid app. Until they fix the glitches, one star.
A13TVLTENPTHWP B006D1ONE4 5 1330560000 33 It's a great game for all ages. It has elements that appeal to everyone and the gameplay is excellent. I've had no problems with it on my Kindle Fire. Also love the update.
A13TVLTENPTHWP B004N371CK 4 1328227200 40 I played multiplayer and a few single player modes. It played very smoothly And I had no problems whatsoever. Fun game if you're into papertoss genre. The physics seem on key enough, and it's very fun to pass and play.
A13TVLTENPTHWP B004O3YGMC 5 1328745600 100 With this app, I can lie in bed and still enjoy the full functionality of my laptop. It streams seamlessly. The only change made to my computer is the changing of the colour scheme. The different control methods are handy for different situations, and I use them both. It connects immediately and I've never had a situation with the connection dropping. I believe the connection is unencrytped though, so you shouldn't use credit card info or such like over untrusted networks when using this. This is a minor though, and doesn't affect the effectiveness of this app. Very useful overall.
A13TVLTENPTHWP B0063GORYU 5 1325203200 29 This game is great. It's very seamless and entertaining. So far I haven't encountered any glitches while playing. If this were a paid app, I'd buy it. Great job.
A13TW48VJJ82QK B00FS0VUWO 2 1389052800 22 It's alright but there's nothing to do in-flight only part that is challenging is landing and even that's not all that hard
A13TW48VJJ82QK B00G5LQ5MU 4 1388361600 33 The only issue I have with this game is that you have to buy hints. Otherwise it's a great game so far. I'm only on about level 5 but I really enjoy it.
A13TYUPOI9XEJ3 B004MC8CA2 5 1361404800 21 I use my Bible app every day!! I take it to Church with me every Sunday!! I Highly Recommend This APP!!
A13TYUPOI9XEJ3 B004SJ3BCI 5 1362268800 21 Great App!! I Love The Angry Birds!!  I Highly Recommend This App!! It is Great Fun and Highly Entertaining!! Love It!!
A13TYUPOI9XEJ3 B00BT1SL50 5 1367193600 21 This is a great game! I highgly recommend it for anyone that wants a challenge!!  Great Graphics!! Great Fun & Exciting!!
A13U4AM6UECSS0 B008R5RGAC 5 1394928000 32 After installing Norton lite I've had zero problems with it. Runs as expected. Been using Norton for years and I am happy with the program running on my kindle. Works just fine.
A13U4AM6UECSS0 B004JZBGWI 5 1370908800 40 Fast and smooth. Keeps track of just about anything that I need while traveling with my kindle fire hd.  Able to keep short and precise lists, or make longer notes on detailed subjects that I do not want to forget.
A13U4AM6UECSS0 B0066W1AZK 2 1365206400 40 Started out good.  Now freezes up my kindle fire hd.  Also, at times it played well and then would make beginning move mistakes while set high on the level bar.  Deleted from my kindles.  Hope to find another chess software.
A13U4GZJ70A54Q B00ATU5JRA 1 1360454400 22 I downloaded the most to thing but it didn't instal how do I  instal it.I'm checking this thing for help every day
A13U4GZJ70A54Q B00992CF6W 5 1358899200 36 I would highly recommend free working mods for this game or a free texture pack other then default.  Also I recommend this to all gamers, no Matter who u r.  please take my ideas into consideraction.
A13U5BFN3ZB6CX B00DUVQIIY 1 1379980800 24 This game is not for anyone who has any problem seeing.  The blue backgrounds make it too difficult to see any kind of object.
A13U5BFN3ZB6CX B00DQ8APIK 3 1379980800 20 Game is okay.  Not very challenging for those who enjoy trying to guess logos.  Can be fun for certain ages.
A13U5BFN3ZB6CX B00EZWPFW2 3 1379980800 21 Requires too many coins for a hint.  Not a good game for younger players.  Okay for players who do enjoy riddles.
A13U6K7QNRP36L B008I43DYU 5 1396396800 30 Calculator Pro is very handy and includes the option to change the sizes and look of the calculator. Extremely useful when you  are doing simple calculations or actual accounting situations.
A13U6K7QNRP36L B00E83G68K 4 1394409600 41 This game requires you to manipulate the limited space given to arrange all the players. I have not reached any challenges yet in the game. The characters are just as I remembered them from the &#34;Muppet Show&#34; featuring Jim Henson's creations.
A13U72LNF0WL2Y B005V1N71W 3 1329955200 31 I love this app,but I never get to listen to the band I want to,it always just plays other bands with the same kind of music. besides that it is great
A13U72LNF0WL2Y B004UID2LC 1 1329868800 24 I like the app but this isn't right it is illegal to download music off youtube. that's why I give it only 1 star.
A13U72LNF0WL2Y B0064T6LV8 5 1329955200 31 this is a great game for my kindle fire. I also have it for my andriod smart phone and the screen is to small to play it just moves to much.
A13U72LNF0WL2Y B004GYY714 5 1329955200 25 I love this app u can listen to anything that has ever been on the radio along with the regular stations all over the globe
A13UAVT45110ZB B0066T8M1I 5 1325289600 70 This game is amazing on the Kindle Fire.  The color and 3D imagery is beautiful.  The game is challenging and has AI so you can play against the computer.  Lasts forever but the Kindle always holds your place so when you open it up again, there it is where you last played.  Just choose resume game from the menu.  The music is pleasing also.  I am glad I bought it.
A13UAVT45110ZB B005TBWN0K 5 1324944000 30 Fun to doodle with this app on the Kindle Fire!  It does what it is supposed to.  Thanks Amazon for the fun apps.  I lose myself in my Kindle Fire!
A13UAVT45110ZB B004JK61K0 5 1325462400 80 this app does what it should and is easy to understand.  best of all it is free. thanks k-9 dog walkers.I don't know what happened, but the app didn't work one day.  The good thing is that I can get gmail on my Kindle fire HD.  All I have to do is go to the web like with any computer, and check my gmail.  Of course, I need wifi for the 7" Kindle HD.  Anyhow.  This app is already date.
A13UAVT45110ZB B0067QCC70 4 1325376000 56 I downloaded this to Kindle fire and it starts with pretty graphics.  I didn't really get how to play it and ran out of patience.  I deleted it.  It takes more space than the usual apps and took a while to download.  I am giving it a 4 because it wasn't really my kind of game.
A13UAVT45110ZB B005V1N71W 5 1325203200 63 I got Pandora up and running on my Kindle Fire.  I got alarmed by a message that said charges may apply, so I came back to my computer and checked out Pandora.com.  I love this better than anything I have had in years for music online.  It is great!  I hope the Kindle Fire app works out as well.  I wouldn't delete it!
A13UAVT45110ZB B004GVYXTS 5 1325289600 32 The only reason I am giving reviews is that it is free.  I feel I owe it to the developers.  This game is fun and challenging.  Looks pretty on the Kindle Fire.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004J1DBJI 5 1325289600 89 I really like this app but wanted it for work.  I am a chemist working for an Access Control company and thought it would be nice to use the math functions.  The only problem is that I do not get WiFi at work and this app must have WiFi to do anything.  That is the reason it gets only 4 stars.  All other times this app is a good thing to have.I found the web site for this and can get that at work.  Thank you to other reviewers!
A13UAVT45110ZB B006HJKKCG 5 1325203200 26 I like this app but it has to connect to WiFi to translate.  It was free and has over 50 languages.  Works well on Kindle Fire.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004UID2LC 1 1357948800 36 Is it me?  I love youtube but don't like this app.  I don't find what I am looking for on this app.  I can't stop finding what I want on youtube on my computer. please help.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004EBZX6W 5 1325289600 46 This is a handy little app for the Kindle.  I was out buying coffee and could park in the vicinity of several restaurants to see where the best WiFi is.  Then that's where I go to get my coffee.  By the way, Wendys won over McDonalds.
A13UAVT45110ZB B0050KDTSK 5 1377216000 22 It didn't update on my kindle but it does work now.  So happy.  I adore farmstory and amazon!  can't wait till halloween.
A13UAVT45110ZB B006HVARCC 5 1325376000 81 Another cute draw program that works on Kindle Fire. The color is beautiful. The app is fun and easy to use. I like this very much.Update!  Wow!  For people who like to draw, this is the best with Kindle HD!  The higher resolution and the difference in how you pan makes this app work way better than the kindle fire.  Highly recommend the newer HD Kindle for this app.  It is still very experimental but isn't that what makes it art?
A13UAVT45110ZB B009HKL4B8 4 1359158400 52 I like to use the Sims program to build things like my own museums...This thing launched right into making your Sim and silly things like pat the dog.  I like Sims on my computer more but this is good if you only like the people in Sims. Works great on Kindle HD.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004SZHD3K 5 1325289600 27 This game is a really fun time killer.  The graphics are pretty on the Kindle Fire.  I am giving it 5 stars because it is free too!
A13UAVT45110ZB B00514DIE0 5 1324944000 46 I love it on my new Kindle Fire!  I played this game for years and it is still great on the Kindle Fire too.  It is pretty and colorful.  I lose myself in the Kindle Fire and the apps.  This is free too!  Amazon is Great!!!!
A13UAVT45110ZB B004LOMB2Q 4 1325376000 40 I tried to use this and kept getting an invalid password error message.  Not what I wanted, because it is too much trouble.  I am giving it 4 stars because it may just be my impatience to deal with it.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004GMJKTK 5 1325289600 24 Challenging and fun.  I like this game on Kindle Fire.  I also like that it has AI and I can play against a computer.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004SCR8QU 5 1325203200 33 This really works well on my Kindle Fire.  I bought Bluecell pens to draw with it and it feels great.  I have really enjoyed it so much, I upgraded for only 99 cents.
A13UAVT45110ZB B005UQ9FNC 4 1329177600 139 this game was so cute.  it was free.  takes forever to earn those Chili peppers but finally enough for a rainbow.  now the rainbow is missing and the only way to get another one is buy it. is that really free?  it is annoying.  PO'd big time.  the pictures is the only good thing about this and there is no customer support for free.Not only is Valentine's Day almost over but no special Valentine prizes either!  I am appalled by this crashing app.  If there is a Valentine collection, I can't open the app.  I cleaned so much bird poo for nothing!  I am going to toss all my cages if I get back in that app ever again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I still love this even though it has its flaws.  I still think the bongo should play when you tap it.
A13UAVT45110ZB B005RXEXP8 1 1325289600 41 I could not open this.  An error message said that it was not compatible with my Kindle Fire.  I was disappointed because I deleted it and read other reviews, saying there are ways to open it.  I hope this gets fixed.
A13UAVT45110ZB B006RMJ1I2 5 1348358400 26 Works well on kindle fire with blue cell pen from Q1C1(cheap ones).  Better than any handwriting software I have ever used.  Extremely impressive! Thanks so much.
A13UAVT45110ZB B0066T8SDU 5 1324944000 53 I read that the Kindle Fire version of Scrabble has a single player option.  I tried it and it was great!  Love Scrabble!  Did not have any problems on the Kindle Fire.  FUN!!!!!!!!!Update:Played this game 76 times and never lost.  Got suspicious.  Noticed the computer let me win????  Still a good word exercise.
A13UAVT45110ZB B004S8L4MI 5 1325289600 24 Really nice graphics.  Much better than any of the old pool games I ever played on a computer.  Get this for your Kindle Fire!
A13UAVT45110ZB B004LUS390 1 1329091200 26 I can only find thumbnails of my drawings with horrible resolution after spending a long time sketching.  Really disappointed.This app never worked on my kindle fire.
A13UB45EYJ048W B004HGK6FW 5 1356825600 40 This is the best Sudoku I have so far.  You can go through the entire puzzle marking each square to make it easier to solve the puzzle.  It has levels from easy to extreme.  I absolutely enjoy playing this game.
A13UB45EYJ048W B005HB4F08 3 1356825600 45 I love these kinds of tests.  I have gotten as far as I can get.  There is one test where I just can't get it and  you have to start over again when you do not accomplish that particular test.  It is frustrating at times.
A13UB45EYJ048W B004KU2JZU 5 1356825600 53 I love playing solitaire and this pack has a wide variety of games.  I have 2 favorites that I play all the time which is Picture Gallery and Trefoil.  Picture Gallery is very difficult and I don't win very much but it helps my thinking power. I play this for hours on end.
A13UB45EYJ048W B0063GSL60 5 1356825600 36 I absolutely love FreeCell and it is a very fun game.  I have it on my computer at  home and take it with me on my Kindle Fire when I go places to keep me busy.
A13UD7KO9E8O0L B008LG021M 5 1401667200 23 Yay for cybertron the language in transformers r and chin gala dinner and regards the fish in a gem of clans hack tool
A13UD7KO9E8O0L B009GMD1NQ 5 1368403200 22 It is the best game ever invented in the world. Killing all of the people is cool with all of those guns.
A13UD7KO9E8O0L B00F7YHDWC 5 1381363200 54 See as the d be friends and a great deal with it and a few years back to go to the d and I got up to go poopoo and a great way for the d be a great deal of the d and a few days later in m and I think that
A13UDMAUNLGTRT B00G5LQ5MU 1 1384560000 24 pretty good game...i did need hints...hope this will help...i love hidden object games...they keep me busy...need to keep my memory on in good condition
A13UDMAUNLGTRT B00AA87JGU 2 1369612800 23 so far so good...kind of easy but I'm sure it will get more difficult...at least i hope so...if not...at least it was free.
A13UGTMT825UYG B0058VW36U 1 1321488000 20 Sucks to be me. Won't download on the Kindle Fuego. I don't have problems with any other app. on here.
A13UGTMT825UYG B00AECDDYY 5 1402444800 42 Very fun and addictive strategy game. Very challenging, if you want it to be, yet simple. Good time killer on your tablet! I almost feel like not beating it just so I can have something fun to play on my next flight.
A13UGTMT825UYG B006C4U9RW 5 1324857600 94 **Bugs fixed and I love this app much better than Pandora. Upgraded rating to 5 stars!**This is a great app. I love the music selection and the playlists, interface, etc. The only problem is that it kept force closing when I tried to navigate the app. Over and over 100% of the time. I had to uninstall. I'm disappointed that an app that has "(Kindle Fire Version)" in the title would force close on the KF so often. I'll check it again in a month or two to see if they patched the issue.
A13UGTMT825UYG B007MNV5WU 1 1334275200 22 Same old Bird tossing and only 2 levels for $2.99!?? Very lame, redundant and disappointing.  buy something else if you like money
A13UGTMT825UYG B005AJ6ISO 1 1336953600 29 The words are actually from men and NOT Jesus like the app claims. Hopefully, an update is released that will allow Jesus to send words down to his followers.
A13UGTMT825UYG B008MEM24S 5 1388016000 59 Playing this game, at least it was when I bought it. Seeing it as the FAOTD spurred me to write a review. I REALLY enjoyed this game. It's fun, yet challenging at times. Very well balanced game that I highly recommend! Also, if you enjoy this as much as I did, get Where's My Water and Where's My Mickey.
A13UGTMT825UYG B0055SWM08 5 1322179200 33 Quell is a beautiful game that challenges you with puzzles in such a serene way, that you actually feel more relaxed as you play. I love it and recommend it for casual puzzlers.
A13UGTMT825UYG B0069G5Z9K 5 1386374400 41 There's some crazy column that takes up a half inch of the right part of the screen as you play.Update: I rebooted my kindle and the issue resolved itself. It hasn't returned since, restoring this game back in its full glory!!!
A13UGTMT825UYG B006HUWEHY 3 1325376000 31 This game runs great and is a ton of fun, but its just too hard. The sliiiightest timing error and you're done. Still fun though, so worth checking out. (Kindle Fire)
A13UGTMT825UYG B004S33RRI 4 1303171200 55 I've been using this app now for a few months and I really like it. The major problem I have is the long load time every entry and change to an entry takes. Otherwise, I really like it and use it every time I shop. If I find a better app, I'll update this review.
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00BX42FLY 5 1397520000 22 This game makes you think more about each picture and its really fun. It great for people who just love a challenge.
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00KI5Q8X0 3 1404259200 34 Wolf among us is amazing and gives you choices but you can't see the characters when you're fighting or talking to other characters. It's all the same as the computer version except the glitch.
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00HRMNKWE 5 1398988800 20 This game is amazing and you have to think more about what they're asking. Love it love it love it
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00E4PSG7G 5 1380326400 26 It is a really good game recommend getting it the game is something different and it a good game that is all i have to say
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392508800 20 This  game is like flappy bird and I hate/love this game it's hard but addictive omg so fun and addictive
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00H25P2JA 5 1389398400 23 This game gives you a variety of weapons including guns to kill the boss again and again and you get coins for it
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00IZJLRQE 5 1405382400 26 This game is like flappy bird but it gives you more of a challenge when you get the evil nyan (which is a waffle) #happy sounds
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00DJFIMW6 5 1390694400 34 In other games they only have 1 place to run in this game you have more than that and you also have a secret area which gives you a lot of bandanas #fun game
A13UHAKJ3MXKQF B00A8ECU24 5 1402099200 26 This game helps you build your own world and the best part you have pink gems. This game has ponyville canterlot and the equestria girls world
A13UHPTN4VTO3K B004Z9Y3VY 5 1326931200 48 watch tophatvideos on youtube and you will get 500x the amusement of this game...this game is amusing and makes u laugh...although it has no end it is fun. but wen it talks about the white button don't waste ur time looking 4 it because u wont find it.
A13UIEWVG5PCH1 B0055SWM08 5 1326153600 29 great game for relaxing before bed, I could become addicted very easily. I love playing this game,  I don't know how hard its gonna get, I hope it doesn't!
A13UIEWVG5PCH1 B006D1ONE4 5 1329782400 28 I never cared for Angry Birds, Cut the Rope and such.... but Swampy is a different story!  I adore this game and reset to play over and over!!
A13UIEWVG5PCH1 B0080JD59G 5 1337731200 29 I was surprised at how much I liked this game.  2 thumbs up!  You never know with these games but this is one of the best in my opinion!!
A13UIEWVG5PCH1 B0073LWEXK 5 1336521600 67 This is my favorite Hidden Object game out of the 15-20 that I have played.  Fire Maple Games seem to be my favorite designer... I can't wait until they come out with another game.  :)  (hint, hint)This game makes some of the other Hidden Object games look like a joke!  The entire package here is amazing.  Some apps charge $4.99 for games that are half this good!!
A13ULCEJI8MUNQ B00CKG0A0C 4 1371686400 23 Very fun casino slot game.Lots of different game choices.Sound is good,a person feels like they are in a casino.Enjoy playing it very much.
A13ULCEJI8MUNQ B007TBAQCK 5 1382227200 22 A very good casino style game to play.Fast paced,good music,graphics.Extremely fun to play A person feels like they are inside a casino!!!!
A13ULCEJI8MUNQ B00E616R5Q 5 1381104000 38 I really like this fast paced slot game. Big wins,free money daily.Lots of big wins!!!The more you play the more games open up to play.Very good graphics,a very enjoyable game to play.wish more slot games were this fun!!!!
A13ULCEJI8MUNQ B00BN6K97Y 5 1370217600 39 Enjoy playing the games,very real,can play without it costing me money!!!!!!This helps to keep me out of the casino.Good choice of games.This is the best on line slot games I have played,also very easy to send games to friends.
A13ULCEJI8MUNQ B00ARI9CDQ 3 1368835200 22 It's okay,the news is not as current as fox or other news web sites.I would rather use something else for my news.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B00C5HW022 5 1366502400 78 Best game by Alawar yet. Paid 1.99 and worth every penny..beautiful soundtrack and graphics!! The hog.games were challenging and puzzles were great..didn't skip anything. storyline was a little creepy but had a moral backstory to the entire game. time played was about 5 hours and it kept my attention the entire time. one weird thing..at the end there were no credits..it took me back to the beginning and started over..not that I wouldn't mind playing it again. :)
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B008JJS6D2 1 1345334400 57 was supposed to be for kindle fire. game would play for a minute then application error would pop up saying it could not find a secure server for facebook log in. I signed in as a guest and no facebook logo was on any pages. waste of my kindle memory and my time...uninstalled five minutes after download.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B00BI2QOYA 4 1362182400 55 graphics and sound were good..story line was a little confusing at times but overall play was good. the only complaint was it was hard to back up through screens on my fire. the touch area to back up was too close to the bottom. downloaded easily and worth the 2.99 spent to finish the game.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B00ATPVA78 3 1361404800 52 another g5 game with outstanding graphics. nice to see native American culture and story line. the game was relatively short..took about an hour to play and yet its 4.99 for the game...one of the highest priced ones ive come across from g5. feels like a ripoff since its so short in playtime.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B00B4VI8MQ 3 1363132800 48 graphics and sound were nice. this is the first g5 game I haven't bought and played all the way through. the directional arrows/turns etc were juvenile handling at best which made it hard and frustrating to play. the hidden objects were hard to find even using the zoom.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B008GTV9DO 1 1348531200 58 after 5 minutes of checking for updates received an error message stating it could not be installed at this time. would I like to continue the download. I clicked yes and it started the samebprocess all over again..ended up stuck in an endless loop without the game ever downloading..does not work on kindle fire with excellant wi-fi connection
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B009C7ZQM4 5 1382054400 57 I had the issue of low memory..low storage on my first generation kindle fire. I cleaned everything off except two apps and still had no storage. this app cleaned videos I didn't know were on my device and the residuals left by uninstalled apps for a total of 2.5 Gb. definately earns 5 stars...very easy to use.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B00AKJTBL0 5 1361059200 21 great graphics with an interesting story line..little weird but held my interest. would recommend d this maker and game..worth the price.
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B009PSV1HE 5 1351728000 25 Just like on the computer but with the convience of my kindle. One annoyance,it keeps wanting you to purchase bonus levels..other than that..ok so far
A13UN1F6F8JZ39 B00AIQP9DE 3 1360368000 55 I expected more...you ag halfway through then pay 4.99 and the game is practically over. would not recommend paying or playing this game. all g5 games have a childish immature quality to them no matter how dark they try to make them. recommendation...if you love hidden object games play alawar games...they are worth paying for.
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00C5J4MO4 5 1376438400 25 I love playing this game. It's cute and has great graphics. Definitely recommend to all. Beware of the time you will spend playing it. lol
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00CMF27DE 5 1369094400 20 this game is lots of fun. recommended!! could play all day long. keeps me busy and keeps the boredom away!
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B0063GORYU 5 1343088000 41 I am totally addicted to this app. If and when u download it u will definitely not be disappointed. The only drawback would be not enough background color choices. I'd like to see maybe red or purple cards and backgrounds :-)
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00ABGEFWC 1 1369526400 182 I've been playing this game for a couple of months. Bought everything that could be bought with coins and had saved over 4 million coins for future new items. Spent over 200 in real money to get bling to buy most of the bling items. Experienced some glitches, so I thought uninstalling then reinstalling would help as that has helped with other games I play. Once I reinstalled I diccovered that EVERYTHING!!!!!! I had is GONE! I contacted the company and sent emails...to no avail. I am very upset and am looking into seeing if I can at least get my 200 bucks back. I had this synced with my facebook, so there should have been no problem with my things being restored onto my kindle. I will NEVER download another app from gameloft again!! I implore you not to download this game, because if you do, eventually you will have so many glitches you will have to uninstall and then Gameloft will steal everything you took the time and effort to collect. I really hope this doesn't happen to someone else!
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B007Q3KX42 1 1348099200 51 This app gave my kindle fire a virus and I had to pay my tech guy 99 bucks to get it off!!!!! I reported all of this to Amazon and they sent a reply that this is happening every day and they are INVESTIGATING the developers!!!! Do NOT download this app!!!!!!
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00AMEFZ72 4 1375920000 38 it's ok so far. not real impressed with the setup but there seems to be no glitches. keeping my fingers crossed that it stays that way. if you like bingo games this one is worth a try :-)
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B008K6G8CK 1 1377648000 122 I used to love playing video bingo on this app. I always got a good amount of bingos & coins. I really like the whole redo thing, but I've been playing for 2 days straight and NO bingos!! I had 453,000 coins and am down to 20,000. Cmon!!! If the bingo ratio does not improve, and SOON, I'll just delete the app and find a better one. Or at least one that I can bingo on. Improve the video bingo & you'll get a better rating from me. This game has went sadly downhill since the redo. Am deleting it until gsn treats their players better. Will not spend real money on coins when I can't even win fake ones. Ta -ta!
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B006OCM0G0 3 1345939200 92 I love this app and all my other story apps, but the glitches with not receiving rewards and money for food are getting very annoying and starting to be a big waste of my time. If I'm not going to make money that I earned, then why play at all? The prices for walls and floors are ridiculous as well. But that's a moot point when you're not receiving money that's rightfully yours. PLEASE fix these glitches in ALL story apps so I can get back to enjoying my games again. Thanx!!!
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00E5GJ7QS 5 1375315200 41 This is seriously the best Bingo app I have found so far. Bingos are extremely easy to win and they are very generous with coins, credits, etc. I honestly could just sit all day and do nothing but play Bingo! LOL.
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00B2TET3C 5 1369180800 21 this game easy, fun and doesn't cost alot of money to play. i like the blue bingo chips to coins convert.
A13UOQE2JG5MWX B00FJWGHZG 4 1383955200 37 SWEET!!One of the cutest candy games I've played on here. It's pretty easy,  the graphics are wonderful  and it's a great way to fill up some free time during the day...or night! Download this. You'll love it!!
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00CQ9U1PW 1 1377388800 29 I love his mustache. Does that make me gay? Stupid game or maybe it's me. I just don't know the point. You don't need finger dexterity or a brain
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00C7TAF3Y 4 1369958400 23 I can't figure it out. I'm stuck. The clues are vague and the strippers are pretty. Check it put. Check Ch cha church
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00FAPF5U0 5 1392249600 25 You push down on your left arrow while punching in ' cheat Cole's and nothing happens but keep it up. Something has got to give.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B009HQ9UHC 4 1368489600 39 Fun, a little difficult but fun. The irs went after Willie Nelson. Why is Mark Levin banned from England? Hey did you know Obama is corrupt and so is Clinton &#34;our next president&#34; unless On a get a assassinated.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B009C7JS14 5 1392336000 20 I know the weather. It sucks most places but it's mostly pretty ok. Now I know how it is everywhere.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B008P1EWIM 5 1391472000 24 And the days and then you fly over there where the grass is greener, usually Florida but beware there are some shifty people there.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B004X80QNG 2 1384473600 24 It doesn't tell me what I don't already know. I could compare it to a democrat but at least the pocket conformity won't lie
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B008RA3X5E 4 1377388800 40 If you don't know what time it is, it's time to get this application. Those crazy Greeks invented time after time was found and the world adopted it so the least you can do is get this on your android.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00FB13Y74 5 1405900800 21 The game is a racing game with no guaranteed winner and you have to know the code to get extra stuff.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B008N3TLNI 5 1403222400 32 I been looking for a game that I could play with other people and not having to invite them over. This is a fun way to spend a minute of your day.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00CELIPL4 2 1369958400 23 Sneezing is more fun. I hate sneezing. But I recommend it to all my economies who can'seem to find me. Break yourself, fools
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00DJFIMW6 5 1376870400 42 This is a fast game when you get in the 90,000 range. It is super fun but don't let the kids get above 200,000 bananas because for some strange reason the father figure looks like he masturbates in front of the dog.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B009XAJI8S 5 1367539200 35 Can't beat the price. As long as you got access, you are good to go. Black or white, it don't matter your skin color. It's free, y'all. So get it. It's tv on your computer.
A13UQNMCNE8LPG B00GH4YC34 5 1395705600 32 My doctor says it's a miracle and it's all because of these recordings. My wife finally left. My boss finally fired me and my dog finally died, always popping in the house.
A13URWJ5FF7NRF B00DJFIMW6 5 1386028800 30 This is more fun than subway surfer. I love the graphics and of course the minions are super fun! I l look forward to many more levels of minion runs!
A13URWJ5FF7NRF B00702PZME 5 1337385600 45 works well and is entertaining enough as a distraction without being over the top challenging. I would recommend it! sometimes you just need that mental stretch to get you through a moment and this is one of them. no annoying songs or sound effects too.
A13URWJ5FF7NRF B006VW94HQ 5 1338595200 42 I have enjoyed this app. it doesn't take a lot of time to play and is great as a distraction. I started with the free app and loved it so much I went back and bought the full version. no glitches either!
A13URWJ5FF7NRF B007PT3QOQ 4 1368230400 47 For some reason I thought I would actually be travelling the trail. However setting up a town is pretty fun! I think it was worth it. Just went fishing and then shot a bear! Would still like to see the classic game brought back with better graphics...
A13URWJ5FF7NRF B00A3NQNUU 5 1361577600 32 This is a fun alternative to smurfs.  I like the medieval theme with fantasy. Watch out Merlin! The graphics are cute and the game is simple enough to not be time consuming.
A13US97ZVP6NQK B009UX2YAC 5 1369872000 26 This fast paced game allows players to buy and select characters to interact with subway stations in different countries. The game is just flat out awesome.
A13US97ZVP6NQK B00CQ9U1PW 5 1372982400 24 amazing. way to take one out for your boss. its like an entertaining stress doll on a kindle. I really enjoy this game alot
A13US97ZVP6NQK B00CAK052Q 4 1369872000 20 This game goes by fast and agrivayes you to the bone. but it makes up in great trucks and courses.
A13UVLA11U65MC B00998UF9U 4 1392336000 20 I love this game it is very fun and addicting. I love all the clothes and quests. I recommend it.
A13UVLA11U65MC B00EBE8MUG 5 1394582400 22 Very awesome app fun game so far I know most of the shows very easy just wish the pictures were more clear
A13UVLA11U65MC B00FX6ZBXC 5 1384041600 42 Love it it's so addictive I can't stop playing it win or lose I love how you can customize your chum I love how fun it is. This game is awesome, I recommend for all word game lovers it's better than scrabble
A13UVLA11U65MC B009HKL4B8 3 1385424000 30 I love this game, I use to play it on the computer all the time. And on PlayStation. It takes a minute to download but after that everything works great.
A13UVLA11U65MC B00ESCOI7C 3 1394582400 24 Very entertaining game fun and keeps me occupied on boring rainy days passes time quickly also good to play when wanting to ignore ppl
A13UVRZ1Z4X2DZ B00D0VA0UQ 5 1396915200 20 I really like this game. It is very challenging. You really have to think and it really boosts it memory
A13UVRZ1Z4X2DZ B00CAW96DI 5 1396569600 21 It is very good. It is challenging and you have to think about a lot of it. I really like it.
A13UVRZ1Z4X2DZ B007OX6DIY 2 1403222400 29 This game is awesome. But would you please update it like it is on android so we can play multiplayer. It would be great if you would do that
A13UWUPZQC5XVA B00FELZD70 5 1395878400 31 It's a good way to pass the time. At first you think ok not much fun. But once you get a little further it gets more challenging to finish the goals.
A13UWUPZQC5XVA B00AMEFZ72 5 1374537600 29 So far really liking the game! It's fun and its easy to keep up, specially since your cards blink when there is a number on them that's been called
A13UWUPZQC5XVA B00CXBSYVG 5 1373241600 39 Out of all the bingo games I have played, so far think this one is my fav!  Its loads of fun and you go at your own pace basically. I definitely approve of the name of the game :)
A13UWVR2DT8RDJ B00EEDJM2Q 5 1402272000 33 What a wonderful way to enhance your mind and stimulate the brain.  With so many levels, it is a sure way to improve your thinking...I dare you to just play a few levels!!
A13UWVR2DT8RDJ B00E8KLWB4 5 1393977600 36 I played this game on my mother s Kindle and loved it so much I had to get it myself.  Great fun, wonderful challenges.  I wish it would move a little faster, but otherwise, well done!!
A13UWVR2DT8RDJ B0086700CM 5 1358380800 34 This game is fantastic!  I am constantly &quot;running again &quot;  getting a little farther sometimes....laughing at the comments at the end (&quot;hard to run without a head &quot;)  Great job...passing it on to others!
A13UWVR2DT8RDJ B00I3D27CU 5 1395532800 22 Thanks for creating this great game...I love the graphics . And the puzzles were just right in the difficulty level...I Want More!!
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B004VMTI42 4 1363219200 23 I switched from opera mini to this for mobile devices. I got it on my phone and Kindle. Almost want it on.my laptop
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B00FAX6XQC 4 1386460800 27 I had it before an earlier version, and this is almost a new game. Its easier to play and upgrades make a clearer difference in the game.
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B00HDRTGDK 4 1391990400 23 I like it. a bunch of old stuff from the 90s oh what fun. if you liked the 90 you will like it
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B00C2VIA52 3 1380585600 22 First card game like it so far. Hope it get better when after the campaign. I'm a wait before playing real ppl
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B009C7ZQM4 4 1379808000 24 It works for me. I found a bunch of stuff I thought was gone still there and got rid of it w this. ith
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B005LIYX5Y 4 1361923200 20 I got it for my Galaxy now I got it on my kindle. It's even better on the bigger screen
A13UYQ2NFUPM7C B00E7VV2RS 5 1381449600 20 it a good simple game. you'll pass a lot of time playing enjoy l.I like the little people running around.
A13UZLIUEN6HAM B009HKL4B8 5 1349740800 31 soooooooo fun and addicting love the graphics i use to play on a friends ipad. i been waiting for it to come on the kindle fire now I cant stop playing!!!

A13UZLIUEN6HAM B006PH7WBM 5 1336435200 26 this game is so fun add me simplyebony8 I play the bakery and the pet game as well :) I send gifts everyday and visit too!
A13UZOQIUGKRQ1 B0063IH60K 5 1341619200 21 Lots of options to create your perfect game. Even has a left-handed option! You can choose winning deal or random deal.
A13UZOQIUGKRQ1 B008JK6W5K 5 1344038400 21 Love this game. The whole family enjoys playing. We can't wait to get to the next level. Really makes you think.
A13UZOQIUGKRQ1 B00E3WJRIM 5 1381104000 29 This is a lot like the tv show Wheel of Fortune. Lots of fun to play. Playing against someone, even if you don't know them, makes it more exciting.
A13UZZF0B0K3S B004XJHBCE 4 1323043200 27 you have to be logged into the amazon app store to use it. i don't know if that is true for all amazon apps but unexpected behavior.
A13UZZF0B0K3S B006OOHYIC 5 1346889600 24 This is a very well designed game with nice graphics. Smooth play makes this a relaxing app to play. Not too hard so far.
A13V0ROCBFUBJL B007OXASB2 5 1342915200 41 and that is all thank you so much that ts all that I have to say is that I love tglhis game and I wish you could like get perments so I can expand my len wouth out having a friend

A13V0ROCBFUBJL B008TQ16OG 5 1402704000 27 in my mind i think this game is awesome. i enjoy playing this game in the car on long car trips it gives you somthing to do
A13V233HV874F4 B006MI4JEM 5 1390348800 24 I like you can pick a background that you like and then do your word making. Great Brain training game. Enjoy it a lot.
A13V233HV874F4 B00HIFVID8 5 1388966400 20 Great. it is a joy to work and sometimes win. Worth getting You should try it you will like. Buy
A13V233HV874F4 B005AJ6ISO 5 1390348800 20 Good reading a nice thought to brighten your day with quotes on Jesus and what he can do for you.
A13V233HV874F4 B00AR1AUAW 5 1390348800 21 It gets you thinking. you pair a word then realize it matches to another similiar. So that is fun to do.
A13V233HV874F4 B00DWZ3S90 5 1395878400 27 Worth getting it is loads of fun. And it's free. Many levels sometimes you get stuck but then you get out and move on. Worth your while.
A13V233HV874F4 B007XF3WFA 5 1390348800 20 Great word game.Easy to use and keeps your mind working to help with memory. Worth the free offer to buy.
A13V3VC66QUL6Z B00632HWOG 5 1328400000 21 I love this app.  I had been using my browser on my kindle - this makes getting my emails super easy!
A13V3VC66QUL6Z B006JNH7YY 5 1325116800 31 I am still playing this game and am enjoying it immensely - I love hidden object games and this looks great on my new kindle fire.  I would definitely recommend it.
A13V4H17BGPPMM B00CLVQ8GG 4 1370563200 26 So far, it runs well on my fire HD.....have no issues at all.....over all a very good game, would tell someone to download and play it!
A13V4H17BGPPMM B00CWY76CC 5 1397088000 26 Very simple game... but also entertaining...it is easy to get frustrated on level 10, but just remember to take a breath and keep it all calm....lol
A13V4H17BGPPMM B00FEMJF6O 5 1403136000 32 I don't even mind the in app purchases....this game is really quite addicting....but I'm not complaining....lol if u like building and don't mind waiting for things to be built, made or grow!!
A13V5X35ZT4B9J B007ZGO7EM 5 1352764800 20 I like this calculator a lot better then the one I had before the one I had before was stupied
A13V5X35ZT4B9J B00BS3UFCQ 4 1366070400 20 it is fun but it can be hard yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yep yepero
A13V5X35ZT4B9J B00HX49SM2 3 1396137600 23 this was the trial version and it wasn't long enough to tell if I would like it or not, need more trial levels
A13V5X35ZT4B9J B00EUADLTS 4 1387065600 53 This is a very good app the only thing you can't do is edit your profile and post pictures other then that it is a very good app you can fallow people look at people profile you can also have more then one profile on this app you can switch back  and forth
A13V5X35ZT4B9J B00CZDSK7K 5 1377302400 26 this game is really fun me and my friend are playing it right know. you can children and when Guayaquil growup you can get them married
A13V87NIQ2LVBC B005ZXWMUS 4 1337299200 49 I got this app for my cheapo BigLots tablet. At first it would lock up after playing for a minute, but I changed my quality settings on the Netflix website and it streams grear now. The ui is a little slow, but that's probably because my tablet is cheap.
A13V87NIQ2LVBC B0085PEG16 3 1354665600 136 It's not a bad game, but it's not very complex and get old pretty fast. You roam around the galaxy shooting enemies and collecting upgrades. The upgrades pile up pretty fast and before long you can kill any ship with just one shot. There's not much strategy involved once you get a really powerful ship. You can take out several ships before they can ever hit you, you just pop into the sector and shot them all.Eventually the other ships can barely even harm you. I don't think I ever saw an enemy ship move, they just sit there and let your torpedoes hit them, though they are easy to avoid at any distance.The game needs to be a little more complex and engaging to be fun long term, but it's fun for a few hours.
A13V87NIQ2LVBC B007OAGY40 2 1354233600 28 The controls are so bad I deleted it almost immediately. The screen jumps around and aiming is difficult. It looks just like the original,but it's not worth laying.
A13VA809MDK B0055SWM08 5 1361404800 56 This app is simple and beautiful. Easy yet challenging, and gives loads of satisfaction! :-) I like it better then angry birds. I'm glad I got it while it was free app of the day, but it's definitely worth 99 cents. I also got quell reflect when it was the free app of the day! :-D
A13VFS11BI8J88 B0066T8M1I 5 1361491200 37 The app is exactly what it says it is. Monopoly for a mobile phone. While its not the same as the actual board game it is great for the mobile experience. Great adaptation of a classic game
A13VFS11BI8J88 B004UBTYHU 5 1361491200 37 I got this app for free, so I have to say I would have been satisfied regardless of how well it worked. With that said it worked great and was actually really fun. Would suggest to others
A13VFS11BI8J88 B006D1ONE4 5 1361491200 55 To be honest the only reason I got this app was because it was free in the Amazon App Store. But this was one of the only apps I got from the Amazon Android market that I actually used consistently. Even for a Disney product it was fun for me and I'm in college lol
A13VGN5GYRW83L B006VXRNYG 4 1373932800 26 my son just now has begun to take an interest in this one.  before he would only play with games that he played on my phone.
A13VGN5GYRW83L B008JHQXK2 3 1376092800 37 He is slowing branching out and trying some new puzzles on the tablet.  However, I don't believe that he has ever played this one.  He has his favorites and he tends to go right back to them.
A13VHP01J63PE0 B007693VXG 5 1334361600 21 so awesome if you have the kindle fire you should totally get this this game is so totally super awesome seriously
A13VHP01J63PE0 B0086700CM 5 1338854400 27 Most AWESOME game ever. So AWESOMELY cool. Everyone who is AWESOME should get this game. If you do not get this game you are totally not AWESOME.
A13VHP01J63PE0 B00AJ1S1CY 5 1356048000 22 this is awesome it is the like totally best most awesome and cute app ever everyone should get this app like totally!!!!!!
A13VHP01J63PE0 B007BPYCAG 1 1333843200 20 This game is soooooooo STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really don't recommend getting this because you don't  play anything. DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A13VI22XTT89DX B00AMEFZ72 3 1395273600 46 I'm disappointed in the game.  I have played a lot of bingo games and this is the tightest one to pay I have played. The graphics are good but it is frustrating because you can only play for a few minutes before your coin runs out.
A13VI22XTT89DX B008YOBYNG 2 1358985600 29 It is very tight and never gives much in a win. Always wants you to purchase more coins so you have to wait 4 hours for them to collect.
A13VI22XTT89DX B00B2TET3C 4 1369440000 29 I just wish the points renewed more often. It is a fun little game. I don't like to pay for coins so I just wait for point to renew.
A13VI22XTT89DX B0069F2RCE 2 1358985600 21 For a novice at poker it was a frustrating experience. I could find no where to help explain what was happening.
A13VJJ8CRY8O18 B00BMW6ER8 5 1395100800 21 I love this game. It challenge's you and you want to out do your score. Plus I love the different rooms!!
A13VJJ8CRY8O18 B009WJNXAE 5 1380326400 31 I love this game!! If I'm not able to get to my computer I'm always able to play this game on my Kindle!! It's fun to try to beat the levels.
A13VJJ8CRY8O18 B00E78QIDE 5 1379289600 28 This game really makes you think! It's fun to try to figure it out with my teenage daughter. We try to see who can figure it out first!
A13VJJ8CRY8O18 B00DYY92MG 5 1379289600 30 This game is interesting and fun! I say interesting because you forget some of the shows that are out there or that have been out there!! It's a fun game!
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B0058VW36U 5 1340409600 26 I had to beg my mom for me to spend money on it. (and a lot of other games) Its the coolest game ever! 5 stars!
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B0089ZM1GY 4 1341446400 31 I like this game a lot. Its a great game full if stratagy and a little bit of adventure. I reccomend today because today its the free app of the day.
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B0086700CM 5 1340409600 38 Don't listen to those people who say its bad. Its the best game ever!!! Ive been waiting for months for them to have it kindle fire edition! Its the best game ever! Oh wait I already said that.
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B007VT07QU 4 1340409600 32 I was looking all over the app store to find a adventure game. Finally I found this one. I like it but you really have to pay for the full version? Why?
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B004SUWR2C 4 1340409600 21 I love the game uno. Its a great app. But its a bit expensive. I strongly recommend it for most people.
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B007DKC922 3 1340409600 21 This game is kinda boring. My mom keeps tapping on the screen like a maniac. I don't really recommend this app.
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B0085N9I84 5 1340409600 21 This game is the best. I love the little cute monsters and me and my mom play it all the time.
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B006OBWGHO 3 1340409600 32 I downloaded this app and thought it was a game of fun stratagy. It got old quickly. P.S I never got &quot;permissions&quot; when I was playing and I'm actually telling the truth.
A13VNYZ70TG8ZR B00769WNK8 4 1340409600 30 I really like this game but is so stupid a hard. I keeping dying and the stupid grave pops up. I would recommend the app to people who like challenges.
A13VQ3DYQY7Y64 B00DBCJLOA 3 1379203200 21 I really didn't play with it much.just didn't keep me wanting to come b a k to it .don't like gambling
A13VQ3DYQY7Y64 B008RMEGXA 3 1379203200 24 I thought I would like it but was just to busy with other items that were offered to me.I ended up taking it off
A13VQ3DYQY7Y64 B00DJK2TO8 3 1379203200 25 I thought it would be ok for my grandchild but the songs were to old so he didn't like it maybe for way older kids
A13VQ3DYQY7Y64 B00B9AGS42 3 1391472000 20 Didn't keep my interest.was hard some to find items then names wouldn't match those items.I haven't really played it anymore
A13VR1EVCXEEK1 B00EKDZEF4 5 1389744000 27 Just be careful, you can waste lots of time sitting with this. I have both additions ( each with 300 levels) and will pay them over again
A13VR1EVCXEEK1 B00EDEMLTW 4 1389744000 33 I got stuck on one level and spent 2 weeks to break it, but only in my spar time. It is a good way for us older folks to keep our brains going.
A13VRKQQQQ3256 B00GY0HJ4K 5 1392768000 36 This game is super fun to play! Every few months I scan the apps store fro a new game n this one was a great choice!! And, u can connect to friends playing on Facebook too!
A13VRKQQQQ3256 B00846GKTW 5 1368576000 29 Lovvvvve this game! It even got me through a rough time in my life, kept my mind occupied and motivated to keep smiling!! I even compete against friends :)
A13VRKQQQQ3256 B007ZGO7EM 5 1380499200 30 Great. Easy. Quick. This calculator is a must have for any phone or tablet. I use it all the time for my kids and to calculate orders for my business!
A13VRKQQQQ3256 B00EBQRZBG 3 1382918400 20 Cute animated colorful game to pass time! It's a fun way to calm yourself but still keep your mind active!
A13VRKQQQQ3256 B00EBE8MUG 4 1403136000 22 Images are blurry. I guess they didn't party for rights but still a cool game to pass the time on your kindle
A13VRKQQQQ3256 B00CWY76CC 4 1385596800 30 This game is fun and great for the whole family! I would tell everyone to download for a fun time, you'll easily spend time trying to escape! Fun fun fun
A13VSWWOJSB2JC B00BMR4RIG 1 1381276800 30 Not much data...no maps. No way to get detail on future forcasts. Two or three other free weather apps provide a lot more detail and much more useful weather information.
A13VSWWOJSB2JC B008D29K7G 3 1359158400 29 The latest up date does not let you email an article to someone....what's up?  It used to let you... A few stories,but not as many as other news apps
A13VSWWOJSB2JC B0064X7FVE 4 1323129600 29 My husband has this app on his IPod and it is really slick. No local radar maps in this version. Lots of data but not very helpful without radar
A13VSWWOJSB2JC B006VW94HQ 4 1342828800 23 A good 5-10 minute time passer. It would be a great teaching tool for understanding the English language. Every teen should play this.
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B00I0WIUHK 5 1394236800 27 Ok but not overly entertaining.  Seems to operate well as compared to other apps.I have loaded and deleted numerous slot games recently.  Still deciding on this one
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B004TTY694 5 1359244800 55 Overall this is a great list creation app.  I currently have numerous short and long term &#34;TODO&#34; lists as well as stored data lists that I am working from.  My only regret is the lack of a separate keyboard to attach to the Kindle Fire.  The touch screen works well but is a bit cumbersome
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B008M87GJK 5 1359244800 33 As a guy with a foreign born European wife, this app allows me to get a broader view of the world.  This includes occasionally how the rest of the world views the USA
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B00F8L2VO4 4 1391212800 38 Yes, this app does what I expected.  I am improving my German language skills.  It quickly demonstrated to me that even though I can speak the language with some fluency, my grammer and other language abilities were terrible.
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B004SZHD3K 5 1359244800 29 If you enjoy gaming, then this app will allow you to practice your technique (-;}  It doesn't cost you a dime and you likely win on a regular basis
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B007ZGO7EM 4 1359244800 37 This is one of those that a. price is great, b. simple to use, c. need to know some basic calculation formulas if you want something a bit more elaborate with out getting into a scientific calculator.
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B005V1N71W 4 1359244800 26 Haven't used a lot of the features as yet.  It appears to be a useful entertainment gadget that I will get more use out of it.
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B0067RQYNW 5 1391212800 44 This app allows me to use my Kindle Fire as an office tool while traveling on business.  It eliminated the need to carry a laptop and accessories necessary to run it for extended period.  I now carry only the Kindle and a charger.  YEA!!
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B006RXD2I6 4 1359244800 22 All I can really say about this is so many games yet so little time to experiment.  Fortunately it does give lessons
A13VXKO7KDUIYJ B006QC6YL0 4 1359244800 28 I wouldn't personally take this stuff to seriously.  Many of the recommended remedies appear to border on or actually folk remedies with little or not basis in fact.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B004SBS8LA 5 1371686400 22 I love this version of Angry Birds!  Really fun to see the birds fly away as their cages are hit and opened!
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B00CKOYVG8 2 1371686400 36 This version is not for playing alone.  I'm not on Facebook so it really doesn't work for me.  Nice tutorial in the beginning since I had no idea about some of the birds or the extra's.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B004SJ3AXI 5 1369008000 23 I found Angry Birds Seasons to be a very enjoyable game to play.  I think anyone who likes Angry Birds would like this.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B009E8VZIK 3 1378166400 30 This game is ok, but it moves quickly and I haven't quite figured it out yet.  The instructions are good, but I'm having a hard time figuring out the timing.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B00GXH3TGG 4 1399593600 31 This is a nice slots game with the possibility of getting true free services in Las Vegas!  Takes a while to load but is fun to play!  Free chips every hour!
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B00HEFEDAM 5 1389052800 70 I love this game!  It's fun and very addictive!  I couldn't get it on my Kindle to begin with but was able to get on my cell phone and played it continuously!  I love making the matches and trying to get higher points.  I was finally able to get it on my Kindle so now I go back and forth between that and the cell phone to play this game!
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B009WO7NQO 4 1375401600 21 New backgrounds for space and the crazy birds do different things.  It's a nice challenge!  It's a great change of pace.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B009KS4XRO 3 1371686400 20 It's ok but hard to see the numbers on the Kindle.  I've only opened it once but will try again.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B004SJ3BCI 5 1369008000 23 I really had a great time playing Angry Birds Free.  It was easy to download on my Kindle and I would recommend it.
A13VZ6VJXYYN99 B00F8H0LM2 5 1380672000 45 I love Star Wars II.  This version is much more fun and easier to play than the first one!  I would get stuck for weeks on end in that version but not this one - maybe only a day or so.  I'm really enjoying it!
A13W0DTBNJ7XYT B007ZGO7EM 5 1357430400 33 I'm just using the basic functions of this calculator but it's just what I wanted.  Easy to use (and see).  And there is an option to view all of the calculations.  Love it!
A13W0DTBNJ7XYT B008L29K6E 4 1357430400 22 I've enjoyed this game although it seems to be more about logic than art.  Reminds me of sudoku.  The graphics are interesting.
A13W0DTBNJ7XYT B004SJ3BCI 5 1357430400 41 Okay, so I'm the last person around to play Angry Birds.  But I'm hooked.  The freebie has a ton of ads so I will likely upgrade.  I'm glad the freebie was available to try out.  This game is hilarious and addictive.
A13W0DTBNJ7XYT B009LQ8X58 5 1383177600 29 Have been using this app for a couple of months now and I am satisfied with the performance. Works for me and I am glad to have it available.
A13W0DTBNJ7XYT B004VOJT0I 3 1363910400 24 It's okay for what it is.  I'm used to the full web version, and prefer that.  But the app is okay for an idea-generator.
A13W0DTBNJ7XYT B009EEFTMC 5 1363910400 131 My newest addition.  I love this game.  It's not like Rubic's cube (which I could never do), although the graphic may remind you of a Rubic's cube, if you're old enought to remember those.  It's more like a kid's Memory game (where players - usually pre-school children - turn cards over to match pictures) except it's in 3-D and on steriods.  It's more difficult than it looks but not too difficult that it's not fun.  I keep thinking of my college courses on the psychology of perception and industrial psychology when I play this game: you'll find your self tapping a flower for a heart; a blue starburst for a yellow one!  There are three modes for playing, for some variety, altho I play the puzzle mode most of the time.
A13W5XMOQ75IXU B00DPGB68G 5 1387929600 20 i just love card games and it keeps me playing its very challenging trying to win the game love it
A13W5XMOQ75IXU B00BL0I7WG 5 1404172800 23 I love playing challenging games I especially like finding objects and keeps my mind busy so please keep them coming thank you Jennifer
A13W5XMOQ75IXU B00B8JDIOM 5 1405123200 36 I play this game on pogo and I was amazed that I can play it on my kindle fire I play it all the time love it thank you very much I love playing this game
A13WCJHT45MEVW B00COVCV50 5 1372723200 24 perfect for when you have a little timd on your hands or are on a long road trip to Cali with the parental units!
A13WCJHT45MEVW B00FX6ZBXC 5 1389139200 24 super fun and a good way to see how fast your brain works and your level of vocabulary. also great when you are bored
A13WCJHT45MEVW B00AREIAI8 5 1373241600 30 i luv this game it is so fun. i play it when i have some free time. its like you get to have fun and play around with beautiful animals.
A13WDZUGH5S7SO B008OOYALE 5 1356998400 30 I love breeding and creating new draons. the more dragons you have the more money you get. you can spend your own money on it but you don't have to.
A13WDZUGH5S7SO B008JJS6D2 5 1374278400 21 I like it. It moves fast and you can quickly move up to the next level where you can play longer.
A13WDZUGH5S7SO B00B2TET3C 5 1374364800 32 one of my two favorite bingos. Moves fast.  You don't have to spend your own hard earn cash to move up.  And I like how you can feed the cat, it cute.
A13WDZUGH5S7SO B0098LBZPG 5 1355443200 22 Great game I wish there was more ways to get more coins.  it is easy to play and many ways to play.
A13WDZUGH5S7SO B00FVVR2ZO 5 1387843200 30 This game is great and I like all the rooms and the different modes for each room. The only Thing I don't like is that it is slow to advance.
A13WQ5RDWYJXMB B008OOYALE 4 1359244800 34 Yeah this IS cool, but I like dragonvale to. This is the best game with &quot;story&quot; in the name. Only thing I don't like is you need the coins from the dragons to breed
A13WQ5RDWYJXMB B00AREIAI8 5 1364601600 31 You start out with one horse, then you can get more. You can even get zebras or unicorns. You actually take care of them too. Not one of those cheap apps.
A13WQ5RDWYJXMB B0085N9I84 5 1359331200 31 This game is fun. The monsters are a cool thing to look at. You can expand the place to have a certain shape. It's a cool game, and I recommend it.
A13WQ5RDWYJXMB B00876UUN6 4 1359244800 24 I like this game. It's fun to play for a while. The mogas are either cute or cool. Great game for girls and boys.
A13WQ5RDWYJXMB B00GZP30G0 5 1393977600 47 Love the holiday related events and the game itself, just really wish that Patrick wasn't an end game thing. And that restart glitch is fixed and has been for a while so stop giving it one star for that. Its a good game, and glitches get fixed.
A13WQ5RDWYJXMB B009ZKSPDK 5 1359936000 24 This has weapons like you can't get on minecraft pocket edition,it saves your worlds and has werewolves and coyotes. the animals look better too.
A13WT73JWG873B B009HKL4B8 5 1388016000 110 Ok when I first saw this game I was like cool the sims because I played the sims 2 &amp; 3 and I saw the other sims app called the sims 3 well I was like it cost $7 dollars and I saw a lot I mean alt of bad reviews on it and this one had slot of good reviews I was like what the one that cost money isn't that good and the free one if awesome well I hope they lower the price on the sims 3 app to like $1-3 dollar on kindle fire so I can see which is better. But this one my game
A13WT73JWG873B B00EEL0LGY 5 1396569600 58 Its a fun and exiting game you will love it if your in to like action like racing games you will like it its easy to get money to upgrade and to get more like alot isnt that much its only like 1.99-2.99 forgot sorry for 50.000 coins its worth it thats all i have to tell you!
A13WT73JWG873B B00AEORXR0 2 1395360000 32 Please fix this I've been playing msp on my kindle hd it sometimes works and sometimes it doesn't work please fix for kindle only 2/5 till it's fix I'll give u 5/5!
A13WT73JWG873B B00HBVON72 5 1389830400 23 Fun to guess and play if you think of getting this then get it. It's worth downloading if you know all about food
A13X1O9CD7C5W3 B008TY8PKG 2 1365638400 59 I'm an adult and I got stuck on two of the levels and it took way to long to figure it out and was very frustrating.  Triple that and you have an idea of how my grandson felt.  Simple directions please available to help get through levels.  Actually we are still stuck on the level we left off on.
A13X1O9CD7C5W3 B00BC4I19U 3 1365638400 20 My grandson got frustrated because it was difficult to really find the eggs.  Needs to be more child friendly.  Thanks.
A13X1O9CD7C5W3 B0064TVQ5E 5 1365638400 21 Very challenging and fun.  I find it hard to turn the game off.  Never boring and the different configurations are great.
A13X2D3O2HMDTJ B00ALKKM98 4 1391990400 36 It keeps your mind active so that is good, but when they start asking for money I will stop it as I don't pay to play games money is to hard to come by these days.
A13X2D3O2HMDTJ B0063GORYU 5 1391990400 26 I play this all the time and I love it, time passes so fast when I am playing it so everyone try it and enjoy !!
A13X2D3O2HMDTJ B008R9OIUO 4 1391990400 31 This was fun and I enjoyed it a lot but after so many islands it wanted me to pay for them and that I will NOT do so I canceled.it !!
A13X2JVLB9C4OZ B007DKC922 1 1369267200 38 This game  was hard to exit out. Also to play the game I had to leave the game and  view other things to get free coins. I do not want  to leave a game just to play it.
A13X2JVLB9C4OZ B00BC4I19U 5 1363478400 21 You must be quick to catch the bunny. move the screen around to retrieve all eggs and timer. Not to bad
A13X2JVLB9C4OZ B004JZBGWI 4 1369699200 43 I really enjoy this app. Notes, appts. Are all together in one app. Pretty colors too. You can adjust your own font for the letters . Now if  they would add a calculator and less battery drain this app would be even better.
A13X2JVLB9C4OZ B00H2ZM1GC 4 1404172800 159 This game is so awesome. I am a MAJOR animaljam player. When this came out I wanted it so bad. So I got it. You people who are saying its bad because its the same level, maybe ur not just getting high enough cause the higher u go the more gems a gem is worth and the background changes. Although this game is really cool, it has some flaws. It does not have girl eyes and sometimes it freezes momentarily. Smartbomb if you want me to give it five stars then fix these and I have really cool idea for the you animaljam players that I think you would agree on this. Smartbomb please make it so you sprinkle in some diamonds every once in awhile its hard to get diamonds on aj, do this and I would call it best game ever. I LOVE AJ!!!!! :-)  oh and btw look me up on aj my username is princessglamgem88077
A13X2MZUJBABA3 B00BOW41P8 3 1379635200 22 Site is ok but not user friendly as my cell phone. I already pay for an online  subscription but this doesn't apply
A13X2MZUJBABA3 B0067RQYNW 1 1380931200 21 It's free, go figure out why, then go watch TV or read a fairy tale on your Kindle. A big waste.
A13X2PFNMR13EX B00BJ9VBLI 5 1373932800 31 This game is easy enough to play, yet it gives you puzzles that are just hard enough to keep you entertained! I know I'll enjoy this game for a long time.
A13X2PFNMR13EX B007F2EGFQ 4 1382054400 20 I just started playing but I am already hooked. All the gameloft games are great. Can't wait to see more.
A13X2PFNMR13EX B00CUWWLWG 4 1383696000 63 I haven't been playing for long but I am already hooked. I can't wait to see what comes next. I really enjoy playing shipwrecked island too but like any of these games, you have to spend real money to continue. Some of these games are worth it if you look at them like any other arcade games. You pay to play those, right?
A13X4IOQ6RBX4L B008WXNBWG 5 1399075200 24 I have it on my laptop and missed not having it on my notepad.It's a great little tool.  It saves a lot of lookups.
A13X4X3TKH8XYR B00B5KHZA2 5 1361491200 31 This is also a very different hidden object game.  You have several scenes in which you have to find the hidden objects, as well as 3 different ways to find them.
A13X4X3TKH8XYR B0063IH60K 5 1361491200 20 I have Solitaire on my mobile phone, also, and play it all the time.  I like the product very much.
A13X4X3TKH8XYR B0064TVQ5E 4 1361491200 25 I enjoy being challenged by matching the tiles.  There are many scenes for you to clear the tiles and that is why I like it.
A13X4XT23BJ23O B00GUY712U 5 1390176000 47 I got this app for fun but it is also a great idea for kids that want to be a parent when they grow up. Even though I don't like not knowing what is inside of the egg it's a wonderful kids app. I love it!  ^_^
A13X4XT23BJ23O B00AEORXR0 3 1386374400 22 I used to love this app till they made a new update so I have a kindle fire and can't do anything!
A13X4XT23BJ23O B00BYG0RSE 5 1388188800 44 I got this for free and I love it. You should make a drawing app for frozen with the sound track, do you want to build a snow man. And maybe have clips from the movie. Maybe with a how to draw too.5 star!
A13X4XT23BJ23O B00G5LQ5MU 5 1391558400 25 I got it and the engine room is hard to pass. I like it get it. Please I'm begging you to get it. Great app.
A13X61YEVA9W6 B008BK5HJK 5 1377820800 28 However the same time as well as a result is that it was not a big deal of time to time as a result of this at all
A13X61YEVA9W6 B0073LHCCS 3 1380412800 20 This game is fun but it's too hard. You should make it easier. But other than that it is fun
A13X61YEVA9W6 B008IJT0CE 5 1380672000 22 I love this app. I always use it. In fact I use it every night! PLEASE keep me posted on new updates!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A13X61YEVA9W6 B00H59CTW6 5 1403740800 33 I love this app because it is fast at loading and it never gets old. It always has something for you to do. I love how it gives you a money bonus too!
A13X61YEVA9W6 B007PT3QOQ 1 1377561600 20 I don't like this new version at all. Your getting all these negative reviews on it, so change It back......PLEASE........NOW!!!!!!!!
A13X61YEVA9W6 B00BG3ID0Y 4 1368921600 22 I love this game. It is challenging and creative. I wish everyone can have this game. It is fun. I like it
A13X61YEVA9W6 B00EWK8N8A 5 1380153600 24 You got to get this app. You got to get this app. You got to get this app. You have to get this app
A13X61YEVA9W6 B00EZWPFW2 3 1380153600 21 This app is hard for me. I love these kinds of games but it's too hard. You should make it easier.
A13X61YEVA9W6 B00CAW96DI 5 1370131200 22 I love this game. It is challenging, fun, and sometimes annoying. I'm things of person that loves challenges so I love it
A13X8WEDMJ114O B007MC8YLQ 5 1396310400 33 This is one of my favorite games!  I play it a number of times each and every day!  It is an easy game to play and very self explanatory. I highly recommend it!
A13X8WEDMJ114O B009WJNXAE 2 1387238400 21 s they did not like what I had to say &amp; they booted me off!  I do not like this game!
A13X8WEDMJ114O B00BZ17Q8M 1 1373068800 34 I never got this app so I cannot tell you any thing about it.  I am not a big fan of slot machine games so I do not add them to my other apps.
A13X8WEDMJ114O B00A4O6NMG 2 1373068800 45 I finally had to give up and delete this app.  It kept telling me to name my monster,  but it would not let me do it.  I tried a number of times to get it to work,  but to no avail,  so I deleted it.
A13X8WEDMJ114O B00CLVQ8GG 1 1396051200 30 My game does not open up anymore since I purchased 5 packages of chips,  tickets &amp; gems. I wasted my money and now I cannot even play!!  WHAT A RIP!
A13X8WEDMJ114O B00A6GNC1M 1 1387238400 33 every time they upgrade my kindle fire freezes up and I can wait up to two months before they upgrade again to fix it.  when you are able tonplay it, it is ok.
A13X8WEDMJ114O B00CMF27DE 1 1404691200 30 THIS IS THE WORSE GAME ON MY KINDLE FIRE!  IT CONSISTENTLY BUMPS ME OFF FACE BOOK AND I HAVE TO RESIGN IN OVER AND OVER AGAIN!  NOT WORTH THE TIME!
A13X93M7A4HGW B007RQIWHI 3 1353974400 23 good game to play...... just needs more guns and better upgrades but over all i like this game i give this three stars
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B006OBWGHO 4 1355184000 19 pretty fun game I believe it should have more levels. otherwise its a pretty fun game.Go new York giants!!!!!
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B009SDHIPK 5 1354320000 38 I loved it there is no way this game could get any better, maybe accept for its controls they could use some work. I love how when you're throwing a pass you're in the helmet of the quarterback.
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B008H4MVRG 4 1356998400 31 this game is an addiction. good game for long car rides but I gotta say I thought this game would be pathetic but it turned out alrite. good job pocket gems.
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B009S980KG 4 1353542400 20 good game I just started and it seems like its worth it. really good game whwn you're bored and addictive
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B009UX2YAC 5 1360195200 27 This app is omg appofmylife.com. It is very addicting. If you like temple run and temple run 2 you will love subway surfers. Excited for the sequel
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B00D3MWW44 5 1371340800 50 I'm a 13 year old male, and playing this kind of game would probably cause me to get made fun by my peers. But I will tell you that this game is amazing. Just please come out with more levels, because I beat the first 15 in 1 day. Pleeeaaasseee!!!!!!!
A13XIUMRL1VSE9 B009GFCVNO 5 1366502400 41 This app was definitely worth the 99&cent; it cost me, because when you have over 100 baseball games on the market, you need to find one you can trust. I love it, and anyone else with a kindle fire will to.
A13XL6KF3M0JML B0088Y7YHW 1 1373241600 20 Waste of my time and very frustrating for me. I never got a bonus and the game is poor quality.
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00B63HT8Q 4 1378512000 31 One of the best weather apps I have used.My family lives all over the country. I use this constantly to check on them.I do recommend this - especially during hurricane season.
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00E0NVX4U 4 1380412800 40 I like to play this game. I think Amazon should get rid of their silly rule that you have to write a minimum of words. I think Amazon should let you download from the Google play store much better apps
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00H343YNQ 2 1390348800 98 The graphics really are well done on this app ! I enjoy playing this. The one thing I did notice that you should keep an eye on is to make sure that you are credited what you have won. There have been a few times when I didn't get my coins.I am editing my review. This game says to give them 5 stars and you will get 250,000 coins... I didn't so that is the reason for this change ! TOO BAD BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM THE  5 STARS JUST FOR THE GRAPHICS ! ! !
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00AEC8UVU 5 1394668800 28 Wow this game is very addictive ! The graphics are well done and the play is fun. I really enjoy mah jong and this is the best !
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00EQ4UF88 3 1379116800 29 I just got this game. It's too soon to tell if I like it. I am rating it early to get bonus coins. I will rate it again later.
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00FJWGHZG 5 1392336000 39 I have been playing this game for a long time. It's a bit different from the one on my cell that I got at the playstore, but still addictive and a way to pass time. I recommend this app.
A13XL6KF3M0JML B00ENTE4XS 4 1383696000 25 I enjoy the games from this developer. I have fun and I like the graphics. I wish I didn't have to type so many words.
A13XPER1KIG6OZ B004UID2LC 2 1361836800 53 I downloaded the youtube app thinking it would be similar to the youtube app on my iphone, but it is not. This app is far inferior to the iphone app. It is not user friendly, it is difficult to search for videos, and impossible to see your uploaded videos on your personal account.
A13XPL9GW5BAPY B004TTMYQG 5 1342656000 22 Best by far of several paid calendars I tried. I need excellent calendar functionality for my business and this application has it.
A13XPL9GW5BAPY B0067R8JNK 5 1362960000 34 It's Not just putting words together, but then putting the board together. I like it. Works well in my Samsung galaxy s3. No problem. Large, but understandably so considering all it needs to manage.
A13XQX0L2MWL08 B0064X7B4A 5 1362009600 59 My husband and I play this game for hours. The game is set up so you can fit it in your busy schedules. One game can last for days. We often play multiple games and fit it into our busy lives. It gives both of us an opportunity to challenge each other with out the stress of time constraints._
A13XQX0L2MWL08 B00A9JG6RS 5 1355788800 24 This is an easy going yet enjoyable game. the pace is relaxing and the target challenging. this game allows you to strategize as well.
A13XQX0L2MWL08 B00AUB8GA0 5 1362441600 56 i absolutely love this game. each puzzle is as artistic as the next. The music options are relaxing and i have repeated these puzzles over and over again. I refer to them as puzzles but they are a object serch and in most cases butterflies. This is an adult and child's game that quiets one's spirit.
A13XQX0L2MWL08 B0087TQYUG 5 1353369600 77 Fast paced word game much like the game &#34;Boggle&#34;. You make words out of connected letters during a set time. It is fast, challenges your brain, and challenges one player against the other. At first i was concerned about the coin requested to play but zynga is fair and supplies you with what you need to enjoy yourself for endless numbers of hours. just beware you might not get other things done because this game is addicting.
A13XQX0L2MWL08 B0067Q42BY 5 1329696000 22 This an addictive fun gameTHAT IS RELAXING. IT ISGOOD FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS.  I HAVE PLAYED GAMES SIMILAR BUT NONE AS RELAXINV.
A13XUC9FUM9JV6 B009WJNXAE 5 1361145600 28 I love it!I play almost every day! I am still trying to figure out though how to upgrade it on my kindle fire. On my phone no prob.
A13XVEJ7ASQFHO B00E5NH6YG 1 1394064000 51 If I had access to a TV provider, why would I want to watch it on my phone? Why do I have to have a TV provider? Deleting the app five minutes after downloading it. Guess I will wait for Season 5 of Drop Dead Diva to get put on Netflix.
A13XVEJ7ASQFHO B008IJTFYW 4 1354492800 43 I saw this randomly and downloaded it simply because it was free.  Turns out, I like it!  I used it for the first time last night and fell asleep within 20 or so minutes.  And it was a restless night before that. haha
A13XVEJ7ASQFHO B007XKEY6Q 5 1337212800 30 I have a bunch of friends who've wanted me to play this with them but it wasn't on the Fire yet. Been playing for a week now and LOVE it!!
A13XVEJ7ASQFHO B005HSL626 3 1336867200 70 While I enjoy the game, I don't appreciate the video ads that randomly pop up, especially when my kids are playing. It either makes them think they pushed something wrong or they do click and it takes them to a website.MAY buy the game later so we can play without the ads. But it ducks knowing the ads were made that annoying so that people will pay for it instead.
A13XVZCZID7QKM B00ERXVOII 5 1398729600 21 My son who is six yard old likes this game. He thinks the ball guy looks cool too. He recommends it
A13XVZCZID7QKM B008Y2FRFO 4 1398729600 32 Mindless fun. What is it about this game? It's mindless yes. But still fun when your brain has just had enough for the day. It's just like the one at the arcade.
A13XVZCZID7QKM B00AFCEIB0 4 1398729600 20 Works as intended. Able to search like any other devise. I like google to search for items and info too.
A13XVZCZID7QKM B00I0WCIMI 3 1401840000 35 Its ok, my kids think its fun but they are limited to what they can do and the full version is VERY $$$ ! I am not willing to pay that much on this game.
A13XX85QNFZE1G B005UQ9FNC 5 1330041600 27 This is the best app in the world it is addicting even my 54 yr old grandma likes it lol it is so fun to play with
A13XX85QNFZE1G B00BMH4GQE 4 1365724800 37 some of the questions are really hard so i kept resetting the game that brings me to the point that you can reset the game whenever you want but you losr the cions you have :( :)
A13XX85QNFZE1G B00CJ95O2E 5 1384646400 30 i love this app it is really usefull and it tells me how much time i have left to play or read and how much the battery is full rcomended
A13XZK499Z9TJA B00COVCV50 5 1381708800 23 it is what it is and is very fun to play and use I enjoy playing it a lot and its very fun
A13XZK499Z9TJA B0063GSL60 5 1339027200 26 it works so well on my kindle fire I enjoy it very much it works flawlessly and is a very fun thing to play when bored
A13Y0XCG6V06ZG B005XQLBU4 5 1326758400 35 Running on HTC EVO 4G 2.3.3. Works perfectly. Better than Atari's recreation. Fun, entertaining, and challenging. I got as FAOTD, don't know what they're asking for it, but if it's $. 99 it's worth it.
A13Y0XCG6V06ZG B007TKT2SK 5 1369008000 51 It does what it says it will do in a clean and functional design. I know some have mentioned the lack of a couple features. I like it in it's current form, but some of the suggestions mentioned hold merit and I can see how they could add to it. Imho
A13Y0XCG6V06ZG B0055S348W 4 1323907200 37 It works on my HTC EVO 4G and love it. The only thing I would like to see is the ability to print from my Mail app other than just Gmail. Then it would be 5 stars!
A13Y23RPP0GG8U B007JYI4SU 1 1338422400 29 I downloaded just to see what it would do. Turns out it doesn't match my mood, ever. I'm gpong to remove the app just haven't gotten to it yet.
A13Y23RPP0GG8U B004K4RY9M 3 1338422400 31 I enjoy word search at the end of my day. I sit in my favorite chair and pick-up my kindle and turn to word search and forget about everything for awhile.
A13Y452RWY7SED B0055SWM08 3 1362528000 37 It is a little fun. I finished the levels but I'm not going to replay them all so I feel like it isn't a very good game if you want something you can play over and over.
A13Y452RWY7SED B00B6PO6AI 4 1367366400 26 This game looks very fun and I have enjoyed playing it so far. Do you go up in levels our is our just one continuous level?
A13Y452RWY7SED B006OBWGHO 1 1356480000 28 I didn't like it and I deleted it after a few times of playing it. Boring. I thought the game lacked the "fun" factor and was too mindless
A13Y5GNTESV6JG B0089Z3D02 3 1386633600 34 I LOVE PLAYING GAMES, BUT I HATE THAT I HAVE TO LOG-IN!!  I ALWAYS FORGET MY PASSWORD!!!  IS THERE ANY WAY TO GET AROUND THIS ISSUE, AS I HAVE TOO MANY PASSWORDS TO REMEMBER?
A13Y5GNTESV6JG B00BHHIWQO 5 1386633600 20 I LOVE A GAME THAT CHALLENGE!!  I PLAY THIS GAME DAILY, SEVERAL TIMES A DAY!!  I LOVE BEATING MY FRIENDS!!!
A13Y5GNTESV6JG B008LY1B32 5 1386633600 29 DOMINOES, DOMINOES, DOMINOS!!!  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS GAME!!!  THIS IS MY FAVORITE PASTIME....ON THE COMPUTER, MY ANDROID, MY KINDLE, PLAYING WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS AT GET-TOGETHERS, ETC!!!
A13Y5GNTESV6JG B00B7KKNI6 3 1386633600 23 I LIKE THE CHALLENGE OF THE GAME, BUT I HATE PLAYING AGAINST FRIENDS....IT TAKES TO LONG FOR A RESPONSE!  I LOOSE INTEREST WAITING!!!
A13Y5GNTESV6JG B00FAPF5U0 5 1386633600 20 I LOVE THE CHALLENGE!!  BUT, I MUST SAY, A FEW OF THE STAGES ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.  BUT, I'M STILL PLAYING!!!
A13Y7BSRHHJQCF B00IAQ3RJM 4 1402272000 32 This game is so much fun and really quick. But stop with the Facebook.I love the game, but will not use Facebook. The rewards are the best of any game I've played.
A13Y7BSRHHJQCF B00H343YNQ 5 1395532800 50 This is how all games should be designed. Great animation, I love the poodle dancing. Great color, sound and payouts. I have tried almost all of the games, but a few games don't play, I just get a black screen.Overall this is a 5 and great entertainment. My new favorite.
A13Y8N01A1CFZZ B006OCM13M 5 1402185600 48 This is a good game for any age. If you feel the need to have a chocolate cake or anything else... this is the REAL DEAL. But nothing.. I mean NOTHING is BETTER then my moms MAC AND CHEESE. SO DONT GET IN MY WAY!!! WATCH IT HON!!!!!!!!
A13Y8N01A1CFZZ B00D3MWW44 5 1396742400 39 RI think this game is soooooo....... fun. Because you can earn money really fast and you can get amazing dolphin's. If you don't have this game take it from me please get it you will toatlly not be SORRY

A13YBMTBFFQ88E B008CFVG58 4 1343865600 25 I wish it was easier to get the Garfield points.  To get a lot you have to buy some.  Its kinds fun and addicting though
A13YBMTBFFQ88E B0063IH60K 5 1389830400 21 It works well with no problems.  It's simplicity makes it my favorite game.  I am not having any problem with ads.
A13YBMTBFFQ88E B00FIW5BZE 5 1391644800 25 I really like this app.  The backgrounds make this more interesting and exciting.  The background music is calming and peaceful and the tiles are beautiful.
A13YFHYIOKK98B B009G9KFQ0 1 1402876800 22 Couldn't utilitzie this on my kindle so I deleted it. I tried several times and nothing would come up on the screen.
A13YFHYIOKK98B B008R9OIUO 2 1402876800 61 I know Hidden Object games are suppose to be challenging but some are to hard because the items on some screens aren't even visbile enough to even &#34;think&#34; they might be the item you are looking for. I enjoy searching for items but some of these games are too hard for someone whol plays these types of games all the time.
A13YFHYIOKK98B B00FB13Y74 3 1389139200 37 This game is OK but it is too fast for me! You have to move quickly and that is hard for me to do but there are probably people who can play this better then I can.
A13YFHYIOKK98B B00KGCNRAM 3 1402876800 26 I really like this game I enjoy playing all types of Mahjong games.It is fun and really makes you think because some blockes are so similiar.
A13YFHYIOKK98B B0063GSL60 4 1388275200 20 I never played this particular Solitaire game before a little harder than ones I played but I really like it.
A13YFLH2PUWKHH B00C7TAF3Y 4 1401667200 282 I like puzzle games, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I opened the game, thinking I'd play for a few minutes and move on to some household chores...right! I found it difficult to put down my kindle until I'd solved the riddle.. After my husband and my daughter discovered what I was so absorbed with, they wanted to play as well.The game is a brain teaser. You have to figure out how to open the safe that is presented in the beginning of the game. You hunt for clues and attempt to solve the riddles presented. Each object you uncover fits somewhere into the puzzle of opening the safe. The game is really fun and challenging while it lasts. The problem is that it is over too soon. Once you solve the riddle, the game is over for you. The good thing is that it is a relatively inexpensive game at 99 cents. I took away a star due to that limitation.The graphics are nice and the game does a good job of teaching you how to play while you are actually playing. The music is a bit creepy and annoying, but that is easily fixed by turning down the volume on your tablet. There is a second game  by this developer and it appears to add further chapters to the ones in this game. I haven't had a chance to play it yet, so I will reserve judgment on that one. It is a great activity for kids, as it forces them to think logically and in a step-wise manner--great for teenagers. I would highly recommend this game and look forward to many more games from this developer.
A13YHDIX61NEFU B00G357N92 4 1390953600 28 So far so good for a time killer. Game play is easy and along the lines of cooking dash so easy to enjoy if you like those games.
A13YHDIX61NEFU B007PT3QOQ 5 1351814400 24 I grew up on the original Oregon Settler and I have to say that I'm loving this version just as much as the original.
A13YHDIX61NEFU B006E51AZY 4 1392854400 53 This game is much like the dash games (diner dash, cooking dash, etc.) and is a good time waster. I enjoy it, levels steadily get harder but are not extremely difficult and once you pay for the full game you don't have to pay for anything else, which is an added bonus. :)
A13YHDIX61NEFU B00B3WD78Q 4 1392508800 28 Haven't played it that much but not a bad time sucker. Good if you don't wan't to get too involved in something but need to pass the time
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B00992CF6W 5 1353628800 40 This app is amazing. When I first got it, no grass, no glowstone, and other stuff. When I did not play it for a while, it gave me that stuff that was missing like grass and goldstone. I &lt;3 Minecraft!
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B0064DBE9I 5 1352505600 37 I love this app it is awesome.For kids and adults.I downloaded this app and I couldn't stop playing the piano and I still can't. GET THIS APP NOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT!LISTEN TO THE CRAZY PERSON
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B009ZKSPDK 5 1359244800 74 better than minecraft pe! you have 6 pages of stuff you can spawn stuff and make electricity and use everything like u can use the furnace in static mode and u can use the crafting table u can eat stuff and it gives u raw bacon and bird and cooked bacon and bird .I highly recommend this app. U can choose wat u want ur land is supposed to look like. AWESOME GIRL OUT!
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B00B7Y0206 5 1371340800 49 it has better video viewing than youtube. it has categories. I love skydoesminecraft but I cant watch his vids on youtube cause it always exits out of the vid (I have a kindle fire) .now I can finally watch skydoesminecraft vids on my kindle fire. thx for your time!
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B00CTXY8RC 1 1377216000 34 it is exactly like another app Solverlabs has except it has a different name and is $1 more than worldcraft another app they made. if you want to spend less money than get worldcraft.
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B004JOSUMI 5 1357257600 25 this app is great I can get everything free!!! I got some nights by fun and it sounds great!!! get it this app is awesome!
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B00BXTTRO2 1 1382400000 78 I tried this app a couple months ago on my phone. I did mods and patches and stuff like that. When I saw it for kindle fire on my appstore, I said I would get it so I could do mods. Then, as soon as I went on it for the first time, it said that it detected a recent crash and W's on safe mode. then, every time I went on it, it crashed.I HATE THIS APP!!!!!!!!
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B0079Q963K 4 1355961600 26 I luv it but I wish u did not need wifi for it.I think u should not need wifi for it.I think this should be fixed.
A13YKUFFKCW3AN B00A0YXZVW 5 1356739200 32 get this app I love it but be careful it lets you purchase digital content using real money but its awesome GET IT NOW GET IT NOW ITS FREE GET IT NOW
A13YLLHSXI78T9 B005TBWN0K 1 1330041600 31 don't get this its a peace of crap.glad it was free.I reccomond drawer.horrible on fire you cant do a lot since there is no camera I really wanted to try it.

A13YLLHSXI78T9 B004T2QZL8 5 1332288000 20 good. need kid safe mode for kids great I love update it and you wont have the force close problem.
A13YLLHSXI78T9 B0069G5Z9K 5 1345507200 20 my brother has this on his I pod touch and ive played it so I am so happy its here
A13YNEA1QVASH1 B009G9KFQ0 5 1405296000 30 This app is great and it shows better than the weather channel. U can get weather notices quicker than the weather channel. Never would have guessed how great it is.
A13YNEA1QVASH1 B00594XOZU 5 1393718400 27 People say it does not work but they must be stupid or something because me while family has it too. And it's works like a charm!!!!!! :p
A13YNVX3PAQ088 B00FGFVMGA 5 1385942400 20 cute game with helpful hints.  wish it were longer.  no permissions required which is the way some apps should be.
A13YNVX3PAQ088 B008L3T37O 1 1355875200 85 i thought fairies would be cute, but this app was a huge waste.  the saturated color tone for each level is annoying.  not being able to zoom in, i ended up just randomly clicking around.  it would have been nice to be able to save or go back to a specific level.  a couple times, i accidently clicked on End Game instead of Resume and had to start all over again.  but the game pretty much ended in about an hour so i'm deleting it.
A13YNVX3PAQ088 B008IJT0CE 5 1385942400 20 i've enjoyed this app and all the sound options.  i like the sleep option where it times off.  very relaxing.
A13YQWB3K6QO3D B00BG3ID0Y 4 1362182400 25 I like this one better than some of the others! It doesn't freeze up &amp; all the pic have something to do w/ the word!
A13YQWB3K6QO3D B008JK6W5K 5 1360713600 25 I enjoy this game. I cant put it down until I figure them all out. Some are easy and others I never heard of b4!!
A13YQWB3K6QO3D B00BMH4GQE 5 1363046400 34 this is easy @ 1st then the longer u play the harder it gets. you get the hard one right then they bring on the easy ones just too keep u playing!! love it
A13YQWB3K6QO3D B00CAW96DI 4 1367798400 26 I haven't played much but so far it fun. Takes a lot of common senses to get the answers. just try it and see for yourself.
A13YRUM4XOLQQS B0088QDDDY 4 1348617600 35 The game is indeed short, but the overall game play can bring back excellent memories of 8 bit video game gold.  is it worth a buck to play a short but well made game?  Yes.
A13YRUM4XOLQQS B004N8R576 4 1313193600 119 The game does work on the EVO 4G, but I had to do this simple process.  After it FC on me, I restarted the phone.  Upon starting the game up again, I pushed the back arrow key on the phone when the front screen started.  Presto!  The home screen started up and I&apos;ve had no further problems.  \n\nGameplay:  The game is simple by &quot;flicking&quot; the ball into the net.  There are multiple game styles and I&apos;ve primarily  been playing arcade.  I give the game play four stars and it is a great time waste if you are on bus, plane or enduring a long car ride.  Give it a go if you have an EVO as it is enjoyable.
A13YRUM4XOLQQS B004FOA84A 4 1303344000 44 The game does work on my HTC EVO.  I had to shut it down and restart it to end the force close.  now it loads and plays with no problems.  maybe it is a minor glitch that needs to be fixed by the developer.
A13YUQCIJU0Y54 B009HKL4B8 3 1357171200 61 I really don't play this much due to the whole &#34;real time&#34; factor. The time it takes for your Sim to get unhappy is no where near the time it takes to satisfy their needs! Its aggravating. This one step forward, two steps back makes its hard to stay interested in the game for very long. I'll stick to my SimCity.
A13YUQCIJU0Y54 B00F7YHDWC 5 1381881600 45 Once you get the motions down, this game is super fun and easy. My neighbor's kids absolutely love it and have tourneys whenever I bring out my Kindle Fire.**Note, Kindle Fire Users, you can turn off the &#34;Blow Airplane&#34; game by using the settings menu.**
A13YUQCIJU0Y54 B0085YNML2 5 1357171200 47 The game is a real challenge, its not like you can just zoom through all the levels and be done. You have to stop and think about the order of the flowers. I like that. Not all the levels require hard thought and thats a good balance.
A13YUQCIJU0Y54 B00BWBHIUG 1 1391126400 37 I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire and it wouldn't even let me connect to the server! After several attempts, the game crashed. I deleted it after an hour of trying... I want my time back. :(
A13YUQCIJU0Y54 B00ABGFFOO 2 1363478400 33 I'll make a few cones and then it crashes. Besides that, its an okay app. Not something you'll keep for months and months. Its more of something you'll delete after a couple hours.
A13YV0J9C6WCD3 B00I8Q77Y0 4 1391904000 26 I love this game so much but my high score is 1. So you should get this app but beware it is so hard to do.
A13YV0J9C6WCD3 B008K8VDPU 5 1387843200 23 I &lt;3 THIS APP CAN U TELL I LOVE THIS APP U SHOULD TELL CAUSE IM YELLING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!lots of different things to enjoy ;)
A13YV0J9C6WCD3 B00DUGCLY4 5 1376352000 21 i love this app so much it is amazing I love the riddles and how challeinging it all is so coolio
A13YV0J9C6WCD3 B005ZFOOE8 5 1388793600 24 OMG soooooooo awesome love all the great songs listening to timber right now OMGlove it so much it is sure to posse many people
A13YV0J9C6WCD3 B00846GKTW 5 1395619200 24 I absolutely love this game except you have to spend your money on the game that you got on the game for energy drinks.
A13YVJ64W0AT5F B00DYY92MG 3 1381104000 24 Great game until you do not know the answer. Do not like how you have to obtain clues especially having to ask Facebook friends.
A13YVJ64W0AT5F B005LVLJP8 2 1380067200 20 Did not like the design. It was difficult to figure out how to play this favorite spades game.  Needs work.
A13YVJ64W0AT5F B007NZV2HK 2 1388966400 20 Fairly fun. I like the way it shows when you have completed a word. Great word search to relax with.
A13YVJ64W0AT5F B008Y31CXE 4 1380067200 48 Really enjoying this note pad.  I can jot down things I want to do, or remember for a day, week or month then delete them as they are completed. Great for the person who has trouble remembering events, or just want to make a note on things observed.
A13YVJ64W0AT5F B00COVCV50 3 1381104000 38 Ok. Just do not like it when you don't know the answer you have to buy letters or words. There should be some other means to obtain clues, and NOT going on Facebook to ask for help either!
A13YVJ64W0AT5F B00ANH526W 2 1402531200 21 Campus Life is a little difficult to get around and figure out the characters and how to add and place furniture.

A13YX2Y8L48S5D B00881VLCE 5 1403568000 53 If you enjoy puzzles this is great. The pictures are beautiful and you can adjust the difficulty of it. I highly recommend it. I haven't done puzzles in years because of the room they take up, but this app allows you to work on it then leave, no mess left behind! Wonderful !
A13YX2Y8L48S5D B00E8KLWB4 3 1398038400 42 I have only been playing for a few hours, but I am enjoying the game so far.  I think if might take a lot of memory because the update took a long time to load.  That is the reason for 3 stars.
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B008MEM24S 5 1342656000 135 Another hit by Disney. Lots more ways to make your mind think and problem solve in a fun way. There is fire- ice-mud-lasers and lots of other things to contend with to get Perry to his next assignment. Adults as well as children will enjoy this app. although younger kids will find the upper levels difficult...I know I did...and trust me I'm no kid. If you like using your brain then you will love &quot;Where's my Perry&quot;...also check out what Swampy and Crabby are up to in-Disney's Where's my water? for hours of fun...and some frustration...but you will feel so clever when you figure a level out that you have been working on for a while...hey-you might even throw yourself a party...ok I went a little overboard...no party..but for 99 cents ya can't beat it.
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B00BEPVAV8 5 1363392000 262 I don't like racing games - I mean I REALLY don't like them - I'm more of a puzzle person - but I remembered being in an arcade in NYC with my Dad racing dune buggies against each other, eating Nathan's hotdogs, walking along Broadway and having a great time... so for old time sake I checked out this FREE app. not expecting much - Well...Surprise! Surprise! This has now become one of my favorite games. The graphics are second to none-the music is upbeat but not annoying, in fact the music goes perfectly with the game and the controls work brilliantly with the Kindle Fire. I love the fact that I can use tilt or touch control. I like tilt because it feels more like I'm using a steering wheel. I use my thumbs for the brakes. There are all sorts of really fun power-ups that you earn by picking up coins during your drive/race. I also like the fact that if I hit something the game doesn't stop -instead the thing that I hit breaks apart...there are also all kinds of upgrades you can buy with the coins you earn ( (no need to spend real cash - a BIG plus)- for instanced ...new dune buggies - new drivers and sooo much more. As a matter of fact there is sooo much going on in this game (without it being overwhelming) that it would take me too long to name them all...besides, discovery is half the fun, yes? Glad we agree. :-)....Hope this review has been helpful to you. Rainbows
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B009RLG7RI 5 1362614400 72 Nice graphics - good music - interesting storyline - love the narrator's voice - I really like building the village...and at no point do you need real money to buy items for your village ...my only problem is that I am not a big fan of &quot;match 3 games &quot;but anyone who likes playing those types of games will get a kick out of this app...it works great on the Kindle Fire.
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B005ZXWMUS 5 1340236800 352 I love Netflix on my TV-computer and now on my Kindle Fire as well. I almost didn't download it because of all the bad reviews I read. I'm very happy I decided to test it out for myself. When I'm watching a movie I plug my kindle fire in using an extension cord so that I can watch movies or TV programs anywhere I want to including my front and backyards...this way I don't have to worry about battery power. I also have a very strong internet connection which I'm sure helps as well as having a full battery when I use Netflix. Buffering is normal when you are streaming a movie-dont get impatient-just let it do its thing.  I have watched 9 movies so far...7 of them were perfect...1 of them buffered twice instead of once...and one movie (a cartoon) kept getting stuck at the same exact spot so I fast forwarded past the spot and it played the rest of the cartoon just fine. I haven't had any sync problems and the picture quality is very nice indeed...not HD quality...but still very good. I find the best way to listen to the movie audio is to wear a headset because the sound can get drowned out if there is a lot going on at your home...dogs barking...kids playing etc. However I like to wear a headset with just one ear piece so I can hear the phone ring or if someone needs to speak to me. With the earpiece you may want to lower your volume because it can get quite loud especially when you are watching action movies and or any kind of music video. Also I read that some folks thought Netflix was FREE...just the app. is free...to watch all the movies/TV you could possibly want-you ONLY have to pay $7.99 a month...that's pretty darn close to free considering what you get. And don't forget-once you have your Netflix membership you can watch your shows on your home computer-your laptop-your tv-or any device that will support Netflix...like the Kindle Fire...all for one price. Ya can't beat it-Great App!
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B008QZ1ZYQ 5 1346544000 134 Love this game-It's really clever and let's you use your brain...but in a relaxing way...not like some games where everything is rush rush rush. This game let's  you take the time to think about what to do.  You make a move- then the spiders make a move...but it's  not a slow game either...it's  just right! I found myself laughing out loud when the spiders got the bug. I'm having more fun with it than I thought possible with an game app...and it was free!...I would have spent money on it easy...and btw...it's  also cute as heck and as the levels get harder they give you things to defeat the spiders...for instance-you can freeze them or use scissors to cut the web...Now excuse me while I get back to my poor scared little  bugs...Mrs. Rick
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B006D1ONE4 5 1341705600 328 I pride myself in being a fairly intelligent person. I ran a TV studio and started my own business...so when I heard about this game with an alligator in the sewers that needed water to take a shower I just shook my head...then I read that this alligator (Swampy) wanted the person playing the game to be the one to get this water for him...I then laughed myself silly. But now I think I must be a little nuts because I find myself playing it at least an hour a day. It's more than just a mindless game because it really makes you think and problem solve...you laugh a lot too. A couple of useful tips for you folks just beginning...Get the silly duckies or you won't be able to open up other levels. I had to go back and replay games to get them because I thought " Hey this is easier if I dont get the ducks." Big mistake on my part. It makes the game much more challenging and much more thought provoking...and fun. Secondly...find the hidden items that are under the "walls"...Yes-I had to go back and replay games to find them. Best way to do it is to "knock" down all the walls first so that you know where the idem is and then start the game over so its easy to locate...Is that cheating?...Quick someone call the alligator police on me!! And lastly just for fun learn one of the harder games in a level so that you can solve it really quickly...and then ask someone who prides themself in being intelligent to solve it...of course they will sit there for at least 15 minutes or maybe even longer (they might even give up)...and than clever person that you are...you solve it in 20 seconds...I think that's cheating too but it's  a lot of fun...just like this game...and besides...for 99 cents you really can't go wrong. (Say hi to Swampy for me.)
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B008OOYALE 1 1362182400 280 I started playing this game and was really enjoying it-so much so that I actually put down some real money to buy some gold-but after a while I began to notice that there were many, many,  many, things that my "neighbors" could do that I could not. They could buy and/or breed dragons that I didn't have the option too because they weren't even in my "marketplace" to buy - neither are tons of the decorations and some of the habitats ...and without the right color habitat there isn't anywhere to put certain dragons even if those dragons were in my "marketplace." I also can't do even 1/10th of the goals that non-Kindle users can do. I e-mailed TeamLava about the problem and they wrote back " We at TeamLava are sorry for the inconvenience but some devices (such as the Kindle Fire) cannot get the full version of our app. Dragon Story. We hope to upgrade our software very soon. Thank you for your patience."-Well I have been patient ...I WORKED MY WAY UP TO LEVEL 72!!!...(There are only 100 levels) ...and now this game has become boring-boring-boring and repetitive because I don't  have the full game. It would have been nice if TeamLava would have told all the Kindle users out there that their app wasn't  compatible with the Kindle BEFORE we got into the game...and "yes " I feel like a dope for spending real cash on a game that's  not complete...but I guess that's what TeamLava was hoping for...get the cash and then let the dope find another game. Shame on you TeamLava for not being honest from the beginning...So to sum this up...KINDLE USERS BEWARE!!!
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B00FAX6XQC 1 1384041600 109 My friend had this on his Kindle and it took up so much memory that he had to delete a bunch of other apps to make it work. We played it for about 5 minutes and then it froze up...not once but twice. It made his Kindle so slow and sluggish that he finally took it off his Kindle and then everything went back to normal...So why isn't my friend writing this review?...He doesn't like writing bad reviews but I think they are important so that other people don't have to go through the same aggravation . Oh and by the way...this game is also one GIANT money pit.
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B00820STKI 2 1339718400 156 I like an app. just to fool around with while I'm killing time just as much as the next guy. But this app. is geared toward a child because it couldn't hold my interest for more than 30 seconds. I tried all the games too...same thing. The graphics are done very well ando/ deserve a star. If you have children under 10 years old I think they they will get a kick out of this app. and it will keep them entertain for a while on a long car trip...so it gets a star for that too. My guess is that a few adults will disagree with me and that's fine because we all have different tastes but this adult is deleting this app. and going to go park some make believe airplanes in my make believe airport. See? I DO like to have some mindless fun. Sorry I didn't like this one...I really wanted to.
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B00G5LQ5MU 5 1390089600 45 Really makes your mind work...sometimes it even makes it work over-time. The sight and sound of this app. is amazing...very well done. I look forward to hours of fun with it. Got to go-I need to go find &quot;Rose&quot; and get off this sinking ship!
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B008N8IV2U 5 1344643200 243 This is one of the few game apps. that really challenges your brain. You have to figure out what will make the elevator doors open...from moving a plant to finding the right numbers to turning your device upside down to playing the correct notes on a piano...and those are the easy ones. I didn't mind the fact that it didn't come with instructions or any written hints because in fact there are hints...but you have to look very carefully at the whole picture to figure them out and try a lot of different things-especially on the upper floors. If you are looking for a "quick fix" or haven't much patience than this game isn't for you...there is a guide out now that gives you all the answers but really what the heck fun is that?! I find it very satisfying when I finally figure out how to get those damn doors to open. There have been a few that I spent hours and hours on and a few that I got in 30 seconds ( there was one floor that I have no clue how I opened the doors) but some of them you can open within an hour of working your brain muscles...as long as there aren't any screaming children. So have fun and may the force be with you. ( Can you tell I'm working on the floor with the UFO and E.T.?)...GREAT GAME!...BTW...The graphics are wonderful on the Kindle Fire.
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B007U8JRWW 5 1339718400 148 I couldn't believe it when I found not one but three cameras set up in my favorite vacation spot-The Wildwood Boardwalk in New Jersey. &quot; Watch the tram car please! &quot; I love the bird cam's and nests. One of my favs is a bar on the other side of the world. Some of the scenery cam's are really beautiful-like the one in Hawaii. Watching folks in Russia &amp; other parts of the world go about their daily lives is really interesting not to mention the close up cam's of the single benches in parks and other places. Oh and I almost forgot I found a cam set up by the waterfront where I used to live-that alone made it well worth the 99 cents. But don't take my word on it try-this app. for yourself-you won't be sorry. Did I say I love it? YES I do!
A13Z0BLEZG1D31 B007VUA7VO 5 1347494400 102 Listen to the raves from all the reviewers because they are all true. I won't  go into how the app. works etc. because it's already been said many times over here in the reviews. I will say it is so so so easy to use. I love having the option of a &quot;voice&quot; tell me my battery level. (You get to choose  the level you will be told at) and so much morethe grapics are wonderful-works great on my Kindle Fire. I don't  mind the ads but I will buy the pro verison just to support the creator of this app...Perfect Job!d
A13Z5KI2T19F0F B00HDRTGDK 5 1392595200 43 I haven't thought about a lot of these things for a long time, it was fun to go back in time.  But my brain kept blanking out.  You will have fun and work you're brain at the same time.  It's good for you!!!
A13Z5KI2T19F0F B00IAQ3RJM 5 1393977600 46 I have just started playing Monster Busters and I'm glad that I found the game.  From the other reviews that I read I know it will be more and more fun as I go along.  Give this one a try you won't be sorry.  ENJOY !!!
A13Z5KI2T19F0F B004HE5TAG 5 1396137600 62 I've been playing blackjack for awhile and have really been enjoying it a lot, give this one a try, I think ..who'll see it's a lot of fun.  You just won't know until you give it a try, so try it today, you won't be sorry.Have a great time and let us all, know what you think of this great game.Linda Bronson
A13Z9NU9AGHOPO B006C1ZSO4 2 1326240000 53 It is what they said so the 2 Star rating doesn't relate to their description of the app. Its just a mindless little diversion not meant for anyone above 5yrs old. I think sometimes I've stared at the screen too long when I start downloading stupid things like this :-) [[ASIN:B006C1ZSO4 Finger Slayer]
A13Z9NU9AGHOPO B004SVMNXY 2 1356998400 28 Initially interesting to begin with, but loses it's charm very quickly. Even my 4yr old grandson hands my phone right back to me when I bring this up.
A13Z9NU9AGHOPO B0085PEG16 4 1354665600 45 It can be an interesting pastime verses all the car racing and animal games. Also the missions will seem & sound familiar for anyone who has watched any form of Star Trek, and who hasn't seen that series at some point in it's development. :-)
A13Z9NU9AGHOPO B0064DBE9I 5 1335052800 37 I wish I had more time to learn a real instrument. This is a nice way to share a tune with my grandson and he loves trying to follow the keys as they light up!Little Piano (Free)
A13Z9NU9AGHOPO B007V4X5MS 5 1356912000 80 This is a very nicely done application. Has many things for the little one to do and they don't even realize your teaching them something. You can save the artwork for another day or erase and do over. My 4yr old grandson stopped playing his XBox today when I let him notice me fiddling around with this on my phone. I don't have a Tablet, but if I did this app I'm sure would go from Good to Great!Alphabet Coloring
A13Z9NU9AGHOPO B004DLPXAO 5 1326240000 49 My phone already came with a Reader app that works just fine. A friend recommended this one and it is very nice. It works effortlessly and is a very elegant read. Now I have 2. If only I can now find the time to read something :-)Kindle for Android
A13ZAPV1GTLW9T B00E7VV2RS 3 1384041600 28 So far the game is fun it's early that's why I give it three stars will have to see how it develops to see if it's worth more.
A13ZD31GURIK2U B006OP8494 5 1369180800 27 This is awesome! I can now have my scriptures with me at all times. I love my traditional scriptures for church, but these are great to have.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B007VT07QU 5 1354320000 27 This is one of the best hidden object games out there. I had some problems at first, but after I fully understood the game I love it.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B0067Q4DPE 5 1365379200 21 I love playing both of these games. I found it well worth downloading both Mahjong Artifacts Games. I highly recommend them.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B004FOA84A 5 1365379200 41 I loved this application. This game was terrific. The only down side, is once you have finished and find the secret of Grisly Manor, it is all over with. It would be great if they could update this with new adventures.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B006N0Q3TS 5 1365379200 30 I have since deleted this game from my tablet. Not because I did not like it, but because I have a limited amount of memory and never really played it.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B004SRNH10 5 1365379200 25 I find this one of many applications that are needed to play and run your games and apps, both on my tablet and my computers.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B004X80QNG 5 1365379200 41 I apologize. I do not remember this application. Evidently, I have deleted it from my tablet. I am still giving it a 5 star rating though. Sometimes, I just delete application which I do not use or have too much memory.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B00702PZME 5 1365379200 24 I have since deleted this application. Not because I did not like it, but because I did not have enough room on my tablet.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B007ZD17XO 5 1354320000 24 If you love Treasures of Montezuma, and Treasures of Montezuma 2, you will absolutely love Treasures of Montezuma 3. It is an awesome game.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B0067Q42BY 5 1365379200 31 I found the free version to be very inviting, so I decided to purchase the more advanced game. I hate to pay for games, but found it well worth the fee.
A13ZE9XWRQPPYC B007A2IOOU 5 1354320000 23 This game rocks. At first I was a little confused on how to go about playing, but once I understood I was hooked.
A13ZENZYPYFPA9 B00AKL1XPU 5 1368230400 25 This is a great game to pass the time with. It's easy enough that even my 5yr old can play and collect coins for me.
A13ZENZYPYFPA9 B008IJTFYW 5 1369094400 67 This app has definitely gotten lots of use in my household. You see i am in the army and living in the middle of the desert, where i am from you can hear crickets and night life. Well this app has that and I have slept so peacefully listening to the night and thunder selections. I would have never thought a free app would be this great.
A13ZENZYPYFPA9 B009ZZDNT6 5 1367107200 24 Simple to use, and I like the fact that it includes the weather. I also like there are different tones to wake up to.
A13ZJ5XNZWBWQX B00G4FAU14 4 1404604800 20 I ALWAYS WIN!!!!!!!!!! I AM PRETTY SURE THE RIGGED THIS FOR ME. PLUS this IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Agree with me k.
A13ZJ5XNZWBWQX B00AMR1HZ8 5 1385337600 33 I love the game and I always win,but never won the $1,000,000 wedge. Although,PLEASE bring back the $10,000 wedge it was my favorite since I was little. PLEASE bring the $10,000 wedge. PLEASE?
A13ZJ5XNZWBWQX B00DRPVE3M 1 1381017600 31 When someone plays a draw four on me I say yes cause I have a card that matches the previous card  it it says fail. I want a lawsuit of $1,000,000!
A13ZKUNI49R0YT B0091REZMW 4 1357344000 24 Good game,  plenty to do.  Only problem,  to repetitive on the items to find in the same room.  Could have used other items too.
A13ZKUNI49R0YT B00AIQP9DE 5 1357430400 21 great game_nuf said.  loved the storyline. creepy music. mystery made me want to keep playing. no matter what time it was
A13ZN9S34G5Y23 B007PTJOV0 5 1337990400 24 This is one of the greatest games on the aneroid ever. reminds me of super Mario brothers games from when I was a kid
A13ZN9S34G5Y23 B0091REZMW 5 1366243200 29 This game is more than just a hidden puzzle game. It requires strategies and cunning to excel at it. This game is worth the time to download and okay.
A13ZN9S34G5Y23 B0054JZC6E 5 1331596800 35 This app is a great way to stay entertained. You can play for hours yourself or let the kids play while your sitting in a waiting room or while your out running errands. Its wonderful.
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B006P2Y2QK 5 1359331200 23 Look if your at a doctors appointment or any appointment and they have you waiting, this is the app to have, enough said!
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B007BTE2F2 5 1359331200 56 Got this app so I could show my wife where she had hurt her bad after she had an MRI. Found the app to be better than a lot I've seen that cost a hold lot. It was very helpful and I learned a lot more about how the inside of our body's look and work.
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B00A4KVFLY 4 1359331200 31 Here we go again this is another app that my wife loves and plays a lot. I've seen her play this sometimes three hours and that works for me, game on!
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B004TI2ZXY 4 1359331200 46 I've been using map quest for about 10 year and it very helpful now days if you need a hard copy of where your going. I do have a tracking GPS system but I still do a hard copy just in case my GPS looses power.
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B0064X7FVE 5 1359331200 38 The Weather Channel app from amazon is a must have app works well on my kindle Fire and Look great too. Start your day knowing that this app get the job done as far as the weather go's.
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B00BNH81FU 4 1398297600 20 Good app lots of good recipes and meets my need, but I was really looking for the Betty Crocker app.
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B004SOR4H6 5 1359331200 35 Another wonderful and great app on amazon - Twitter, I use it like it looks great on my Kindle Fire HD. Nothing to think about just get it and it will get you! :D LOL
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B007ZGO7EM 5 1359331200 33 When go my Kindle Fire didn't see a calculator that I could use while doing our budget, I checked at amazon app store and found this great one and use it a lot.
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B006DJ2JSI 4 1359331200 47 I got this app because sometimes I'm not a get speller, so this app come in handy. I like it a lot but the one on my iphone seem to be a little better because it dose a lot more. But over all it's a great app!
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B004MC8CA2 5 1359417600 31 Wonderful bible app for reading god's word plus posting daily verses to facebook each morning. Wondering could I uses this in church, hey it's not a cell phone, just thinking :-)
A13ZRIN3TRIFZH B008CPZNL6 5 1359331200 47 Another great app that I use on my iphone and now I'm using it on my Kindle Fire HD. This is more than a new app it's what I call an everything app, it has it all. Just get it you will love it, I sure do!!!
A13ZU4NZGK7EL2 B005ZXWMUS 5 1329350400 34 After this last update I have no complaints about this app.  Videos can now be watched on full screen minus the bar at the bottom.  The picture quality on my kindle fire is awesome!!
A13ZU4NZGK7EL2 B00C5U3FS2 5 1370995200 30 Love this game. Super fun and super silly. If you love trivia and pop culture this is the game  for you.  It works really well on my Kindle Fire HD.
A13ZU4NZGK7EL2 B004KAL2BC 5 1329091200 20 Great twitter app...totally worth paying for. I love that I can also post to facebook. Works great on kindle fire.
A13ZU4NZGK7EL2 B00AW3FDIO 4 1375747200 23 Super fun game once you get the hang of the controls. I see my self wasting a lot of time on this one.
A13ZVMQR2DT73W B0061S073A 5 1388275200 27 This app. keeps kids from temptation to go wandering on the internet.  Do not put temptation in their way.  Keep them safe and have peace of mind.
A13ZVMQR2DT73W B0063IH60K 5 1388275200 31 Free app. that I use to pass time when I am waiting for time to pass and do not want to get involved in anything I need to think deeply about.
A13ZVMQR2DT73W B0066T8SDU 5 1388275200 25 I only play against the computer and find it very challenging.  You can pick skill levels, number of opponents.  Another way to exercise your brain.
A13ZVMQR2DT73W B00BGAZYLI 5 1388275200 50 My grandson got me started on this app.  It was free.  It has upgrades you can buy and there can be purchase along with it.  I stayed with the free app, and no purchases.  From time to time I go back to it and use it as a mind exercise.
A13ZVMQR2DT73W B0064X7FVE 3 1393200000 24 It is okay for a general idea of what may happen, but it is not accurate. I prefer the radio forcast to this app.
A13ZVMQR2DT73W B00DJFIMW6 5 1388275200 20 This was a free game.  Yea!  My grandson enjoys playing this game on my Kindle Fire when he is visiting.
A1402OOC6A1DD9 B00AW3FDIO 5 1377302400 33 BIG ZOMBIE FAN THIS GAME DEFINITELY TAKES THE CAKE!!! Good graphics, different types of zombies so you don't get bored killing the same ones, guns galore and different characters... like I said AWESOMENESS!!!
A1402OOC6A1DD9 B007BFSYMS 5 1364515200 49 I am a person who suffers from an anxiety disorder at 20yrs old, and need something to relax me and this helps take the edge off and bring me to my center. If u need help sleeping or have anxiety too, then this app is right for you :)
A1402OOC6A1DD9 B00A04F8NU 4 1359936000 37 Is a funny game, and very adorable it starts off very easy but I believe it begins to become more difficult, I have to play more to find out though but is a very fun game :)
A1402OOC6A1DD9 B00APKHA9Y 5 1359417600 24 Great graphics, awesome game play, and GORY!! If you love zombies, you will love Dead Trigger it is a must have for zombie fanatics
A1402OOC6A1DD9 B007ET5P4Q 3 1364083200 51 Great comic graphics, and has a fun storyline that you can interact with by making decisions and answering questions, only problem is twice! I left it and wanted to come back to it later but it did not save and everytime I had to start from the beginning.. only down fall.
A1402OOC6A1DD9 B0085VR7WU 3 1367884800 56 Well when I try to play I went to train first, and now when I try to do the other things it keeps forcing me to click training. Do you have to beat the training before you may move on to the other things? HELP! Lol. Other then that it is very fun :) &amp;&amp; Addicting.
A14034IO0T2JDU B00FS0VUWO 5 1398902400 42 Really enjoy this flight sim.  I have ran the battery on my tablet and phone down playing this game.  I know it's not ultra realistic but easy and fun work.  The graphics are great and the aircraft really feel different to me.
A14034IO0T2JDU B006ZE9Q5A 5 1334361600 23 Played it abit after I downloaded.  Very fun and enjoyable game.  Works nice on my HP Touchpad with Android. Well worth the price!
A14034IO0T2JDU B007EUADC4 2 1332028800 21 Nice graphics and sound but neither option for control work.  Tilt control is backwards and touch sorta works.  Nice try though.
A14034IO0T2JDU B004TA2F14 5 1320364800 20 Love this app and use it alot.  You can use your voice, type, or scan a grocery list.  Very handy!
A14034IO0T2JDU B0055SWM08 5 1313280000 30 This game is challenging and relaxing to play.  One of the best Android games I have played.\nI like to read and then play Quell before bed.  Music is nice too.
A1403HFDUJB5LV B00I6WBHD8 4 1393372800 32 Just started playing &amp; it's fun but maybe made more for a young child. I gave it a 4 star hoping that it will get to be more difficult as I progress.
A1403HFDUJB5LV B0064X7FVE 2 1377648000 55 If I had been asked to review this app a year ago, when I had 1st downloaded it, it would ha e gotten 5 stars. However, now, after the update it isn't the same. Too many ads and other junk with it!! Don't waste your time ... look for something else ... I will be.
A1403HFDUJB5LV B00BHHIWQO 2 1383436800 55 Fun game and addictive if you like matching games but ... what gives them the right to stop game play because you won't rate it! I paid for the game so why do I have to rate it if I don't want to. Sucks when they stop all game play if you won't rate it.
A1403HFDUJB5LV B00AA87JGU 1 1373760000 32 Maybe it's because I am playing the free version but .... what a snore!!!Simplistic is the best way to describe this game. A few instructions wouldBe nice too for the pay version.

A1403JJ8U1OM56 B009G41CG2 3 1391299200 22 the game of mahjong is always fun to play but on the kindle it hard to do because of the small screen
A1403JJ8U1OM56 B004TI2ZXY 3 1391299200 20 it works but hard to carry your kindle a round when you have it on your phone but it works
A1403JJ8U1OM56 B00H2BJ7HC 1 1391299200 20 the game was until they wanted to upgrade which never happen and i lost all my winnings in the game
A1404XMFP2U4CQ B006PJ3UKC 4 1366156800 20 Very informative and updated frequently. I really enjoy having it at my fingertips.I wish you could change the weather default.
A140A2QGEYH5R3 B00ATDOVNK 4 1360627200 26 Enjoyed this one. Challenging and yet not too difficult. Graphics were well done., which is normal for G5 and can't wait for the next new game.
A140A2QGEYH5R3 B009ZKSPDK 5 1362441600 84 I love this game. My daughter and I play while sharing the wonderful buildings we have created, along with the hallarious situations we find ourselves in with the animals and werewolves. Our intentions are to eventually change into the survivor mode, but not sure when because it is just so much fun in the creative mode. Did I mention that one of us in the mid 60's and other 40's. Our families can't believe it but enjoy hearing our stories and seeing our creations.
A140A2QGEYH5R3 B00913DPW2 3 1346284800 23 Loved it until the continued freeze. Heard about an update but my kf hasn't got the news. Please fix and I'll start again.
A140AOJ1QPNO5Q B00AREIAI8 4 1387324800 26 Its pretty fun no glitches so far!Hope you have fun... :P so it's a pretty nice game you can groom take pictures and other stuff so...yeap
A140AOJ1QPNO5Q B00AEORXR0 5 1374796800 27 I LOVE msp i have played it on the computer and my friend said try the app! I love mspAdd me: MusicLover2101Im VIP but not for long....
A140AOJ1QPNO5Q B007HGMVIE 4 1377993600 28 This is a fun game you start out with quiet a bit of money and choose buildings for your place its fun but you have to be patient
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00A04F8NU 3 1367798400 21 It wasn't all that challenging.  It was way too easy to find the hidden objects.  Got bored with it pretty fast.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00FCYEZOQ 5 1390694400 22 Just another game to exercise your brain and whittle away some time while waiting in the doctors office with other sick people
A140C84ZOOM6SK B0063IH60K 5 1347408000 23 Just love this game.  Easy to play and graphics are kind to the eyes.  I like just being able to tap a play.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00COVCV50 4 1378598400 20 Entertaining.  Something to do while trying to fall asleep at night.  A little different from the other games out there.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B009UWME8U 3 1367798400 22 I love word games, but this just wasn't that exciting.  I got bored with it soon after playing.  It was different though.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B009G9KFQ0 5 1366934400 28 I like being able to see the weather for my area as well as my relatives and friends in other states.  Being able  to get results right now.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00AF0IKRK 5 1389571200 20 Love getting these in my inbox every day.  I have used many of these deals and you can save lots.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B0069Y4E08 3 1366934400 21 I'm a late bloomer on trying this game and I wasn't really impressed.  I prefer word games which are more challenging.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B006RIQIFK 1 1386633600 24 I just didn't care for the looks of the tiles.  They were hard to see and just too small.  I like the game though.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00FAPF5U0 5 1389571200 20 Downloaded this last night and it's very hard to put down.  A great game to play  while on the go.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00ALKKM98 3 1366934400 21 I can get lost going around the corner, so this game was very hard for me.  Thank goodness for GPS now
A140C84ZOOM6SK B0094BB4TW 5 1367798400 20 I downloaded the mobile version and this app is great.  I can keep up with my friends posts and happenings.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B004SHLE2Y 1 1366934400 21 I downloaded this to mess with the grandkids and they were really disgusted my the sounds.  Sorry for the bad review.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00B5DLSMU 5 1402617600 20 A fast paced game that is a lot of fun.  Different from most word games.  Like playing with other players
A140C84ZOOM6SK B00A0XOT68 5 1367798400 29 I like testing myself on how many of these logos are easily recognizable.  Others, I have had to search all over trying to figure them out.  Lots of fun.
A140C84ZOOM6SK B0064X7B4A 5 1362009600 23 Much more fun than a crossword puzzle.  Keeps the brain active for sure.  So many two letter words to add to your vocabulary.
A140EP41UYOAK0 B00CA3C1N4 2 1374451200 53 This seems to me to attack as fast as you can and hope it happens to fall your way. No control of resources, where and what to build. Just attack with the ships you are given, which is always 20-25 percent less than the computer is given. Looks good, just no game play.
A140EU4BPHFTN2 B0066T8SDU 5 1389225600 30 I have played this game for years and this game is just as good as the board game. It is very exciting and the computer gives you a real challange.
A140EU4BPHFTN2 B00AOF15V4 4 1389225600 43 This is a very good game. My problems are that it moves to fast and you don't get a chance to see what's happening. There shhould also be more than two option levels. It can get boring very fast after a few games.
A140EU4BPHFTN2 B004HE5TAG 2 1389225600 21 You have to spend too much real money, otherwisw a very nice game. I hope a re-design is in the works.
A140GMI103KGAA B009LQ8X58 4 1366329600 20 Keeping the devices running as fast as possible is important to me and this app defrags to make this work.
A140GMI103KGAA B00AR83PN4 5 1368489600 21 Anything &#34;Cubis&#34; has my vote for fun and adaptability. I've gotten both Cubimania and Cubistry and love them both very much.
A140GMI103KGAA B008IJT0CE 5 1368489600 31 There are so many combinations and sounds.  I love going to sleep with it on ~ the two hour timer that you can set is perfect for a restful night's sleep.
A140GMI103KGAA B008393Q2O 4 1366329600 20 The times I've used it I've liked it.  If I change my opinion I'll come back and change the rating.
A140GY6BSJ5ZXD B006TH5I28 5 1340064000 31 I like knowing how much time I have left. not the % of battery left.  This app is customizable; timer. alerts. viewpoints.  Yes there is a fee. but well worth it.
A140GY6BSJ5ZXD B007MRQOXQ 5 1358726400 48 I use this app daily.  Mike not only presents books, but gives advice, other links, and has a great sense of humor.  Occasionally, an author will write a a short piece.  He often adds to his blog, so check it at night.  Thanks Mike, you're a great read!
A140GY6BSJ5ZXD B00910Y1OQ 5 1350691200 20 Read the history, gain some knowledge.  A combination of match game and history all wrapped into a strategic tile swap.
A140K25IOFQQXH B0064X7B4A 4 1362009600 29 I really enjoy being able to play this game on my kindle. Sometimes it does freeze when the ads pop up, but other than that, it is very enjoyable.
A140K25IOFQQXH B00846F1YW 5 1361059200 61 I have Mysteryville on my pc so when I saw this for kindle I had to get it. I was not disappointed. I have tried other hidden object games on my kindle and found that they were hard to see. The zoom on this game makes it a lot easier to search. I will definitely look for more games from Nevosoft.
A140OCXI2WFH86 B00E3OUQ5S 4 1384560000 25 This game is great but I do believe it should have a better turtorial and an explanation of what the parts of the gun are.
A140OCXI2WFH86 B00E994GPI 5 1378425600 20 I really enjoy playing the game, my game did update so maybe it is just on certain kindles, great game
A140T7MEQKWZRT B00DLJ31HQ 4 1373328000 62 I've only been playing this game for a couple days and have found it entertaining and a tiny bit challenging.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for an app to occupy down time or just wanting to stretch their brain a little. The only thing I would have to grumble about is the &quot;20 word minimum&quot; on the reviews. ; )
A140T7MEQKWZRT B00FXKHEK6 4 1383523200 37 My 5 yr old grandson and I play this together. He guesses and I type in the name. We have also played it at birthday parties. I hold up the picture and who ever guesses first wins.
A140T7MEQKWZRT B008Y7SMQU 4 1357084800 37 I wasn't sure about this game when I "purchased" it. But free is a good price and now it has become addictive. Try it. I bet you will find it a challenge you won't to put down.
A140T7MEQKWZRT B00BJRH6HS 3 1385769600 26 No flaws really but not the most exciting game ever. It's good for a logic game though. Solid 3 stars. That's a good rating from me........
A140T7MEQKWZRT B008MM9630 4 1368230400 28 This is pretty fun! I must agree it's to bad you have to spend cash to complete a quest. Aside from that once you get going it's addictive.
A140TEKZUTG7A2 B00992CF6W 5 1387065600 22 I love it you should get it its fun,cool,addicting,awesome and you can do so much the possibilities are endless!!! ( :  :D
A140TEKZUTG7A2 B00G6ZTM3Y 5 1387065600 28 This game is awesome I love it you should get this game get it get it your child will probably love it its so addicting!!! ( :  :D
A140TEKZUTG7A2 B009HN0V6E 5 1387670400 43 I love it but it still has a few bugs but other then that its awesome if you accidentally made one of your worlds survival but you wanted it to be creative just use this and change it I hope it helps you!
A140TEKZUTG7A2 B00CO6TOZA 5 1398816000 24 Thais game is great you can do so many things it's so fun you should get this game it's really fun fun fun fun
A140UIN0VMPG86 B00BG3ID0Y 5 1365897600 21 I love this game so much! it wastes time easily and its fun. some are easy and some are realllllyy hard
A140V6I8PXPSPD B007ZGO7EM 4 1382054400 22 Works like a calculator. Very nice too have easy access I'm always misplacing the house calculator and this one I never lose.
A140V6I8PXPSPD B009HKL4B8 4 1383350400 21 It's very addicting. I haven't found any glitches yet. Just can't put it down completing one tall after another and another.
A140X3H3NPKFVQ B00K7WGUKA 5 1405987200 26 I love this game. when I'm bored I play this game. when I am on the road to somewhere I play this game. it is awesome.
A140X3H3NPKFVQ B00AREIAI8 5 1402444800 23 I love this game it is so real. I wish all my friends knew about this game they would love it so much.
A140X3H3NPKFVQ B00HY9UK28 5 1398556800 21 I love this game it is so much fun I am like addicted to it my kindle is always plugged in...
A140YAVKC32HCZ B00APKHA9Y 4 1364860800 26 The game is good.....a tad glitchey but good. It is black ops zombies on the go. The game has incredible graphics and a great combat system.
A140YAVKC32HCZ B009HQ9UHC 1 1364947200 32 Rovio was not thinking clearly. This game is really bad and nothing like angry birds in terms of game play. Just please stick to making birds fly through a sling shot. please
A140YAVKC32HCZ B00992CF6W 5 1364860800 20 This app is one of the best apps for the Kindle. I loved it so much...it was money well spent.
A140Z99Y42V0KJ B008JGSM6G 5 1383782400 24 It's an easy game that is solved quickly and passes time without too much concentration.  Graduate to harder levels as you solve each one.
A140Z99Y42V0KJ B006MI4JEM 5 1379721600 21 One of my favorite.  Easy to play and challenging.  Great game for passing the time away.  Try it.  You'll like it.
A1411N7GAO8TIV B009XFDFPU 5 1367712000 33 Nuff said.  But this review box has a &quot;20 word minimum.&quot; Wonderlines: Match-3 Puzzle game has given me hours and hours of play time without even a burp in the system (game) .
A1411N7GAO8TIV B00785P2QC 1 1357862400 222 I played this game a few times.  The first two times I got really far in the game and spent a lot of money on it before it just stopped working (said I didn't have enough City credits to buy anything.  I had 42,000,000).  Even called support the second time (about six months ago) and they didn't know why this was happening, they were working on it, they would get back to me and asked me not to delete it.  (They didn't offer to give ANY of my money back.)  That was over six months ago and still haven't gotten back to me.  I did delete it.  Seeing it has been a long time, I figured they had MAYBE fixed it and installed it again a few days ago (with the thought of putting NO money on it seeing I already had spent $100s on it.)  I got to the point of putting liked on facebook for some &quot;points, &quot; and it threw me out without saving anything I had done today on it.  It was stupid of me to put all my work back in and try it a second time, to have the same thing happen.  I do not know how this game got so many stars because it seems to me to be a money getting trap from G5.
A14127B8EE6QOV B00IKZX1ZI 4 1396742400 42 I love the game. It is fun to play & it is also a challenge. I don't like that I have to wait for a timer to run out in order to play again after I have failed to complete a level.
A14127B8EE6QOV B00H42WDAC 5 1388620800 29 The scenes and hidden objects are varied on the different levels.  The different levels keep my interest.  This game is fun to play no matter how old you are.
A14127B8EE6QOV B00F0T18QQ 3 1390003200 37 I enjoy finding the objects. The game is interesting. However, the game doesn't allow the items to be enlarged. Sometimes I can't discern what the object is that I'm to find because the object is so small.
A141AW0IW0AR9 B004SUWR2C 4 1356825600 123 This version of Uno is pretty jacked up.  It has the weirdest rules I have ever seen.  It only vaguely resembles the wonderful card game we played growing up.  I'm still not quite sure how I managed to do it but I did manage to win. The new &quot;rule&quot; I find most odd and distasteful is when you have 2 cards left and they make you switch hands with a player that has 15 cards.  So not cool!!!  I got the game for free so I'll keep it but just wanted to warn others.  If you are expecting the game to play like the real life game, you might find your money better spent on Phase 10 or Scrabble.Hope this review helps others.
A141HMZ2IXH0J2 B004ANMWPY 2 1389657600 88 I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  This app has some nice features and one that doesn't work for me.  Under Settings I should be able to "Filter channels" so that I can scroll through only those channels in which I am interested instead of all 542 of them (similar to the Comcast Favorites feature).  This feature works for a while then loses my input and I am back to scrolling through 542 channels.  I'll put this app on the back burner until they get this issue resolved.
A141HMZ2IXH0J2 B00AOA9BL0 4 1402963200 32 This app is okay except for the fact that episode selection on an individual show is rather limited.  It also requires a comcast.net account which I didn't have but needed to get.
A141HMZ2IXH0J2 B00850NK6I 4 1366243200 21 Checking out ebooks through my library's software caused problems and could be cumbersome at times.  Using OverDrive eliminated both of those.
A141IQUDDXQ721 B00702PZME 4 1333843200 33 This game is a nice time consumer. It was also fun for my daughter and I, the lower levels worked her brain. As it went on it gave us both a mental jolt.
A141IQUDDXQ721 B008VRQNIC 5 1353283200 26 I am completely addicted to this game.  there r some glitches that need to be looked at. but on the whole it is a cool app.
A141IQUDDXQ721 B005LVLJP8 4 1353888000 27 for a spades app this one is pretty good. its nice that you can choose the level of play, and the different partners you can choose from.
A141KBGAD1KWKD B00D4EBQ3E 5 1394668800 55 I really enjoy this app.  Some of the words come easily, some you really have to work for.  I like the button that lets you post the words on Facebook to ask friends for help.  It does not put pressure on your friends to respond like other word games, but allows friends to voluntarily participate.
A141KBGAD1KWKD B008ZOHCKE 4 1361836800 46 It saves paper, pens and doesn't clutter the house.  What's not to like?  It gives me a place to store writings, to  journal, even stores my own personal recipes.  It doesn't take a lot of space, but it is always close and portable.  I like it!
A141KT8JSAJLVF B0055DUUDE 1 1309132800 23 Does not work on EVO 3D, uninstalling. Major, major fail. Games needs to work on newest phones.  Typing until I get twenty words..
A141KT8JSAJLVF B009GFCVNO 1 1353024000 20 WTF! You can only run the tutorial once. That's just stupid. Uninstalled. And this 20 character rule is stupid too.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B004QJGPNM 1 1301961600 26 Apps this large needs to have save to SD Card, it's almost 20mg!  Also, very poor controls for my EVO. Uninstalling. Good try, but major fail.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B004N8R576 1 1313193600 27 Really couldn&apos;t play around with it, not full screen on my unrooted HTC EVO 3D. So uninstalled. Major fail. Developers really need to fix this issue. \n
A141KT8JSAJLVF B0057IQ0C2 1 1308787200 20 Game runs find on my HTC EVO 4G, but controls are impossible to work.  Looks beautiful so its a shame.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B00AMR1HZ8 3 1396569600 43 Lots of bugs, game crashes a lot. But at least it saves your game. Mpoints system crashes every time you get a bonus but it can be turned off. Needs update to make more stable and to add new changes to TV game.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B004Y21WXE 1 1309910400 23 Looks great but has every unit of volume except grams. Child is on special diet that requires me to measure and convert daily.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B00A37XD90 5 1388793600 23 Lots to do. A wonderful challenge. This is just a great game. I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a challenge.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B004DLPXAO 1 1353801600 53 Forcing me to sign in and reload books daily. Amazon saids its a issue with the Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean, with no idea of a fix. Overseas call center is useless and can't speak enough English to understand.  Very disappointed, I've used app for many years with no issues on many phones.
A141KT8JSAJLVF B007ET5P4Q 3 1332028800 24 Fun and quick choose your own story game. Unfortunately, no SD Card support with a 45mb game. And you need Adobe Air to run.
A141M171JIBUXY B005KCQZ2K 5 1353369600 45 I have had this app for about a year and have never been forced to use real money. it encourages you to upgrade, but you don't have to. you can also gain more assistants by playing more, untill you have enough money to buy one.
A141M171JIBUXY B00689PMD2 5 1327190400 53 great game, but if your kids are so young they buy stuff on accident, the OBVIOSLY they are to young to.play it. So go ahead people, give it 1 star just because you let your kids who are to young to be playing on a device without your supervision mess around on it.
A141M171JIBUXY B007LCZJPQ 1 1335484800 20 I hate it. it doesn't work. too buggy. do not get, as it constantly freezes the screen. DO. NOT. GET!!!!!!
A141M171JIBUXY B005ZXWMUS 4 1325462400 123 works excellent on kindle fire and most 4g phones, but not on my lg Optimus. I think it is an app that deserves praise. on the other hand, I think the creators shouldn't let it download on certain devices (lg optimus) untill all bugs have been fixed. the problem with it on my lg optimus is that the screen breaks up about every 15 seconds, causing the screen to be about 5 minutes behind dialouge, but overall, I love the app. Oh, and you also don't have to be in range of your wi-ti to watch, but it picks up perfectally as long as you have more than 2 bars on your phone. less than that and the picture wont be as clear.
A141M171JIBUXY B004VMUS9G 5 1332115200 71 it lives up to my expectations. this is by far better than any store bought alarm clock, and the best out of about five others I've tried by far. you can customize snooze, and pick from many other settings. GET IT!!! the adds are at the bottom of the screen, and aren't in the way! this is fine, and it isn't necessary to pay unless you have a Phobia of adds.
A141M171JIBUXY B004SJ3BCI 5 1325462400 32 for those of you who play your apps constantly, I'm not sure you'd want this. it is an excellent time passer, and when you watch a show, its perfect for the comercials.
A141M171JIBUXY B008FRG6JO 5 1371859200 28 This app works really great and easily, unlike Domino's mobile website. They show you deals and even have coupons you just tap to use. It is really helpful!
A141M171JIBUXY B0080IOHLW 1 1340582400 32 I was soooo happy with this game untill it deleted my progress.this makes me SOOOO MAD CAUSE I WAS DOING SO GOOD!!!! I refuse to play this game unroll it is fixed
A141M171JIBUXY B005UQ9FNC 1 1326672000 20 game for little kids, say three and under. CONSTANTLY crashes on kindle fire and works ok 1out of 15 times.
A141Q1RNWRPGBB B004JZBGWI 5 1380844800 42 I use this app more and more. I find I never have paper anymore so I grab my Kindle and take notes whenever I need it :) It also allows you to organize your notes so that they are easy to find.
A141Q1RNWRPGBB B00FS0VUWO 4 1388275200 30 I enjoyed playing this game while waiting for glue to dry.I have flown these aircraft with ease I wish the real thing was this easy. This is a great game.
A141Q1RNWRPGBB B00BUR9KJE 5 1380844800 36 I use to play yatzee all the time when I was a kid. I like to play when I'm waiting around at an appointment or while my husband is watching something I'm not interested in ;)
A141Q1RNWRPGBB B006E6NWTK 5 1380844800 29 ...because keeping track is so important ;) I like that I can add symptoms that aren't in the list. After 3 months of tracking it gets even more accurate.
A141WMR8OLLJ01 B008XG1X18 5 1367452800 39 I'm addicted!This app makes it easier to access Pinterest from my device. I can view, pin, and access links much easier with the app from my Fire than I could just loading it from the web on the Fire.
A141WMR8OLLJ01 B005J80RTW 5 1360800000 23 Love this game! By far my favorite game app out there. So bummed I can't get this on my iPhone...get with it Apple!
A141ZCOSSQO36Z B009LT1YZ6 4 1365897600 39 This one is so much fun. Even though you are moving your fish from spot to spot it seems to be soothing too. I really like to make my fish move fast. I would recommend this one to anyone.
A141ZCOSSQO36Z B00846WWVM 5 1365897600 39 This game is so cute and clever. I love the little blue water drops. I also like figuring out how to put the fire out. This game is clever, cute, and fun. I would recommend this game to anyone.
A141ZCOSSQO36Z B00942X8PY 5 1365897600 23 I really like this game. I enjoy figuring out which way I'm supposed to go. This is a good game for the mind.
A141ZZALV89JCT B00G6CFW9K 4 1383782400 23 A really fun game but I wish it had more starting character templates to choose from. Love the mount, it is cute! :)
A141ZZALV89JCT B00DT4GRTM 5 1376870400 23 Can't stop playing this game it is so addicting! The only problem i have found is it is kind of hard to win.
A141ZZALV89JCT B00E8KLWB4 5 1377993600 22 Just started playing and love it already. It is so much fun to play all the puzzles and collect the collections ^^
A141ZZALV89JCT B00AMEFZ72 5 1375833600 23 I have been playing this game non-stop since downloading it. Soooo much fun!  Def. recommend this game :) :)You need to play this.
A141ZZALV89JCT B00FIW5BZE 5 1391817600 25 Fun and addicting game. I love the beautiful boards tiles and setups. A really fun puzzle game. The daily changing boards make for interesting play.
A141ZZALV89JCT B00AA87JGU 5 1372032000 22 Really enjoyed this game a lot. I can't wait to play it again. The only problem is how easy it is, lol.
A141ZZALV89JCT B00CXBSYVG 5 1376870400 28 I got into this game as soon as I tried it. Fun and easy, this is a game that can be played over and over without getting boring.
A141ZZALV89JCT B0091REZMW 5 1381536000 33 It is a lot of fun, easy to lose time playing. The only thing I would change is to have different items appear on each level. Mix it up a bit I mean.
A141ZZALV89JCT B00FAPF5U0 5 1387065600 22 I can't stop playing this game, I even restarted the game so I could replay old levels and get good scores. Lol.
A141ZZALV89JCT B008REEKRA 5 1378425600 30 Reminds me of the old final fantasy games, really awesome! Love the wings too! ^^ they are so cute! Can't wait to see what the higher level stuff looks like.
A1425UODD83JOR B004LZIZHU 3 1374192000 22 I was looking for Candy Crush on Amazon, but this was the closest one I could find.  I do enjoy it occasionally.
A1425UODD83JOR B00CMMR9SU 4 1374192000 30 This game passes time when I'm waiting or bored.  My 2 1/2 yr. old grandson loves it too, and I believe he is better at playing it than I am.
A1425UODD83JOR B00EXVZW6E 4 1381968000 22 This is a fun game.  I like hidden object games, it makes me feel like I accomplish something when I find it.
A1425UODD83JOR B0066T8SDU 4 1353974400 23 I think it is okay, but my step son played it for hours when I first downloaded it.  Fun game to kill time.
A1425UODD83JOR B00A6GNC1M 2 1366329600 25 I just didn't care for this game. I removed it from my Kindle shortly after I received it.  I'm sure some people would enjoy it.
A1426E7TMJ0MWM B00CJ8P82Q 4 1368230400 20 I find I'm not as coordinated as I used to be but its fun when you finally catch on. Enjoy
A1426E7TMJ0MWM B00CX7KW3S 3 1385078400 21 It's not as much fun as my other hidden objects games and it is very dark and not easy to see.
A142AW93OP2FVC B008JK6W5K 5 1344988800 26 I absolutely love this app and I love the logo games period. I have three others and they r all great. I highly reccomend this app.
A142AW93OP2FVC B008N8IV2U 5 1345334400 39 this is one of my favorite games on the world but the only down side to it is that there r only 90 floors on 100 floors but other than that I TOTALLY reccomend this game to EVERYONE!!! :)
A142AW93OP2FVC B005V1N71W 5 1341705600 30 I LOOOOOOOOOVE Pandora, you totally need to get it and you can listen to your favorite songs and other ones like that u might have also heard!!! :)GET PANDORA!!!!  :)
A142AW93OP2FVC B008PB2ZVI 5 1372550400 29 I really like this app and I reccomend it to anyone if you are having troubles on 100 floors. You need to get this app if you are stuck.
A142AW93OP2FVC B0069G5Z9K 5 1345420800 41 I am soooo happy that they finally got this game on kindle fire I play it all the time on my sisters iPod now I can play on my kindle and I totally recommend this app for anyone ans everyone! :)
A142AW93OP2FVC B00DY76ZC8 1 1374969600 23 This app doesn't work even after re-installing it says it stops unexpectedly even thought I have good wifi it still doesn't work. :(

A142AW93OP2FVC B004VGH93A 4 1332028800 23 I LOVE this app!!!! some of it is funny some of it is weird and some just don't make any sense at all
A142AW93OP2FVC B008GTV9DO 1 1341792000 26 I don't like this game at all, and after you download it makes you download more and if you don't download that you cant play.  :/
A142AW93OP2FVC B00B2V66VS 4 1362009600 29 I absolutely LUV this game ALOT!!!! Awesomest game ever only I had to delete it then I had to reload it but other than that it is great! &lt;3
A142AW93OP2FVC B0087TQYUG 5 1341100800 37 I just have so much fun playing on it and you also use your account from words w/ friends so it is on 1 account and at the top of the screen it has the other game.
A142AW93OP2FVC B005HSL626 5 1341619200 39 I love this app I have it on my kindle fire and it looks awesome and the game is oust addicting and I like that u have to unlock the things and it makes u want to play more.
A142AW93OP2FVC B009UX2YAC 5 1356652800 38 This is the greatest game ever!!! the only complaint I have is that u have to have wifi to get ur daily challange but other than that I totally recommend this app for Everyone.  get this app now
A142BF8DVJIT0O B00CKW6FVE 4 1389052800 29 Good game!  Enjoy playing and it's quite addictive also.  I like that you can compete with others to achieve higher scores.Will definitely recommend to my friends that enjoy games.
A142BF8DVJIT0O B00ESCOI7C 4 1393977600 63 This game is interesting and makes you think.  It's amazing to me how many logos you can remember if you think on it long enough.  I am glad that it is not timed because some of them have been pretty tough.  It also amazes me that some of these you see almost daily and still have to really think about what they are!
A142BF8DVJIT0O B00EBE8MUG 4 1392854400 26 This game is entertaining so far.  The picture quality isn't the best but so far I've been able to figure them out.  Hopefully that will continue
A142DW9JWEBQEU B0054JZC6E 5 1338249600 35 Well if u love games then u will love this app!!! its like awesome!!!!! When I first read all the reviews I was hesitant to get it. But I'm super super happy I Did!!! *_*
A142DW9JWEBQEU B004Z2VHAQ 1 1332979200 32 This app is the worst app ever!!! It took a half hour just to get it half way downloaded!! So I advise u DO NOT I REAPEAT DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A142DW9JWEBQEU B006U52MQY 4 1327622400 20 this potato is the funniest potato in the whole world hope u enjoy the Patagonia as much as I do!!!!!!
A142EI4JSSSKB8 B004T68X4Q 4 1326153600 209 I downloaded this app this morning and played with it immediately on the Viewsonic gTablet.  It works great and is very smooth, very good graphics.  I am glad I bought this after reading the reviews because it mimics Chuzzle quite nicely.  Since I can no longer get Chuzzle for the gTablet, this will be a GREAT replacement as my 4 yr old loved that game.I have not had time to go through the different modes, but I am sure it will be fun getting there.As for all the low star ratings that have been posted, you might try power cycling the device and trying again.  The first time I tried this right after installing, the app locked up, but I cycled the device and tried it again and it works flawlessly.  I have had this problem more than once when purchasing from the Appstore, but a good reboot seems to cure it.UPDATE:  After playing the game the first time, all seemed to be working well.  After starting the game to continue where I left off, when the application tries to display the "Continue" screen, the app crashes out.  The gameplay, sound and overall "Feel" is great, and I will change back to a 5 star if this gets addressed.
A142EI4JSSSKB8 B0050D6PH4 5 1309219200 39 Downloaded this hoping it was a lot like the game on my old Windows phone.  Turns out this is WAY better.  Great gameplay, graphics and sounds.  Works great on the gTab.  Free or paid, it is a great game.
A142EMBZOMAEFD B00BG3ID0Y 5 1366243200 22 Creativity, stretch observation power. I enjoy the challenge.Sometimes I leave defeated. Then when I come back, it's obvious. I find it relaxing.
A142EMBZOMAEFD B00CB8JY9M 5 1370390400 72 We have played Farkle with dice. We love it. The chance of dice with the strategy similar to playing poker. This is extremely portable. We can play it anywhere we take our Kindle. You hear the dice rattle in the cup. You see the dice roll. As you select the dice you wish to keep, your score is toted for you. Great display. Boredom while waiting somewhere is no longer a problem.
A142HAT43L5W4W B008IXP8IU 4 1376784000 110 Well, as I said, I am addicted to this game.  The only two "complaints" I have are why are the titles to the categories named as they are.  For example, I just bought "Chocolate".  None of the 50 games had anything to do with chocolate.  So what gives?  Secondly, some of the clues are bordering on, "Are you kidding me?" when I get the answer.  I mean, really.  I absolutely think outside the box, but with some of the clues and subsequent answers, it seems to me that they've stomped on the box and lit it on fire.Other than those two peeves, I'm ordering more of the games.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
A142HAT43L5W4W B0095MVOMC 5 1374105600 48 Like the game Hidden Letters, I wasn't too sure how I'd react to it, but it ends up that I love it.  I'm addicted and even walk around now subconsciously looking for numbers on items around me.  I hope they come out with more games in this series.
A142HAT43L5W4W B00B9AGS42 3 1396224000 42 Love the game, hate the crashes.  I love that when they come out with new content, it's automatically downloaded.  I'm not crazy about all the crashes in the new games.  Hope they fix it soon.  Other than that, I really enjoy them.
A142HAT43L5W4W B00DYY92MG 3 1385251200 42 It's definitely a fun game, but it cost too much for help and pays way too little for solutions. I'm getting a bit tired of the reel-em-in-make-em-pay free games.There is no such thing as a free lunch has never been so active.
A142HAT43L5W4W B0069EAMUY 4 1399593600 46 I've been searching for a Kindle Fire version of Every Word Crosswords but no such luck so I decided to try this game.  I am pleased with the game overall, surprised by how challenging it can be.It's no Every Words, but it's not a bad substitute.
A142HAT43L5W4W B00EBE8MUG 2 1385164800 76 There really needs to be some rhyme and reason for asking for 300 coins to skip a puzzle. Considering that the coins aren't even &quot;real&quot; money, there should not be so imposing a &quot;fine&quot;.So far, the five levels I've done are fun, but the pictures could be clearer and there ought to be a hint button for, perhaps, twenty coins that will offer you a verbal hint before you have to resort to buying letters, etc.
A142HAT43L5W4W B00COVCV50 5 1371600000 22 Love the challenge presented in this game. Love how it makes me really dig deeply o draw a connection between the pictures.
A142POWE47CFZQ B008CFVG58 1 1343779200 20 cute game...similar to diner dash...really really enjoyed it. cute game...similar to diner dash...really really enjoyed it.  yada yada yada yada

A142TIIJI4ST5R B009UX2YAC 5 1396483200 22 This game is fun to play.  The kids like it and it challenges them.  I like it because it is not violent.

A142YGOCSY2SDT B005HK1JFS 5 1339286400 23 I like this game because on fruit ninjas it freezes up on kindle fire I think itnhas better graphics than fruit ninjas also.
A142YGOCSY2SDT B00AREIAI8 4 1359244800 28 I wish you could go to the fair ground with your horse and do more things and the items didn't cost so much horse money and horse gems
A14353MP9KUISH B005EYWT38 5 1402012800 37 Puts my baby to sleep every time  it has option as to how long you want it to run, it lowers the volume as it times out and it's free what more can I say thank you!
A14353MP9KUISH B005AJ6ISO 5 1337817600 23 thank you for this app i like how you can also get a modern day translation altho i enjoy reading  it as is!
A14353MP9KUISH B006OCM13M 3 1341100800 44 i love this game but its not fair to kindle players bc android players get better gift items like the carousel and other items if only we were allowed the same items as aneroid players this would be a five star game no fair!!!!!!!!
A14353MP9KUISH B007F2EGFQ 1 1336348800 30 fix an i change my review was really enjoying this app until i got a screw you sucky app that freezes up and have to shut doen kindle please fix

A1435KSZDQSK9T B006GWE5PM 2 1369699200 40 The game is great when it comes to color, but you can't move and swing the way you need to all the time. The swing is not always picked up, you start to swing and it takes time to react....
A1435KSZDQSK9T B00A4EZ3QS 3 1369699200 20 Just OK, it was a little hard to play on the Kindel, not enought room to make the swips correctly.
A1435KSZDQSK9T B008JJS6D2 1 1369699200 36 I play bingo all the time and I don't go so long with out a Bingo, I think The game is made so you have to spend money, or you can't play the way you want
A1435KSZDQSK9T B009KS4XRO 1 1369699200 24 I think it is riged so you spend money. I won't spend money, so I don't get Bingos. That all I have to say
A1436W3CXN4WKY B00GRVV29E 3 1394755200 29 This makes some very interesting on-screen patterns, but there doesn't seem to be anything you can &#34;do&#34; with it. Reminds me more of a screen saver for your PC.
A1436W3CXN4WKY B00EKDZEF4 5 1382140800 30 This a fun game. The colorful fruits are addicting to match, and the puzzle levels vary in skill enough to make it challenging. A great game at a great price.
A1436W3CXN4WKY B00FEIX5OG 5 1398816000 33 This one is very nice. I'd been looking for another &#34;match 3&#34; game and tried this one. I really enjoy the graphics. Try it and you'll add this one to your favorites.  Enjoy!
A1436W3CXN4WKY B00ILI95HW 5 1393286400 80 Dear Mr. Midnight Appsmith -- thanks for yet another great game in your "match three" line. I've got both fruit drops and the holiday drops, and I was hoping you'd come out with another. Just found this one last night and snapped it up.Your graphics are consistently clear and easy to see. I've tried other "match three" games and lose interest quickly, mainly because the graphics are not distinct.....makes it difficult to see what you're trying to switch.Thank you again!
A1437TXL7U3KQS B00ILI95HW 3 1394496000 51 I bought this because I love Fruit Drops 2. But after playing it for just 1 hour, the so-called hints were so amazingly annoying I deleted it from my Kindle Fire. Get rid of the hints and I'll put it back on and even recommend it. Until then save your money.
A1437TXL7U3KQS B00IAQ3RJM 4 1399075200 31 I like the game but the Facebook integration is annoying. Not everyone is on Facebook. Also the fact that you can't play it offline keeps me from giving it 5 stars.
A143ALLA1UAJNT B006N0Q3TS 5 1340236800 35 great game lots of fun! you can tell someome put a lot of work into this. they should definately make more games lik this' with more varieties. I'm all for this app, great job guys!
A143B9O6EUI1TP B0064X7B4A 1 1374019200 24 This game is soooo bad!!!  It is the worst game ever. It glitches and drains the battery  on my kindle fire. I hate it!
A143B9O6EUI1TP B0064X7FVE 2 1383609600 80 When i first downloaded the wewther channel app, it was great. But since they updated it, the app doesnt update the weather attomatically. Also i have figured out that it drains my battery. My advice, dont buy this app if you want accurate weather or a full battery. Change it back to the way it used to be!!!! Now i hate this app and i deleted it. There are other great weather apps on the market, so try tjem first.
A143EW1VPA4F3X B005ZXWMUS 5 1388448000 22 Love this netflix app, lets my family has hands on access to movies and tv shows when we are on the go.
A143EW1VPA4F3X B00FAPF5U0 5 1388448000 21 My daughter and myself truly love this app it keeps us entertained when there is absolutely nothing to do at home!
A143EW1VPA4F3X B00B7Y0206 5 1388448000 20 Love this youtube app for my kindle, keeps me into all that is going on where ever i go, yay!
A143EW1VPA4F3X B009UX2YAC 5 1388448000 20 Love this app, me and my daughter compete with each others score, very fun and entertaining game for the family.
A143FFZF9SNOYK B007PTJOV0 4 1337126400 22 its pretty impressive for being free.  this game is a lot like Mario. it is worth the download.  I would recommend. it
A143FFZF9SNOYK B004HGK6FW 5 1340496000 24 this game is great if you like sudoku. several different difficulties are available to play.  you can make notes too.  very easy to use.
A143FFZF9SNOYK B007ROSXRO 5 1399852800 24 this app works great and it has a seemingly endless variety of sounds.  I really like the water ones, there are all kinds though
A143FFZF9SNOYK B004O9G750 5 1337299200 22 this is a cool game.  it is similar to many other games like it. it is pretty challenging but not overly so.
A143HFEIZT693E B005V1N71W 5 1356652800 29 I like a variety of music. I like to be able to pick an artist and play music by them yet have other similar artists thrown into the mix.
A143HFEIZT693E B008JJS6D2 1 1388361600 30 I am assuming it is a solitary game because I never see the other winners. I don't want to play by myself. Also difficult to advance without using real money.
A143HFEIZT693E B0066T8JRK 5 1357084800 35 I loved this game as a kid. So with it being 99&cent; I couldn't pass it up. It was fun then and it is fun now especially with the modernization of careers and other spaces.
A143HFEIZT693E B0094BB4TW 2 1356652800 70 I can get more posts on my phone then I can get on the kindle. I can scroll forever on my phone and keep reading posts. I only get a handful of posts on the kindle fire. Very disappointed. I looked for a setting to change but it isn't a setting that I can find. Maybe if I can find the setting I'll change my review but not until then.
A143IQHLBUUU76 B007V2UGPE 3 1335312000 33 it was a good fun game, started to get harder by level 14 or so then made it to level 16 now game wont open,click start game and it does nothing.using a fire.
A143IQHLBUUU76 B00B2V66VS 3 1359331200 53 good game works fine until you start doing good.will run with no problems until I use the save me 3-4 in a single run and get thousands of coins and then use a save me again game will just close.everytime I do good and then use save me game shuts down.works fine otherwise.
A143IQHLBUUU76 B00HDRTGDK 5 1392422400 22 it brings back old fun forgotten memories.its fun hard fun hard fun hard fun hard fun hard good old memories from past

A143K4Y14QQTJO B00CWY76CC 4 1385078400 42 A lot like 100 Floors, but with a little more &#34;searching&#34; to get to the floor solutions.  I've only gone about ten levels so far, but it's a good challenge and fun for me and my grandson to figure out the solutions.
A143K4Y14QQTJO B00HCMG6LG 5 1389916800 25 My four year old grandson and I had lots of fun solving the levels, but some were way too hard for him to do alone.
A143K4Y14QQTJO B00EQ2GBFG 3 1385078400 30 My 4-year old and 1-year old grandkids like it.  Again, another suck in the user with a &#34;free&#34; game with extremely limited functionality until you start dumping money into it.
A143K4Y14QQTJO B00FAPF5U0 4 1383696000 31 What's all the fuss about this app?  There are a bunch of others almost identical to this one and one is even better.  The others might be copycats, but who cares?
A143K4Y14QQTJO B006RM6JCI 5 1381968000 24 Nice, user friendly interface. If you like doing them on your tablet you should like this app.  Difficulty is not very high.  Pleasant diversion.
A143N3HACJOYC7 B005OC3AO2 2 1318464000 36 I'm giving 2 stars because I see the potential. Running a Garminfone v2 and couldn't even play - one round was nothing but lag. Load up time was dreadfully slow. Graphics look really nice tho. Uninstalled
A143N3HACJOYC7 B0058VW36U 5 1317168000 77 just downloaded and can't stop playing! character is adorable. can be quite challenging. not just cutting rope but having to avoid obstacles and using other techniques to get thwarting candy in the cute monsters mouth.I found the interface very easy and it tells you how to play as you go along. graphics are great. I didn't have any lag issues nor did I think other was slow to load. actually I thought it was quite fast.Garminfone v2.2
A143N3HACJOYC7 B007NACZPI 3 1336348800 109 I definitely wouldn't have paid for this game, nor do I pay to purchase extra crystals or any other &quot;in game&quot; options like that for any game. it takes several hours to build anything that will get you any substantial amount of XP credits and coins to buy things.I'm playing in my Toshiba Thrive. The graphics are great but the game play has extreme lag. I find the game play intriguing but it takes forever to move objects around or collect &quot;taxes&quot; etc.Its an average game similar to many others like farmville with the exception that this game tells you Sep by step what tasks you need to accomplish.
A143N3HACJOYC7 B008194C74 5 1338249600 26 I love this! It is so unique! Plus with the FAOTD I received such a great deal. Thank you big time to the developers and Amazon!
A143N3HACJOYC7 B004QOP62S 3 1320796800 24 won't stop shuffling the letters. makes it very difficult to make words. couldn't barely play. uninstall. should have option - must be too sensitive
A143N3HACJOYC7 B004GYVYV0 3 1333584000 29 This is a big disappointment. I think it needs the option to create an account to link between phones.... I need to share data with my tablet and phone
A143N3HACJOYC7 B0074AKEDC 3 1339286400 103 I really want to live this game but it its driving me insane.Tiki issue its solved by using the stumps on the right and left hand sides of the screen. In all my puzzle piece searching I skimmed right over what those were. Now i'm on the ship level and have cine to the part wetter you have to burn the fire with the magnifying glass... Impossible!! Super glitchy and can't get it to stay focused at all. Rest of game play its great. Graphics are alright. Still fun and interactive. But I can't go anywhere until this is fixed!Running on Toshiba Thrive
A143N3HACJOYC7 B007PTJOV0 5 1335225600 55 very similar game play just more simple compared to its famous Nintendo counterpart. Great graphics and for the most part, great game play as well. I experienced a few minor glitching of the characters but nothing terrible.I love this game! Found a leprechaun to be a bit random but overall I really like this app
A143N3HACJOYC7 B007HSP57Q 4 1331942400 95 Considering this is a seasonal app - I don't see any problem with their being very few puzzles, however a few more selections or different ones for different levels would be nice.I found the game play very smooth. I think the graphics are great. No complaints in that department. Running on Toshiba Thrive.Considering the above, I wouldn't pay for this app unless I really wanted the entertainment value for myself or child; however, because it is a holiday related app I have a hard time paying for it. Plus the limited selection. Great for FAOTD.
A143RP0FNMB8VN B0085N9I84 4 1375142400 23 After getting caught up in the Bingo games this game was a nice change of pace. Plus the little monsters are so cute.
A143RP0FNMB8VN B009WJNXAE 4 1369958400 25 Fun game to play. Wish it was easier to get bingo credits but I still love this game. Its connection with Facebook allows more friends.
A143RP0FNMB8VN B009KS4XRO 5 1376092800 31 This was the first bingo game I purchased. I love it so much I have purchased many bingo game since. I can honestly say this is the best one so far.
A143RP0FNMB8VN B00AMEFZ72 4 1375056000 29 With all the Bingo games out there, and trust me I own enough, Im glad I chose to get just one more. This is a nice change of pace.
A143S0O7B8ZM15 B0080IOHLW 5 1337385600 37 I really like this game. It's hard to explain, lol, but when I'm at school I only think about how my little stores are stocked and what I can buy next. The dragons are adorable too. :D
A143S0O7B8ZM15 B005DSLRDS 5 1329436800 33 To those who say it's too inappropriate, there are only 2-3 buttons like that, which you can HIDE! And there are.like 70+ others that are both clean AND funny...yes...it can be both. -_-
A143S0O7B8ZM15 B00EBQRSTK 3 1376956800 24 its a good app, really addictive, but it seems just like what's the word levels. like the.pictures are the same for levels even... unoriginal
A143TDAB21AXO0 B0094BB4TW 5 1391299200 20 I spend much too much time on Facebook but have enjoyed keeping touch with neices and nephews, children and grandchildren.
A143TDAB21AXO0 B00FX6ZBXC 5 1401753600 49 I love my Word Chums. We play for fun. I don't worry about who wins.....just have fun playing. Gives my brain a workout and is right there when I have time to play. If Chums are unavailable I can ask for a new opponent or play a Chumbot. Fun.
A143TDAB21AXO0 B00AQ398AY 4 1391299200 22 Glad to have this on my tablet. Never even thought of security issues until I purchased and then wondered what to do.
A143TDAB21AXO0 B0064X7B4A 2 1403481600 30 Screen small on my Kindle. Hate the ads. It is nice to play with my friends but I'm playing another scramble type game which is faster an more trouble free.
A143TDAB21AXO0 B00CKW6FVE 2 1391299200 21 Not as much fun as other Tetris games I have played. I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to recommend.
A143TDAB21AXO0 B00CRHF748 3 1391299200 22 I am disturbed that this site has limited free puzzles and that I must purchase more when I finish the free ones.
A143TO0LD6UTC B006PKQQSE 5 1347580800 21 Great app!  Would love it even more without the ads but still a lot of fun.  Perfect for honing your skills.
A143TO0LD6UTC B00AVGGYNA 4 1368576000 21 Fun free Bingo  game.Give it a try.  I think you'll like it.  Bonuses power-ups and challenges make it an interesting game.
A143TO0LD6UTC B009KS4XRO 3 1374883200 42 Love this game when it is working properly.  Unfortunately the app often freezes during play.  This can be very frustrating...especially when you have a good game under way.  If theycould remedy the technical issues I would give this game a 5* rating.
A143VJ27NTELXZ B008JJ7XYK 4 1344902400 71 this game is super fun and cute. the monsters are easy to start but going from a 2000 coin habitat to upgrade is 50,000 coin???? this is ridiculous. the monsters are fun to breed and not too hard to get cool ones. but prices are silly. I keep playing but I wish it was more fair. and that it needs wick. not cool either. buttttt its just a time consuming app.
A143VJ27NTELXZ B00A8ECU24 5 1355011200 24 this game is the funest game I have on my kindle fire!!!! I play every day all day!!!! so so so so much fun!!!!
A143VJ27NTELXZ B009UWL580 4 1353974400 29 I'll get any of the apps by game circus. yeah you can only play for a bit, but its a great time waster!! :) I really enjoy this game!!!
A143VVPKZRLBZG B007D2XSW0 5 1376352000 23 Can add all pics from my phone and pc to my kindle then play with them n then send them to get developed
A143WLJUWUN4O7 B009O2XY12 3 1364515200 24 It's not as user friendly as some games but still enjoyable to play. Sometimes the balls are hard to put where you direct them.
A143WLJUWUN4O7 B00AEJM6H2 5 1364515200 25 This game is addictive! I love it. It's a lot like &#34;bejeweled&#34; which is what I wanted to be able to have on my Kindle.
A143WLJUWUN4O7 B0063IH60K 4 1364515200 25 An enjoyable past-time! This game can be addictive as well and it's fun to play. It's an old standby that will never lose it's intrigue.
A143ZFIE0W195Q B007XKEY6Q 5 1348272000 23 This is a time not-waster since you don't just get to draw for people to guess but you can socialize too! asdf smosh.com
A143ZFIE0W195Q B008KMAJQU 5 1349654400 56 Addicting and does not need that fast internet if you are playing multiplayer. Guns are fair and it kinda disgusts me that the fat zombie blows up and reveals those little worm zomblets. Just wish could see the little worms better. SUGGESTION: Do not go to the big map levels- zombies go a thousand a wave.
A143ZFIE0W195Q B004UID2LC 4 1344211200 21 Great, downloaded ninety percent of videos successfully, except that I would like it to download in background because it does not.
A143ZFIE0W195Q B007MFFE52 4 1345680000 27 Really good and so addicting though you cannot really see what is happening, it just tells you. (If you wanna be my ally my name is filipinordabest)
A143ZFIE0W195Q B007OXASB2 1 1345766400 134 I was playing World War by Storm8 when it says that I should get this game if I want 10 honor points. Well, I did get this game for like 20 minutes till I uninstalled it. Well, I could take care of my REAL DOG IN REAL LIFE (and still have fun w/ her) 80% cheaper.REACTION WHILE PLAYING THE GAME: This dog gets sick like every time and I have to get s****y bucks for this PIXELATED BITCH?Guys/Gals at least I spend some time in the dictionary and found out that bitch isn't a bad word. But kids do not say that. It is like saying 'down there'.LONG STORY SHORT- DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$$$$$$$$ ON THIS BOTTOMLESS WELL. FREE IS JUST A COVERUP FOR MOST GAMES. AND YOU COULD GET A REAL DOG.
A143ZFIE0W195Q B008DGDK64 5 1362700800 51 Every single gun works well, does everything correctly and has smooth animations. One thing: the Colt Anaconda and the other revolver has one flaw: the cartridge does not rotate when cocked, unlike in real life. Also Tapjoy gives little points for free games. Can you fix that in the next update?
A143ZRCX5VYKDR B00IAQ3RJM 5 1398384000 36 I love that this was the FAOTD, I'm having a blast playing, I even like it better than Candy Crush Saga! Love that it's available for the Kindle unlike so many of my other Facebook games
A143ZRCX5VYKDR B00KWVZ750 5 1403136000 21 It is a amazing game to play and  cool it is a very advanced technology game you should get the game
A1440ALLWT5XMA B00DRPVE3M 4 1386115200 29 This game is so addicitive. It has worked properly on all my connections. Haven't had an problems. But the ads are a bit much even though its free app
A1440ALLWT5XMA B00EEDJHXA 4 1391731200 45 One really good thing about this game is the fact it feels like it goes on forever. So many levels over 100. Some that take a second to bet while others a bit more time and more tries. Really good value for its low price.
A1441T19Q4WEPI B00DUF0MOQ 5 1374364800 20 Fun twist to a classic game! The animation and sound effects bring new life to solitaire. I enjoyed playing it.
A14425YMXACDP8 B00G5LQ5MU 4 1384905600 30 I got stuck trying to get into the engine room, I'm righting this review to get a free hint. Yes u have to pay real money for hints, that stinks!!
A14425YMXACDP8 B00AREIAI8 4 1374451200 36 I just got this app but it's awesomeness!!!!!! I totally recommend it to people that like horses!!!! :):) I am 11 and I think people around the age of 9 and up will enjoy this game!
A14425YMXACDP8 B00ANH526W 3 1382832000 25 It's fun for a couple of days and then it's gets old. I'm very glad it was  free, plus it's very had  to earn diamonds.
A14425YMXACDP8 B00CZDSK7K 4 1371168000 23 Fun game but I can't figure out how to have kids!!! I would defenately recommend this game for peeps that like management games!
A14425YMXACDP8 B007SYWFRM 4 1379030400 32 This app is great but kinda gets boring after a while. They had  lots of updates and now you have to check on it every day or you have to pay acorns.
A14425YMXACDP8 B00BFUUMO8 4 1370304000 24 Fun game!!!!! Kinda hard to level up though, other than that it's a really fun game!!Awesome!!!!!  Great!!!!!!! Expencive dinosaurs, I like the the triceratops.
A14425YMXACDP8 B00GUY712U 4 1389916800 45 It works on the kindle fire but I have a friend who says it won't work on iPod. It's a great game for kindle fire, I really like it the eggs are cute and easy to take care of. Get it if you like pets!!!!
A14425YMXACDP8 B00AUB8GA0 4 1377561600 27 It's a really fun game but I blew through it in like 20 minutes!  I think you should get it if you like quick and easy games.
A14425YMXACDP8 B004K55CQ8 4 1385424000 27 It's really fun until u run out of people to make but I guess when that happens u can just goof off and make whatever u want!!
A14425YMXACDP8 B00D2K40WY 5 1371945600 41 This game is great!!!!!! Way better than wedding salon. I highly recommend this app for people that love makeup!! You get to wash her hair, pop her  pimples , and put on her makeup!!! And decide a beautiful dress and stuff!!
A1444LDGJFI44O B00C7TAF3Y 5 1373846400 42 This is probably the coolest escape and puzzle game I have ever played. I am 9 years old and it was challenging but not too difficult for me to do alone. I cannot wait to get the second version of it soon!
A1444LDGJFI44O B007SYDYLS 5 1363996800 37 This game really makes you think in a fun and creative way. Even when there is more than one way to connect certain words in a stack, it's not frustrating at all. Very challenging and interesting game!
A1444LDGJFI44O B008JK6W5K 5 1390348800 20 It's a fun and very affordable. It's the best logo quiz game in the App store and it's very fun.
A1446RQ2MZIH2S B004K4RY9M 5 1331424000 73 I have this on my phone, and it is a bit too small to be easy to use. On the Kindle Fire, it is fantastic! I have enjoyed doing the word search puzzles most of my life, and to have this as an app is way cool!If you like word searches, this one is done very well, and it is worth the time to download it. Do yourself a favor and try it!
A1446RQ2MZIH2S B00658U5HE 4 1331424000 69 Pretty simple battery monitor that I put on my Kindle Fire. Can't say for sure that it has done anything other than be a tattletale on running processes, but easy enough to use and real intuitive. One of those set it and forget it apps, although I guess I don't forget it too often seeing as I do go and check out remaining battery life with it fairly often.
A1446RQ2MZIH2S B0054JZC6E 2 1331424000 38 I was a little disappointed in this one. Found I did not play it hardly at all, so it just got deleted. Some amusing games in there, but nothing that held my interest long enough to keep installed.
A1446RQ2MZIH2S B0063GORYU 5 1325289600 37 I expected a decent version of this game to waste time with once in a while, and this is it. No frills but it is just plain decent and exactly as expected, so it gets five stars
A1446RQ2MZIH2S B005ZTFPFQ 3 1331424000 52 Thought it would be fun, but was a bit disappointed. Ended up not playing it near as much as I thought I would, mainly because I am unwilling (yes, I am cheap) to spend the cash to get other games. After piddling with it for a few days, I just deleted it.
A144CSKS9ZR84O B004SBX112 5 1358985600 23 What can I say.  I'm addicted to this damn game!  It's a great way to pass time when your just relaxing at home.
A144CSKS9ZR84O B0064TVQ5E 5 1358985600 22 I'm not a Mahjong fan, but my wife is.  She plays it quite a bit and says she likes it a lot.
A144CSKS9ZR84O B004IALZTS 4 1358985600 21 I have to say for such a basic concept it sure is addicting.  I good way to pass time I guess.
A144CSKS9ZR84O B004SBS8LA 5 1358985600 21 What can I say it's another version of angry birds.  You kill the piggies and go on to the next screen.
A144CSKS9ZR84O B004SVMNXY 2 1358985600 36 I got sick of it in a hurry.  My daughter put this game on my Ipod, but after a couple days I deleted it.  It just got old to me and didn't do anything for me.
A144CSKS9ZR84O B008Y2FRFO 2 1358985600 21 I played it for several days and decided to delete it from my Ipod touch.  It got old in a hurry.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B007ZGO7EM 5 1358380800 23 this is a great little application. it comes in handy when checking homework or when you don't feel like fling calculations by hand.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B00DGXGNQ8 5 1372032000 24 this is an addictive game. it is very much like a computor game we have called peggle nights. for free, the price was right.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B0085VR7WU 5 1349827200 34 this game is addictive.  if you like yatzee you will probably like this game. I am conservative in rating games. and I am skeptical about 5 * ratings, but this game deserves the rating.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B00DHKKN6Q 4 1388707200 21 This is a cute bubble game. Good graphics and so far no glitches. The game is better on a bigger screen.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B008Y7SMQU 5 1359072000 33 I thought it wouldn't be a very good game, but was I wrong! this game is a lot of fun. everyone can get involved. you find you know more logos than you think.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B008LXN9II 4 1344643200 24 great game for children.  there are 3 ways to have the objects listed - picture,  shadow,  and words. good for children of all ages.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B00B99KJR0 5 1363651200 33 I love this game. I was hesitant  based on the number of reviews that had installation problems, but decided to get it anyhow. I am glad I did. I am enjoying the game.
A144E1IWQG1VSG B00A9JG6RS 4 1359158400 35 this game is addictive.  if you like bubble pop games you will probably enjoy this one also. only drawback is I cannot figure out why I am having trouble posting blitz scores.  lots of fun.
A144JCVG8KFETN B004H6WTJI 4 1369094400 21 Very convenient.  It's easy to use. This is most extensive online calorie database I have found so far; and it's free.
A144JCVG8KFETN B00CWY76CC 3 1386806400 76 More interesting and fun than I expected.  The object of the game is to find the clues that lead you to the tools to help you escape from the room, to get to the next level.  My only complaint is, once you're stuck there are no hints to guide you to find the tools to go to the next level.  Or there should be a show me feature that reveals the escape plan when you're stumped.
A144K2XKBFWV7D B004UMMWVY 2 1305072000 32 The plan may have been good, but the UI is terrible.  A complete UI revamp may help to get people accept this app. Colornote is a great alternative and it is free.
A144K2XKBFWV7D B004ZFK600 4 1309824000 44 This has been great on the nook!  Unfortunately I have started receiving messages regularly &quot;You have a call from #&quot;. They are usually spoofed or 866 numbers.  If I could set a filter only to allow my contacts, I would give this a 5*.
A144RB4FY9IA2G B007ZGO7EM 5 1357689600 29 It's bright, big and accurate! I love this calculator. It keeps calculations visible so you can remember what you're doing. Great app and I would recommend it to anyone.
A144RB4FY9IA2G B008D2QRAO 4 1362441600 26 I just started using this game and so far I find it to be fun and very interesting. Can't wait to see what else it has.
A144RB4FY9IA2G B00BHHIWQO 5 1391212800 29 I really like this game a lot. It keeps your mind focused and stimulated. I recommend this to everyone for fun as well as a fresh of breath air.
A144RFTE2P5MZY B004R13U6Y 5 1361836800 24 I have never had a tablet.  I think I like it because my friend said was easy to learn.  So far it has been.
A144SSUXZC8ENN B00820STKI 5 1338854400 20 We love it! Ever changing! Never boring! Perfect timing with July 4th just around the corner!! Thanks for the fun!!!!
A144SSUXZC8ENN B004Q3CJQ0 5 1338940800 20 A must have app with endless uses...came in handy when the electric was out one evening. Easy, simple to use.
A144UNDOOL2PTW B00BFUUMO8 3 1365033600 28 The concept of the game is great, but it hardly ever saves the game where you leave off and I've not seen an option to manually save it.
A144UNDOOL2PTW B004HXHVZ8 5 1360886400 23 I like the availability of digital copies since I can no longer watch any of my iTunes movies since their most recent update.
A144UNDOOL2PTW B009C7ZQM4 5 1393718400 22 I can't believe this all is free.  It cleans up memory and had to find files cluttering up your storage.  Must have.
A144UNDOOL2PTW B00GSZEBE2 3 1399334400 32 The game was working fine until I added the 11th level.  Now I cannot close a screen with the red X, I have to use the back button on the kindle screen.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B0080K98U0 2 1364256000 20 Downloaded it, didn't like the way it looked and deleted it. I never played it and neither did the kids.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B0087SGWI6 2 1355270400 31 some of this stuff was fun to do, but when another person uses the app, you lose all of your scores and keeping track of your progress becomes redundant.  Interesting challanges.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B007SYWFRM 4 1358899200 153 Simple concept, create a prehistoric village.  Amazing graphics.  Fun characters.  Expand your village using acorns or coins won by fulfilling certain requirements.  BEWARE!  You can also purchase additional acorns or coins, which can only be used in this game, for real money $$ up to over $30 just so you can expand your village.You can also play online and visit other villages of your friends or neighbors, we don't do this.My kids really enjoy this "game".UPDATE: This is quite a powerful game and it seems to have many glitches in it at the higher levels.  There have been a few updates since we originally downloaded it and now the game is hard to use because of the problems. (issues similar to trying to use your computer while it is also conducting a virus scan).  I have reported the problem and received a response but I am still waiting for a fix or update.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B007PTJOV0 3 1364256000 45 Very basic game, similar to early additions of Mario Bros.  My kids seemed to be entertained by it though.  However, after a relatively short period of time they stopped playing it to move on to the more challenging games.  Might be fun for younger children.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B009UX2YAC 4 1357603200 55 My kids were introduced to this game from their cousin.  It quickly became one of their favorites.  I have even tried it and can figure out how to use it.  I am not nearly as good as my kids but at least I can play without getting stumped like some of the others they have.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B00BGAZYLI 3 1365638400 86 This picture/word association game is a bit far fetched in what they have you try to do.  The pictures don't always help when trying to guess the word or concept.  My kids were discouraged very quickly.  I had a hard time with many of them and when I did get the correct answer it still made little sense to me at times how the pictures related to the word.  The game also needs some tweaking so you can move along if you can't get an answer.
A144VIQ7LR7KVF B00CHSPB8Y 4 1373328000 22 This game has great graphics, a 3D look and is fun and challenging to play.  Somewhat confusing to use in the beginning.
A144XXTXOAUEBQ B0058VW36U 4 1345161600 22 Its a fun game, good for when you have time to waste like when sitting in airports, subways, etc. Fun and challenging
A144XXTXOAUEBQ B00BJ7PY86 4 1405728000 42 Just like most other Mahjong games. Works as expected. If you like Mahjong you will enjoy this. Its not mahjongg the real game played in asia though, but the normal Mahjong matching game that most people play on their computers or phones.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B00CZDSK7K 5 1371513600 45 I am in love with this game! It's so interactive and fun. I love that you can play the roles of the family, and you have so much control over what happens. And its free! haha I love this game, so glad I got it.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B007Q3KX42 3 1348185600 38 its a great game, I love to play it. but it wont load and when it does it crashes! I wish this would be fixed so I could enjoy it :/ somebody should really try to fix it!!
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B008AYOLB2 3 1347667200 29 They're great songs, but a lot of them are played during the chorus, right when it's saying the title of the song, so it's really easy and kinds boring.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B008MM9630 4 1360108800 26 its a cute game. fairy farms good for little girls. my nieces never get bored with it. and its free, so I'm glad I got it.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B008Y7SMQU 4 1348099200 20 this is great but challenging. I love how it makes me think! :) I play it all the time now.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B009S980KG 4 1353628800 37 ya its interesting and fun, addicting even. don't like how long it takes to build things or how much money you have to spend to build things. ran low pretty quickly. other than that its really cool.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B007SYWFRM 5 1372377600 44 I love this game, most games likes this where you build your own city.. they charge money for a lot of things necessary to play the game. this one doesn't charge at all. its simple and easy to move along quickly in the game.
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B004GYY714 5 1348876800 24 this is the most useful app I've ever had. I love it! I always listen to it, it has so many cool features. &lt;3
A144Z8VWJFCM0K B0091REZMW 4 1359158400 29 its a cool game if ur into object searching but its kinda repetitive. my sister loves it so I keep it anyway, and play it sometimes when I'm bored.
A14505VRQRGNM7 B004UCO0FA 5 1402444800 27 Really like this bible app because I don't need to be online to use it. I can bookmark and highlight verses I want to go back to.
A1452509S611LL B004VMTI42 4 1326585600 55 this is an awesome browser that works faster that silk on the kindle fire. only thing that i don't like about is when you click on a link and quickly switch to a different tab it starts to load in that tab. but doesn't load in its original tab. other than that easy and fast.
A1452509S611LL B007XKEY6Q 4 1339459200 60 draw something is a great game. but one major problem is it takes forever to log into facebook proparly. basic logon screen but then it will ask to send emails and says facebook logon error. after several tries it works and stays logged in for a long time. thats the only thing that keeps me from giving it a five.
A1452509S611LL B0066T8M1I 3 1325548800 114 The app was titled Kindle Fire edition and then when ot was made free it went to just being called Monopoly. since it is still available on Fire its not very well been optomized. For example during game play the players money isn't aligned properly. And during trading when selecting a player to trade with you have to tap slightly below to select them to trade with. After you select them you have to tap sliglty below to select your items to trade with (on the left half of the screen). But the right side of the screen seems fine. Other then that you cant say much since it was free the other day.
A1453CXH1W1IL4 B0063GSL60 5 1325721600 33 Really nice graphics and game controls! I have no complaints AT ALL regarding the advertisements...well done and not intrusive like MOST apps! I think they're on to something... Enjoy this one, no doubt!
A1453CXH1W1IL4 B00B29PJGS 5 1378944000 44 For My First Impression, This Is Fun, Graphics Beautiful, EasyTo Use Interface And Delivers What It Promises!Wonderful FAOTD If It Must Be Another Game, At Least It Is Useful For The Mind!If Any Future Problems Are Found, I'll Adjust Rating, But For Now... Kudos
A1453CXH1W1IL4 B004VFJMYK 1 1389657600 56 Sad but true, used to be a very nice app. Without an update, it is not functioning as it should. Settings force close the app when attempting to change ANYTHING! -and mine is not a new phone! It should be removed fromed the market! Any developer who behaves in this manner should be censored by Amazon!
A1453CXH1W1IL4 B004YXE438 5 1312675200 31 Very nice app! I really have no problems with it....honest. It plays well, has beautiful graphics, well thought out levels of play...you will enjoy this if you enjoy putting puzzles together!
A1454A16WG8ZO B00GMSZCMK 3 1394841600 28 Both grandsons ages 5 and 13 love this game especially the 13 year old.  Once he starts playing he laughs I have to make him put it down.
A1454A16WG8ZO B009O2XY12 5 1388188800 20 It is a stress buster, simple caused me to laugh. Relaxing.  Grand kids were occupied for hours they love it.
A1454A16WG8ZO B00FAPF5U0 5 1388188800 24 candy crush saga is a fun game, very interesting something fun to do when just relaxing. Keeps me occupied with something fun to do.
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B00AE3J7PM 3 1358035200 353 I started up the game and was surprised that it was more of an elaborate &quot;node&quot; game than a space game. There is a pretty look to the graphics, but from a general playthrough, they are only shiny trinkets.The real game seems to be clicking on a node, going there clicking on an enemy, and waiting till someone dies. You can also click on a space station to repair yourself, so there are plenty of things to click on and do little with.There is a tutorial, integrated into the game by someone who doesn't understand the meaning of words like tedious, boredom, and engaging. You can read through the various topics and they're explained nicely enough, but you don't get the impact or use an in game tutorial would provide. I spent most of my time doing things and then reading the manual to see if I did it correctly.You are dropped into the world at earth in a typical starter ship. This is par for the course and fine, but then you are left with nothing. Are you supposed to chase the name around the game board that pops up occasionally, or do you just explore and click on pirates? I guess that is left to the player to decide, because there seems to be no story or reason for your adventure. My guess is that this game is a social game, made to be more of an interactive chat than an entertaining experience.I've never been a fan of mmos, but usually there is enough to hold me for a few days. However after a few minutes I realized the tutorial manual had more plot than the game itself and that clicking on things just isn't as exciting as the other reviews made this game out to be. I just do not enjoy mmos, clearly this is not my cup of tea. I suppose playing with friends and having them click on things with you would be slightly more fun, but its not enough to keep me coming back. Feel free to debate my points, but don't expect to win me over.
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B0064B3MG8 4 1358553600 27 The game is fun but it needs a better translation! its art style is like Castlevania. The thing kills my audio though, I can barely hear it!
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B007U8JRWW 5 1359244800 38 This app is great for viewing parts of the world I will otherwise never see. its fun and offers a look at interesting places! Its well worth a dollar. works smooth and responsive, and has plenty of cameras!
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B008GXHOFW 5 1353369600 55 If I'd known this would be on sale I would gave waited but I didn't. Trust me, thus game is amazing and great fun for a tablet game. I was reminded of the old spiderman the movie 2 game for ps2.  it takes a lot of memory but for a dollar, it is WORTH it!
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B0061S0A64 4 1352073600 69 a really cool game but it could definitely use an audio boost. it's rather quiet in my kindle fire, but the app is awesome so it doesn't matter. lots of options and it has a nice soothing sound too. I find it fun to keep putting nodes out and see when it finally crashes. it takes a while and even when its a mess, it still sounds like music.
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B0085PEG16 3 1354492800 113 As both a sci ti and Trek fan, I like the general set up of this game. The layout is smooth and Trekish and yet keeps enough originality that I don't feel liked I'm simply playing a knockoff. The tutorials are mostly very helpful, though they don't describe everything.However there is nothing else to do in the game. You can move in the galaxy but all there is to do is shoot ships. If a ship needs help, all you can do is help it destroy it's enemy. A story mode would help as would differing missions, such as scout, rescue, or exploration. Give us something to do besides fire all the time.
A1454Z4DL4PB9V B004HX4RT6 5 1352332800 94 As a faotd, this is great! Definitely a good chess game even if you have to pay. The game runs smooth and has a ton of options. However, the size of the board is a little small, and you can't name yourself or your opponent in Multi or Single player. There us another &quot;chess free &quot; game that lacks the options, but has names and a larger board. Both are nice apps. If you have the money, get this one, if not, get the other. Get one of the two though, these are great!
A1456KLVQ031E3 B00GRVV29E 4 1394582400 66 The magic that is within your mind will be enlightened.  The audio and video will take hold of your senses and show you how to relax.  You will be blown away by what this app can do for you and almost all of your family.  Each person young and old will have their own positive interaction, but be careful you may never get your turn!!!  :-)
A1456KLVQ031E3 B00HHBXYGM 5 1400544000 31 I really enjoy playing this game.  It is a great way to get you going.  It's not so difficult that it causes stress, just difficult enough to get your metabolism interested.
A1456KLVQ031E3 B0093QQAEM 5 1400371200 55 I am one happy happy girl,  this app is great.  I love nostalgia tv and radio, and this gives me more than I could hope for.  I'm not particularly computer savvy, so it's a learning experience.  I would say if you love your quiet time or are a nostalgia junkie, like me, GET THIS APP!
A1456KLVQ031E3 B007VUA7VO 4 1404172800 40 So far so good, I'm glad to have something to help me keep track of things.  I don't anticipate any problems.  I gave four stars only because it's still new to me.  I would download again if I had to.
A1456URRBN56FZ B008NABUU8 1 1350864000 22 I do not like this game because its so slow and turns off my kindle!!! don't buy it it a money waster
A1456URRBN56FZ B00821NZ74 5 1343865600 20 it is like I have a real human baby.  only if the stuff was less expensive I give it 5
A1456URRBN56FZ B006OCM13M 5 1345593600 28 August 23,2012 by: nianakellthis is the best game is a fun game where you talk to people and visit them decorate your store and make food.  BUY IT&#9733;
A145B009U45LMA B004I744AS 5 1367020800 26 Easy to download, easy to use. Plus there are quotes of the day, games and more. All this for free, cant get any better then that.
A145B009U45LMA B00FAPF5U0 5 1402099200 22 Addiction can be a terrible thing unless it's Candy Crush. Love this game. Even though some levels take me a long time.
A145B009U45LMA B0064X7B4A 4 1368403200 60 I love scrabble so this game satisfies my addiction. I got the free app but comes with a lot of commercial's. Might be willing to try the paid one. Also without even adding different people they show up on my game. Don't like that at all. Anyone know how to make that stop? Other then that I like the game.
A145B009U45LMA B008UXIDYE 3 1390521600 46 I use Bible Gateway on my home comupter almost everyday, looking up verses, where to find them. This app did not give me what I wanted or needed. Maybe it was me but I found it hard to find stuff. I hope others found it helpful.
A145LGNW2DZ7V3 B006IY163C 1 1324771200 82 This is the worst faotd, but would also be equally infuriating at $2.  You're paying to have an app that makes you pay for games within it.  To further the frustration, you can only find your &quot;9&quot; (actually far less as some are just repeats on another console) by searching through the list of all the other games you have to pay additionally to play.  Sorry, this is disgraceful.  Read up on this garbage before offering it in the future...free or otherwise.
A145LRXMI6VPBF B004VMTI42 5 1353456000 31 The speed is better than Silk and Opera, which is what I was using before. And it handles youtube's mobile site correctly, which I haven't seen Opera do despite three updates.
A145LRXMI6VPBF B0055SWM08 5 1334016000 25 The graphics, game play, and frame rate are all great on the Kindle fire. Introduces th basic concepts well and has a lot of variation.
A145LRXMI6VPBF B004O4K4SQ 5 1333065600 24 Kind of like Galaga. nice retro game. The controls are super simple. The upgrades are many and varied. The story is amusing. Good game.
A145LRXMI6VPBF B007PTJOV0 5 1333843200 40 I saw a bunch of 5 star reviews and I thought, &quot;these must be planted.&quot; But I downloaded the game anyway and it lived up to the hype! It's a Mario style platformer. It's very smooth and amusing to play.
A145LRXMI6VPBF B004RCHGRC 4 1337212800 20 Works fine on he kindle fire. Only four stars because sometimes I &quot;resign&quot; randomly from a game without any explanation.
A145P81P48NZLH B004DPCSKI 5 1404172800 133 Wow. I just had this app on and went into my kitchen when it went haywire with words and letters and warnings. It had red, green, yellow, and strange blue dots all over the screen. It was awesome. I really recommend this app. It is lots of fun and I am glad I got it :)Note: Review is from my daughter.  Thus far it seems to do really well, saying "Father" when I am in the room, and saying, "metal" when her Mom is in the room.  Her Mom had a metal rod in her leg when she was younger and it still messes up antennae TV signals when she is near them.  Thus this is a more interesting version then older ones I have been exposed to &lt;--This last part is me.
A145P81P48NZLH B0091REZMW 4 1387065600 33 Great game in all.  I find myself wishing though that you could go to collections that are ready  instead of having to go through all of them to find out what you need.
A145P81P48NZLH B00JTKDTLE 5 1399593600 26 This game is so much fun. It is very addicting and a great game to play. You can take turns trying to get the higher score
A145P81P48NZLH B00G922EA2 5 1386115200 43 It was a good story and a fun game.  I wish it wouldn't have ended so abruptly though.  Would have been nice to have a proper ending and beet the bad guy.Loved it though and it is renewing my faith in G5 games.
A145P81P48NZLH B0054JZC6E 4 1370217600 28 Fun game but takes too long to get points to open new games.  l would like it better if you got more points for rebeating games multiple times.
A145P81P48NZLH B00E8KLWB4 3 1384300800 23 Ok game but hidden objects are too small and hard to find due to the fact that they are sometimes hidden behind things
A145QW72A9X8HP B0071PARPA 5 1335657600 50 Sketch n Draw is my favorite drawing app... and it was free! Works great on my LePanII Tablet. I am able to get pretty good detail using my finger tip. Different pen 'styles' are pretty fun to experiment with. My 3 year old also uses this app and loves it.
A145SESX38ACRT B0067Q42BY 5 1329696000 22 Great adaption of logic puzzle and mystery story.  Great graphics.  Fun to play.  Variations can be set by user.  Keeps game interesting!
A145SESX38ACRT B004R49A4W 5 1335398400 104 Thank you Amazon!  This is a wonderful gift for your customers!  Beautiful high resolution photography makes downloads longer but it is worth the few extra moments.  The audio, and it's quality, add significant help when identification is required. The range maps add valuable insight to each species information. The choice exists to download all species library content to save on future connection times. Use on both my Motorola Xoom and Motorola Droid Razr with no problems or complaints!  I am an individual user - not connected with anyone associated with this product - so please accept my report as an honest review. Thanks again.
A145SESX38ACRT B006VW94HQ 5 1342828800 43 Interesting and fun. Looks like it might be a good application for young readers, as well as the more experienced. I'm not deep enough in any level to make a full assessment of the challenges ahead! Like others have said, it's addictive :)
A145UZHF9D9ZX5 B00A4EZ3QS 4 1380412800 24 this game if ok considering it is a knock off of candy crush. the instructions don't say that you can use groups of two.
A145VUZR7F19LE B00CHNKJFO 5 1382054400 135 Great Pinball game but the latest three tables cannot be bought.  It gives a notice that the latest patch must be applied. WHAT PATCH? The game updated to show the three new tables to be purchased so they should have included the PATCH in it. I would give a 5 star rating if fixed. P.S. These tables can be purchased in the Zen Pinball game with no problem but the Star Wars game version has additional features above just the tables in the Zen version.Now that the game has finally been updated I can buy the tables and they are all great. If your Kindle does not automatically update the program - go to the App Store and do a search for this game and when it appears it will say update instead of open.
A146751FDLTFW6 B004GFN11A 5 1369526400 32 If you like blogging on the go, you'll love this little app. You are limited to very simple edits of your site, but you can post to your heart's content. Nice app.
A146751FDLTFW6 B0066T8OH0 4 1369526400 20 This game is very well done... and at faster speed on higher scores, it will drive you nuts! Enjoy it.
A146751FDLTFW6 B008XAKC98 5 1371081600 23 This was a great investment. I don't watch much television, but if I am interested in something, I often find it on Crackle.
A146751FDLTFW6 B006QMYF0W 3 1371254400 27 I wish the cards were larger. The game-play is very good, but, it is somewhat weak visually. I'd love to see an update that fixes that issue.
A146751FDLTFW6 B005ZXWMUS 5 1371254400 47 I love to lie in bed and watch movies with this little Netflix app. I have not encountered a single bug in it. I log-in and add movies to the play list even when I am going to watch the movie through the Roku box and LCD-TV.
A146751FDLTFW6 B009WO7NQO 3 1371081600 20 I prefer the original and RIO. This one has several levels that are more annoying than entertaining. Buy the others.
A146751FDLTFW6 B004US4K2C 3 1375920000 33 This utility worked as expected. I toyed with it a while and didn't use it much further. I found that the Kindle standard interface was superior to this on a Kindle Fire HD.
A146751FDLTFW6 B004F1S6A6 4 1365811200 21 This is currently the best Twitter app on the Kindle Fire HD. It provides all the basic and it works reliably.
A146751FDLTFW6 B0093QQAEM 3 1400112000 27 The movies listed play flawlessly. There are not as many titles available as on some other apps, but, the list of movies includes a good many classics.
A146751FDLTFW6 B00FB13Y74 3 1399420800 94 I am not into the idea of having anything on my tablet that would allow people to buy something from inside a game. This game does just that. In fact, I did not intend to download this game. I tried to escape a prompt in another game (update of Angry Birds StarWars) and I was not happy that I could not opt-out of the prompt... an intermittent glitch, perhaps, but, I have since removed both games and deleted them from my Amazon account. Angry Birds games for the Blackberry Playbook do not do this.
A146751FDLTFW6 B008FRFN7A 5 1398729600 28 This app had me printing perfectly in less than a minute. It's FREE from HP. If you have an HP wireless laser printer, this is a MUST have.
A146751FDLTFW6 B004SDSSFY 5 1402272000 63 I needed an office suite that I can use for presentations. I have years of experience with Documents to Go, which makes this the natural choice for me. DataVis has done a great job porting this suite for just about every device I have owned. I recommend it for a bug-free solution to your office document needs when you take to the road.
A146751FDLTFW6 B00C2AMWVG 5 1369526400 128 I have the Kindle Fire HD and Blackberry Playbook, both. I have been waiting for Team17 to put out Worms (one of the series) for tablets and they finally have. I expected it since they have an iPhone/iPod Touch version. THIS IS IT! The game has not lost its charm. The funny voices are there. The silly antics are there. I'd love to see a multi-player option that is not exclusively an online game, but, this is better than no WORMS at all.If you have not played Worms Armageddon II, you owe it to yourself to play this game. I am not a gamer, but there is really ONE GAME that hooked me and reeled me in... Worms Armageddon. Worms Armageddon II will provide you with endless entertainment.
A146751FDLTFW6 B008K6HN8I 5 1360022400 20 I have used this to delete unwanted files from the Kindle Fire HD. Very handy, indeed. It's worth every penny.
A1467FEENNSPXQ B0063GORYU 5 1365465600 28 I have a lot of fun trying to win and making rows of kings.  You have to get all the kings free before you can build a column.
A1467FEENNSPXQ B00B2V66VS 2 1365465600 24 My nine year old grandson was telling me what to do, but I still couldn't get the hang of it.  I don't play it.
A1467FEENNSPXQ B008R9OIUO 5 1365465600 32 I recommend this to anyone who likes to find hidden objects.  It is not really easy.  You really have to look for some things which makes it challenging.  Good thing for hints!
A146984A02IXOL B009UX2YAC 5 1374019200 33 This is a fun game. You want to hit the play button over and over!I recommend it and I suggest you don't buy extra coins. You'll earn them fast enough. Great game enjoy!
A146984A02IXOL B006VW94HQ 5 1329523200 34 At first I thought the game would be too easy - but it gets progressively more difficult. Not really hard, but an interesting time - filler, and there are different ways to match words.
A146984A02IXOL B004HGK6FW 5 1327795200 117 This sudoku game is perfect for my kindle fire. It might have been the first app I bought (well, I didn't buy it. Because it was free). This is so good, however, I would have paid for it! I'm such a sudoku fanatic - every time I saw another puzzle book I bought it!! But now with my kindle fire it's so easy to play - no clutter or mess, and of course the kindle travels better. I just got my kindle fire in December, yesterday downloaded and installed the update, which makes it even easier to play - and if you're racing the clock - you can now play faster with update....I highly recommend this app!!!!
A1469V3Q0TPVIF B00ELMHHAE 1 1396656000 87 Sent an email to them yesterday because I got a message when I opened the app that I was already playing on another device. I explained that the app isn't played or installed on another device so how is this possible and how do I fix this? Their solution link it to FB or Google+. Really I'm sorry that isn't a solution cause if it happens again that will be their answer it is because it is linked of been through this before and know the routine.
A1469V3Q0TPVIF B004DM1OAQ 1 1355529600 41 First the game plays true then it cheats once the cube is doubled it throws doubles and manages to throw just what it needs for kills. I've played Backgammon for over 40 years I know a cheat when I see it!
A1469V3Q0TPVIF B00BYJ6BUO 1 1372032000 33 App. Doesn't work at all. All I get is a black screen. Tried two different shows same problem, removed from my Kindle HD. Will try again if it works I update my review.
A146ACEXJDYVV1 B005FQO096 5 1366416000 38 This game is fun and teaches the Bible at the same time.  It shows me that I know my New Testament fairly well but am sadly lacking in Old Testament knowledge. Shows I need to study the OT.
A146F287VCYOYY B00AK0X5VQ 4 1388016000 41 The levels progressively get more difficult, but it's a slow progression. As you become accustomed to one element or another, they add something new. It's not a groundbreaking game by any stretch, but it's great if you have time to waste.
A146F287VCYOYY B0071PARPA 4 1365292800 25 it does what its advertised to do. I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a quit sketch tool for use in a less professional environment.
A146F287VCYOYY B00CUWWLWG 4 1371340800 38 I find myself waiting on others a lot, and games like this keep me occupied for hours. This particular game has a couple of fun mini games built in that break up the monotony of most rpg types.
A146FV3CFJZY3M B0058KGXXU 2 1326758400 36 it was wierd i didn't understand it much it was a piece of crap it sucked more than anything u probably should do yourself a tabor and ignore it please do yourself a favor ! :P
A146FV3CFJZY3M B00529IOXO 4 1350950400 40 its really awesome but it dosent allways make a sound when u get a text. ocationaly it does but that's a while after u get a text sometimes it doesn't make a sound at all but beside that its amazing

A146H9ZF0SNKLW B004O3YGMC 5 1325808000 54 Not sure what I'm going to use this for, but it seems to do all it claims it can do. To me one of the better free apps Amazon has offered.  I have it installed on a Nook Color running CM7 and a Samsung WiFi 5 inch tablet.  Seems to work fine on both.
A146H9ZF0SNKLW B004XNGKBS 5 1317081600 60 I just installed this on my Samsung Galaxy YP-G70 and it seems to work fine.  Not sure when or how I will use it.  Nice to get a free app that's unique and not a game, since most of the games seem to just be a variation of another game.Update: Also installed and runs fine on Nook Color running CM7.
A146H9ZF0SNKLW B0055S348W 5 1316217600 138 This was a free App of the Day, but if you need to print from your Android device it would be worth spending the money to buy it.  I was able to print from my Nook Color running CM7 to my Canon ip4200 printer without a problem. I haven't tested the remote print, and not 100% certain how it works, but if it lets me print from my Nook Color to my Canon printer from anywhere that I'm online it will be the best thing since sliced bread. LOL  About time Amazon offered something other than a game or cookbook as a free app of the day.Next day update:The remote printing works.  My home computer and printer were on and I was able to print a PDF file from 5 miles away at McDonalds going through their WiFi.
A146JLLTCPUE0X B00HAS1AKY 5 1403568000 20 This is a great game. Can be challenging but not impossible. Need more coins to start with! I recommend it.
A146JLLTCPUE0X B00D57N4O4 5 1399680000 23 This is one of the best bingo games I've played so far. Simple but fun.  Lots of wins. Don't be afraid to try.
A146O8VWKSL3U1 B00CTMF4E4 5 1370044800 57 This app is 1 word: AMAZING! It's not like most makeup/makeover games where u just click the makeup and it magically appears on her face u actually put it on her face! There's a huge selection of hair also, tht is compared 2 most games. I think u should definitely get the app!!!!!!! Seriously like now!!!!! :D
A146O8VWKSL3U1 B00CRLSN4U 5 1377129600 20 Its a really good app to kill time and its super fun to play with my friends and family :3
A146O8VWKSL3U1 B008V06NRU 5 1361404800 33 I'm level 23 and I'm almost level 24 and I CANNOT STOP PLAYING!!!!!!!!! DOWNLOAD THIS RIGHT NOW!!!! U level up super quick in the beginning too. BUH BYE HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!! :D
A146PUNTSK0KHG B008PPGFZG 5 1346284800 34 they should have the real instagram on the kindle fire be cause I want it really badly and it is not fair that they only have instagram for only on the I pod touch
A146PUNTSK0KHG B00529IOXO 3 1348963200 22 I think this is a great app but I really want kik it is an app where u can also send messages
A146PUNTSK0KHG B008IJTFYW 5 1344556800 27 it puts you right to sleep and when you want to go to sleep and you can't. you can go on you're. kindle put the app.  :)
A146PUNTSK0KHG B008RKNG88 5 1346544000 22 they should have this app for free be cause it seems really fun n. I played this n it seems real fun
A146PUNTSK0KHG B004SOR4H6 5 1346457600 23 I love twitter its sort of like instagram but insta gram is better al though they should have the real instagram for free
A146PUNTSK0KHG B0090WZZ9A 5 1347667200 21 they should have this app for free be cause it looks really fun but then again it does not look fun
A146PUNTSK0KHG B005UOK2KY 5 1345507200 40 they should have this app for free be cause it seems really fun n I want it so bad be cause I love the annoying orange the annoying orange is so funny that I watch the videos al most everyday
A146PUNTSK0KHG B008J1ZVRY 5 1346544000 22 they should have this app for free be cause I really want it n the other temple run is kind of boring
A146PUNTSK0KHG B008RA3X5E 5 1347667200 20 they should have this app for free be cause all the other alarm clocks suckvn this one seems really good
A146PUNTSK0KHG B0093BM38O 5 1347062400 25 they should have this app for free be cause I really like play int jeopardy in real life so they should this app for free
A146RKXQ1KUELN B00BJQKQH6 5 1385251200 24 I'm so addicted to this game it's crazy...such good graphics and motion control for a free app. Works so smooth, I have no complaints
A146RKXQ1KUELN B00H59CTW6 4 1397865600 136 If you're not a patient person this probably is not the game for you. However if you're like me and have a thousand things to do and get distracted by then this game is worthwhile. I'm able to do other things on my kindle or just in life and since I get notified I know when my things are ready and spend a few minutes at a time playing, but to me it's worth it. It's a little of a challenge to save up for the things you want but I kinda like that. It's not the kind of game you play for hours on end but if you're into home designing games, the actual time you do spend playing is quick and to the point. Not my all time favorite but I enjoy it =]
A146RKXQ1KUELN B007U8JRWW 2 1385251200 73 Strange and creepy concept but at the same time kind of fascinating. It's cool to be able to see in all these random spots in the world. However it does make me very paranoid that I may end up on one of those cameras or that one day I may witness something horrible on it...which I think is what makes it addicting for me lol. But I have mixed emotions about this app..
A146RZUM5W8G8U B006S3HN6C 2 1328400000 28 I have really bad sight and small hands so I have to have my sister say what arrow is coming next, I'm upset with this app don't get
A146RZUM5W8G8U B006QZA1YI 5 1334102400 32 it is helping my sisters hand writing and inpruving  her knolage she loves this and so do i you should buy this app if you want to halp kids in youre family
A146S9JIX9Z1I9 B00F8H0LM2 5 1383436800 23 It is a very challenging game. I play it for hours and hours, as long as I have the hours to play it.
A146T2YL15W1P8 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1388361600 84 Like many other reviewers, I was hooked in seconds. This game has fantastic graphics. The creators did a great job building this multi-layered puzzle. It also utilizes the tilt function within the kindle, has speed tasks, memory tasks, matching and so much more. I love the continual search for clues to open the next box/portal/door etc. I'm really looking forward to The Room Two. But coming in late 2013 it says? Today is Dec 30th...late is here! If you want a challenge...look no further!
A146T2YL15W1P8 B00CWY76CC 5 1374710400 23 Wasn't sure what to expect but this is surprisingly riveting. Each level gets tougher to solve and I'm sucked in to the challenge!
A146T2YL15W1P8 B00IEBE7GK 5 1394236800 57 I absolutely LOVE this game.  My only regret is that is over too soon.  I really hope that Fireproof Games continues to do such a fantastic job and make more.  The addition of player profiles to #TWO was a great idea.  For those willing to part with a dollar or two, this game is worth every penny!
A146UUXYZCYYFH B00785P2QC 5 1395100800 33 The game is good, easy to play and a lot of choices.I always like this game, which they will make this one for pc as well.It's better to play in a bigger screen.
A146UUXYZCYYFH B005ZXWMUS 5 1395705600 38 this app is really good, just like the one that you use on the computer or tv.its same way to use it and its free.as long as your device has high resolution, you are going to enjoy it.
A146UUXYZCYYFH B00IG2DOKM 5 1405987200 18 great game, love it so far. it just takes long time to get all the products you need....
A146YVQ1OIL153 B00CWKYUSE 5 1400630400 41 The best game I've played in a long time! It has all the teams I like. It has all the new players and the past players which I like and when the teams get new players I can always update it!!!!
A146YVQ1OIL153 B00B55N4KM 5 1396396800 28 This is one of the best games ever but......IT WON'T LET ME PLAY ONLINE SINCE YESTERDAY!!!!!!!!!!!! I think you will like it so you should get it today.
A146YVQ1OIL153 B00H0BGCJK 5 1394496000 23 This is the best monster game u could ever find! I think that u should get this game. LOVE THAT IT IS FREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!
A146YVQ1OIL153 B009ZXT4BY 2 1363564800 23 It's fun but you only have 15  to plan. The bulls are super annoying and when you try to jump they get mad.
A146YXTY17LQ9T B00J05XSGY 5 1400630400 23 I absolutely love this game. this game is addicting because it's really fun. thanks for making this game I can't stop playing it.
A146YXTY17LQ9T B004K55CQ8 5 1399680000 38 I 100% love this game because you dress the boys and girls to how ever style you want. but you don't have many choices to choose from. well thank you for making this AWESOME game. I LOVE IT!!!!
A1471857L2G34X B0085E2LFA 4 1378339200 26 I love this gam I can do this for hoursIt keeps me going and helps with my coordinations of fingers and eyesWould recommend to all seniors

A1471OIFUACEFG B00A04GA14 1 1356739200 28 This is the worst game of all time. I prefer sword and magic games like Dungeons and Dragons anyway so this game is horrid and mainstream to me.
A1471OIFUACEFG B007V2UGPE 5 1358294400 27 This is a very fun and fantastic game good graphics good gameplay good everything and I think it might be the funnest game I've ever come scores

A1475L88UN9GW B007ZD17XO 5 1365811200 27 I have bought several games for my Kindle and I must admit this is at the top of my list for now.  So happy for this App.
A1475L88UN9GW B00GCI69D6 5 1393200000 44 I'm not sure why people had problems with this App. I find it so helpful and the graphics are beautiful. I love the application very much and would recommend it to anyone. This is why I gave it 5 stars. Give it a try...
A1475L88UN9GW B00BXL45G0 5 1392681600 46 I play a lot of bingo games and I can honestly say that this game is at the top of my list. It's fast paced and just plan fun. Trust me if you love fast and fun, you will love this game. 5 BIG STARS HERE...
A1475L88UN9GW B00IKZX1ZI 5 1397865600 141 I have to say that Frozen is so much fun. I do love Candy Crush and I know most of you do but to play this game is so relaxing and also a challenge. You can still buy lives and other things but if you don't the game doesn't take very long before you can play again. I love this game so much. There are very sweet character's that go with you with each level. I am still stuck on one level on Crush but little Odus keeps me happy with that game. Also you don't have to ask friend's to help you. This is a free app and I hope you will try it. I wish there were more game's like this one.  I believe everyone that tries Frozen will give it 5 stars like I did. :) :) :)
A1475L88UN9GW B00HYL0AAI 5 1396051200 39 I have never had a problem with this game. I have played a lot of slot games and of all of them I would give this one 6 stars if possible. As you can tell I'm a happy camper.
A1475L88UN9GW B00HKF00UI 5 1400371200 23 This is the best yet. PLEASE TRY AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED. I have tried many slots and I love this one. :)
A1475L88UN9GW B009ZS2B28 5 1389916800 61 I play several bingo games and I have to admit this keeps you on your toes. This is fast paced but also a game that keeps you challenged at the same time. Everyone should try it out plus it's free and that is the awesome part also. Kudos to the people who put this game together. Very happy bingo player.  :)
A14763JISRNYHD B00HFTHXMC 2 1403136000 21 Very much like all the other shoot and match three games available to play. Nothing new, or interesting in this game.
A14763JISRNYHD B00632HWOG 4 1396051200 29 I've had yahoo email for more than a decade, it's the best email I could ask for. Service is steady and always available for me, happy to recommend them.
A14763JISRNYHD B00AOA9BL0 4 1397692800 26 This is a good app, enjoyable shows, quality video, easy to use &amp; all on my schedule.  Like this very much, will continue to use it.
A1476TE9YR17N9 B008JGSM6G 4 1342310400 23 fun and addictive app. when you have nothing better to do. worth the down load. gets your mind going. I recommend this game.
A1476TE9YR17N9 B004DPCSKI 1 1339718400 29 might be worth having fun with on Halloween. c'mon I sure hope nobody takes this seriously. Just throws out random common words that anyone might relate to. Plain silly.
A1476TE9YR17N9 B0070Z89CY 5 1342483200 25 lots of fun. great to play on a flight to Vegas...gets you in the mood while reassuring that you will lose most of the time
A14781E6EK9N9B B00BS85W88 5 1368576000 28 This is an awesome game that is fun to play with my friends. The pictures could be a little bigger but other than that a really great one...
A14781E6EK9N9B B0080K98U0 5 1346544000 57 Well its a great way to kill time. And the story line is pretty epic. I'm not a fan of anime but it is cool. Has gameboy style graphics thought but isn't bad. Why don't you give it a try yourself and voice your own opinion. I give it 5 stars. Whatever you decide is your fate.
A14781E6EK9N9B B00846GKTW 5 1337731200 20 Awe its great! &lt;(^_^)&gt; You get to create a cool model too! Wow I have nothing else to say...... :D
A14781E6EK9N9B B009HKL4B8 5 1349481600 46 I like the game but that's just me. Its really addicting and really good. I just wish there were easier ways to get money cuz I cant play it 24/7 like it thinks you have to. Its a great game, just time consuming from making money.
A14781E6EK9N9B B008Y7SMQU 5 1347753600 33 Its okay. When you begin the game you have the feeling like you know the world, but its actually challenging. If you think its easy, its not. But is is really fun. :D
A1478YE02N0BJW B00BMH4GQE 5 1369180800 24 I love it. it messes with ur mind. Omb I love how some are easy and some are like wht the heak is tht
A1478YE02N0BJW B00CSR2J9I 5 1369180800 30 Omg I love this take si much I could not even stop playin.My whole family has this game and we all try l to bet everyone. LOVE IT SOOOOO MUCH.
A1478YE02N0BJW B00AEORXR0 5 1371772800 27 This game is soooooo amazing there is no way people will hate this game. It is not only to be campuses you get to meet new people
A1478YE02N0BJW B0097C8XL0 5 1362700800 30 This game is so much fun. I was getting tired of just playing Temple Run 1&amp;2.Until i got this game.I have not put this game doan since i got it.
A1478YE02N0BJW B00BG3ID0Y 5 1362873600 36 This game is very hard hut it makes you smarter.This game is very challenging and very fun to play.Ever since i got this game i have not been able to set it down.I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!
A147B38OGCA08O B004QEC2EI 1 1325462400 44 I got this and I thought it would be fun. But was not fun at all. They don't give you any clothes. They only give.you when you first get it one thing. The math ia easy as pie. I recommend this for little kids.
A147B38OGCA08O B005HB4F08 1 1325462400 56 I got this game for my daughter. She told me she hated this game. Its a waste of time for my daughter. Its a copy of Moran test. My daughter got that and she loves it. So I recommend you don't get this game. My daughter is 12. So I would get the Moran test instead...
A147B38OGCA08O B0061OACXO 1 1325980800 27 I don't like this nail salon game because when you are trying to paint the nails it goes all over the place. This is a terrible game!
A147B38OGCA08O B00769WNK8 5 1330300800 48 This app is so fun I was waiting for this to come on the kindle and.it finaly did this.game is so fun I could play this all day. I don't get why people say it doesn't work it.works fine. Don't listen to them this game is so fun.
A147B38OGCA08O B005HSL626 5 1325635200 31 I got this for my daughter,and she is 12. She loves this game. I don't agree that people say it is a bad game because its a great game!!!! :) :)
A147B38OGCA08O B007OXASB2 5 1335398400 30 This one of my daughters favorite game. Especially because she loves to care and be responsible for animals. My daughter is right this is a very fun and interesting game.
A147B38OGCA08O B008JGSM6G 5 1343520000 21 This is a great app for the kindle fire so much fun. everyone should love this game. Have fun playing it!
A147B38OGCA08O B006GG1KOC 2 1326326400 22 This was to easy. It was way to short I wish it was more and harder. Didn't like this game at all.
A147B38OGCA08O B006OBWGHO 3 1325635200 32 Its not one of the best games but I think it is ok. I got it for my daughter she said she liked it a little. Shes 12. It was just ok.
A147B38OGCA08O B004HM35RC 5 1325462400 32 This game is amazing. Its so cool. This is the best game ever. I love this. Don't listen to the people that don't like this. You will be addicted. to this game.
A147B38OGCA08O B007Q3KX42 2 1334102400 42 This game didn't work for me it crashed right away! This is not my favorote game. So whenever I try the play the game it just goes black and goes back to screen so I don't recommended this for your kindle fire
A147B38OGCA08O B004N2NWQ0 1 1325635200 23 The last part it says to flip when I flip it it does not turn green on the kindle fire. fix it plz.
A147B38OGCA08O B00689PMD2 4 1325462400 69 So people say this is bad but this good for ages 10 and up. The reason I say that is because so little kids aren't ready for a boyfriend. They wont like it because she is half naked. I love this game I am 12. This game is amazing. But can be boring at times. If you dont like fashion then this is mot a good app for you.
A147B61MA8LNRB B00DGEB2XG 5 1376697600 28 If there ever was a game that got me hooked it's this one.  It is challenging and so much fun.  Looking forward for other levels to come out
A147B61MA8LNRB B0092S4WLY 5 1376697600 20 This game is addicting and challenging.  I couldn't put it down.  Looking forward  for the next levels to come out.

A147EIV8DZG50I B0060D80NU 5 1345334400 38 I am having so much fun building my island resort. it has a good balance of money earned for the things you buy so that you can save up for more buildings and things. I highly recommend it!
A147EIV8DZG50I B0060I3IJG 5 1356998400 51 This app allows me to get online and find inspiring, beautiful websites that are geared toward my interests. Ever gone online and thought, &quot;what do I look up?&quot; Or, &quot;why cant I find anything interesting?&quot; This website is your answer. It is my guide to the Internet and I love it!
A147EIV8DZG50I B004UBH4S6 5 1348099200 20 if you want an app with good, straightforward horoscope, get this one! I love it and use it a lot.
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B00992CF6W 5 1362873600 30 this game is so much better than any other kindle or computer game I have ever played in my life. its like living a whole new life except in minecraft
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B00E7VV2RS 5 1384905600 24 This game is pretty much like clash of clans but it is in 3D which is awesome because Amazon doesn't have clash of clans
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B008GWPEQ4 4 1344643200 20 this game is great the only problem with big win games are you don't get to play them at all
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B008Y2FRFO 5 1349049600 27 best game ever it entertains you for hours on end unlike the real game you don't have to waist all your loose change and still don't win
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B008TY8PKG 4 1345939200 21 a great challenging game that requires lots of time and smarts while having a ton of fun and loads of pleasure
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B0063GSL60 5 1350777600 27 This is a challenging game., and it's customizable for even more fun. This is just like the version on my old notebook computer except with more features.
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B008YW5RH2 5 1398038400 21 This is a game for tennis fans who want to play a really good game with many game modes and players
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B0097M6WDG 1 1350604800 24 I wish there was a zero star beacause this is too inappropriate for anyone except ADULTS should not at all be used by kids!
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B008183CTE 4 1344643200 24 the game itself is great but it when your the home team you bat first even though the road is supposed to bat first
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B009WO7NQO 5 1352505600 27 great game for angry birds fans star wars fans and anyone else completely worth $2.99 great game I played it for hours you must get this game!
A147H9ZDFJUS3J B0066T8JRK 5 1347148800 20 this app is awesome it lets play and it's like playing The Game Of Life. You must get this app
A147I470CGAHTD B00HAS1AKY 5 1394928000 30 This game is awesome, brain power mixed with younger days memories. It takes you back to the days when everything moved a little slower and you had time to relax.
A147I470CGAHTD B00A1SL8SE 5 1359590400 22 This is a completely awesome game, love the graphics and music, they work great together. Can't wait for more levels to conquer!
A147I470CGAHTD B00B2V66VS 4 1360108800 20 Awesome sequel to Temple Run, but needs a lot of the bugs worked out! Otherwise I won't stop running on!
A147KCAX8PXWTL B00AHNC0SK 4 1396569600 21 This game is really fun. It has great graphics and fun quests. Take  it from me, you want this game!! :D
A147KCAX8PXWTL B00AREIAI8 4 1363478400 31 This is awesome! It is soooooo life like and is so fun to play! I LOVE this game! The only downside is the ads that pop up but otherwise is amazing!
A147KCAX8PXWTL B007SYWFRM 4 1363478400 29 This game is so much fun, but it takes forever to go up level by level after level 15.... otherwise it is awesome. There are so many neat features!
A147L94BGKUMC4 B005HSL626 5 1331942400 41 This game has great graphics,sound effects,and cool extras.You can change the background,and the design of your blade.It works really great on the kindle fire.This game deserves four stars,it is not a waste of your time,trust me,my whole family loves this game.

A147L94BGKUMC4 B0073V0FC2 5 1331337600 83 This game to me is really fun,and if you kids are waiting somewhere or are really bored you should download this app,it is is really fun and I am addicted to it after one try.It is not a badge game, I am thirteen and I really love this game,it has great up to date graphics, and everything else.This game works great for my kindle fire, no problems at all.The character you play with to use to eat the fruits he is really cute.
A147L94BGKUMC4 B004GVYXTS 4 1331942400 28 This game is fun for all ages but it gets boring after a hour or so.I like this game,I usually play it when I am bored to death.
A147L94BGKUMC4 B0070O973K 2 1330732800 23 This app gets so old fast,at first its fun but when you play it again it gets boring.All you do is polish poop.

A147LMNV3CF2R0 B006D1ONE4 5 1329868800 20 I have a lot of apps on my kindle fire out of all my apps this is my favorite! !
A147LTJFMTJOD6 B0050KDTSK 4 1328227200 25 I love this game but now it has &quot;stopped unexpectedly&quot; grrrrr now my crops are gonna be dead so if you get this app beware
A147LTJFMTJOD6 B0086700CM 5 1339977600 23 I love this game I waited forever for amazon to get this app and I am so happy that they finally got it:-D
A147LTJFMTJOD6 B0070O973K 1 1329868800 47 This is one of the most stupidest games I have ever got right after I played it I uninstalled it. you are just shining a pile of poop it is a waste of time and completely stupid and once again one of the stupidest games ever made
A147LTJFMTJOD6 B006OCM13M 4 1330128000 29 this is just like the other &quot;story&quot; game but the people act Like the whole world has not eaten in a year and they all come to my bakery.
A147LTJFMTJOD6 B006MH1A1S 2 1329868800 45 this was a fun game but I guess I should have read the other reviews because I got to the 3rd level and now I cant go any further because it wants me to buy the full $4.99 version ugh I hate games like this!!!!!!!!
A147LTJFMTJOD6 B0081IWNYO 1 1341446400 31 if you want a talking app get the droid talker app it has a real key board and is much better than this app don't get this one get DROID TALKER
A147VEMLMX7ENW B0088QGB7Y 5 1375228800 33 I love this game it's awesome I can't get enough the only bad part about it is that it costs money to get the stuff I want but I would still get this
A147VYJZV1LIWU B00B03IY90 4 1383004800 22 Couldn't stop til I finished. Great graphics and story. Not to hard but also not boring and sleep enducing or mind numbing.
A147VYJZV1LIWU B00E8KLWB4 4 1392681600 21 I really like this game but I'm wondering  where the update for kindle is. There is already one for  other tablets.
A147VYJZV1LIWU B008JJ7XYK 5 1384992000 25 I love this game. I even have it on my phone. The only problem is its highly addictive. Don't bring it to work or school.
A147VYJZV1LIWU B00FEMJF6O 4 1398211200 37 This game is great. The quests are well thought out so some can be completed quickly and some can be completed over time. I would have given it 5 stars if the in app purchasing worked correctly.
A147WFSJW1SJ B0091REZMW 3 1404086400 22 It's been awhile since I downloaded and deleted this game.  I apologize for not remembering why I just didn't like it much.
A147WFSJW1SJ B00HTKA4N2 3 1404086400 41 I went back and found this one after I had already found and played and solved #2.  This one wasn't nearly as great as the sequel.  I was greatly impressed with the huge improvements made from this game to it's sequel.
A147WFSJW1SJ B00881VLCE 5 1385510400 20 These are true jigsaw puzzles.  I like them.  Was among the first I tried on my kindle and got hooked.
A147WFSJW1SJ B007BUITZU 4 1385510400 20 More game of placing pieces versus true jigsaw puzzles where you can rotate pieces.  There were lots of cute pictures.
A147WFSJW1SJ B00D57N4O4 3 1385510400 34 I've only played it a little.  It keeps asking to spend money for things I wasn't clear what the benefits of using them were.  I only won 2 times out of many tries.  Annoying.
A147WFSJW1SJ B00BYJ6BUO 4 1385510400 20 I only used once so far.  From what I remember, I wasn't happy with the limit of available episode selections.
A147WFSJW1SJ B0062X7QWO 4 1385510400 26 It's more of a game deciding where each piece goes versus a true jigsaw puzzle.  As you go up in the levels, the pieces get tinier.
A147WFSJW1SJ B005LJXR6E 4 1385510400 34 It's mostly a game trying to rearrange pieces to make the picture.  Higher levels = smaller pieces.  Even though you complete pictures and open levels, there are no more pictures available in each level.
A147WFSJW1SJ B00GGQLZUG 5 1404086400 64 I really love this.  I seem to be able to play this game for a long time.  The only down side was when I was trying to free up memory space on my device and sent it to the cloud, I didn't realize that I lost all my progress and coins, etc.  It's a good way to have fun pretend gambling without losing money.
A147WFSJW1SJ B00JFYY2OC 1 1404086400 56 I only got through 2-3 doors and then just couldn't get any further in the game.  Nothing came up regarding any in-game purchasing as far as I can remember.  I deleted it after a few days of trying to progress.  Maybe I am just clueless and others would be able to figure out how to progress.
A147YT13XQIV52 B008DYK0I2 5 1368144000 32 I love this when I am in a situation when I am away from home and want to catch part a game I wanted to watch.  It's quick and easy to use.
A1484PMVJSJDT B006OCM0G0 5 1331164800 22 fun and addicting. not a fan of buying.  but still fun. you don't. have to buy extras to still enjoy this game
A1484PMVJSJDT B006R6VG9K 4 1325721600 24 I love this game. I play this game on my Pc. It as much fun to play on my kindle. I highly. recommend. it.
A1484PMVJSJDT B00A4034W2 5 1398729600 27 I love this game. I have played it over 3 times. I wish I could move up higher. Limited amount of levels. But a lot of fun.
A1485C9GUYPLPZ B0097GVJWQ 5 1348876800 20 it ran perfectly on my kindle, and the story didn't suck, as they usually do in these types of games.
A1485K263M7RDG B007OXASB2 5 1339200000 20 Super fun game to play.  Not a dull moment.  I would recommend this game for all ages.  Have fun playing!!!
A1485K263M7RDG B006PH7WBM 4 1340064000 22 Super fun game!!!  I would rate it 5 stars if the the stuff was less expensive.  I still love playing it :0)
A1485K263M7RDG B0067Q4RCI 3 1336953600 24 Waste of money.  Bought game last night, &amp; beat it this morning.  It is fun to play though.  Just stick with the free version.
A148R8B9FEGSKL B004MC8CA2 5 1336348800 30 love the fact that I can listen to the Bible plan. I work as a cleaner late nights so being able to hear the word of God is a blessing
A148R8B9FEGSKL B00CKW6FVE 5 1370044800 79 If you like tetris this is a must! Warning, the games gives you alot of in game currency to enjoy yourself at first and get a really hight score. But once the currency runs out it will be hard to beat your high score untill you fork up real cash to buy coins, to get power ups, so you can get high scores again. Other than that if you like challange of creating rows then this is awsome game!
A148R8B9FEGSKL B006OC2ANS 5 1333843200 24 If you put in the time you can get good enough equipment to do well. Lots of depth for a free to play fighter
A148RZBCKP87K9 B0080K98U0 4 1377820800 36 I think th game is very good and very addictive it's a little slow at first but you will . And you will like it very very muchlike it once you get the Hang  of it
A148RZBCKP87K9 B00B7AIZOA 4 1371254400 62 It is very awesome I just wish I knew how to draw lol but if you into art you should get it the downside you have to have wifi in order to use it but besides that it is very cool app to haveAnd anyone can get it ans use it to their advantage to improve their skills in this area and
A148TWTLXW1X71 B00BMW6ER8 5 1392336000 23 Bingo Cocaine!!!!! one round and your hooked! Have yet to see a better app. May I be an addict with no possible recovery!
A148TWTLXW1X71 B00AMEFZ72 5 1374796800 21 favorite all time bingo game! you'll never get bored playing this. ROCKSTAR BINGO!!!! can't get enough! keeps you anxious for more.
A148TWTLXW1X71 B00E5GJ7QS 1 1375574400 25 fun, keeps you wanting more. numbers come fast so be watching or you'll waste your bingos. the more frustrated I got the more I played.
A148TWTLXW1X71 B00CTN0ALA 5 1384992000 30 If you like Texas Hold em' and interacting with the other players then this is the App you want.  In fact its the best one I've ever used. Highly recommended.
A148TYIVIROXWF B00JBNS6KS 5 1400284800 49 I really like this game, it's not your run of the mill match three game. I think this is one of those game that you either like or don't like immediately. Luckily, it's super easy to play and if strategy is your game, I think you'll like this one.
A148TYIVIROXWF B004HEORNQ 5 1338681600 45 I like this App! I like that I can use as many characters as needed to get my point across without worrying about the 140 character limit. I don't take it for granted but there are times when you need just a few more characters.
A148TYIVIROXWF B005CRCP36 5 1327363200 30 I read the proverbs daily and they always seem to inspire me to be a better person. I also have the daily Bible passages app, both are quality apps. Recommend!
A148TYIVIROXWF B0067Q42BY 5 1329609600 28 I love this game! I've played and deleted many Mahjong games but this one is def a keeper. Thanks for making it the free app of the day!
A148TYIVIROXWF B0064X7B4A 5 1351468800 21 Please create Hanging With Friends for KFHD. I have just about every &quot;with friends&quot; game u make. Really would LOVE Hanging.
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B00869G6LY 5 1389225600 35 I turn this scanner on when I am on my way to work...as a Paramedic/Firefighter..and I know if my unit is on a call before I get there...it's pretty cool. I recommend it for sure.
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B00A4EZ3QS 5 1372464000 20 This is a fun game. I love seeing all the candy. It's not really a challenging game, just fun. Thanks
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B00BGAZYLI 5 1372464000 28 I love a challenge and this one is not TOOO tough but there are times when I just can't guess the word and have to call a friend~
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B005YIPHL0 5 1339372800 23 every morning I read my prayers and blessingsI feel so good and hopeful duringthe day. I share this every day w my boyfriend
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B007U8JRWW 4 1344297600 24 this is so cool. technology is amazing and whoever knew you could spy in so many countries. I have been.spying all over the world!!
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B004UMLBCA 5 1343088000 35 have been on ww several times and tracking food was such a chore that I didn't do it. now w this apparently its Sooooo ez and I track every single morsel! ! thanks so much!!!
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B00FAPF5U0 5 1389225600 39 I love this game. I hate this game. I have deleted it 2 times from my phone but I cannot get enough of it. Whoever invented this game did a great thing and is really banking it!! Good job!
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B004FRX0MY 5 1357862400 20 Yep...love this player. Works great! Amazon is the best. I can find anything I ever need and love seeing reviews
A148ZCC0FGZ67K B004VS0JPI 5 1357862400 21 I am in the medical field and find this to be a great app. It works amazingly well. I love it
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B00CELIPL4 1 1381017600 54 A simple hidden object game should not require internet access to play! I read the reviews, bought it (FAOTD), turned off my wireless and tried to play it. It would not open. I will delete it within less than 10 minutes of downloading it without finding out if it was worth playing or not.
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B00E4WVYR8 1 1401408000 29 I love this game and would keep it, but I am removing apps with invasive permissions. Why does a simple puzzle game need read only access to my device?
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B00DGXGNQ8 1 1373932800 24 This is a cute game and could be addictive, but there are to many adds even for a free game! I am deleting it!
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B00AKKTDJY 2 1380067200 23 I love the game. It is great fun but... on numerous occasions the game has started on its own!!! I am deleating it!
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B008XME36E 3 1372032000 86 I really like this app. It works very well on my kindle fire hd 8.9. It has a good selection of free books every day. I like that it allows you to select the kinds of books you want to see. WHAT I DO NOT LIKE IS THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A WAY TO OPT OUT OF EROTIC LITERATURE WITHOUT OPTING OUT OF ROMANCE!!! If they would add this option I would give it a 5 star rating and feel that it deserved 6 stars.
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B007A6K2GY 1 1381449600 35 I don't know how good or bad this app is and I am not going to find out! A simple puzzle game should not require internet to play! I will delete without ever playing it!
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B008Y212PI 5 1382227200 75 I really enjoy this kind of game and was really happy to find that it worked without wifi! I had read some recent (Sept./Oct. 2013) reviews which said you had to be connected to use it. If that had  been the case I would have had to decide if I liked it enough to ignore such a blatant disregard for my privacy in a simple puzzle game. I am sure I would have deleted it!
A1491IH1HTYGOZ B007EC27QM 1 1382140800 36 The free version is better because it does not need the Internet! I'm glad it was the FAOTD! Why does the paid one need intenet? Who needs internet for a basic calculator? I am deleting it!
A1491OAMSCEHR8 B00AVGGYNA 5 1389225600 51 This game is fun and doesn't make you wait for new game. I love that when you bingo you get a good return,causing me to judge  this bingo game the best I've played yet! Pay day I'm buying more coins so I can play longer!! Thank  you for this good game.
A1491OAMSCEHR8 B00BMW6ER8 5 1396915200 26 This game keeps me playing, not stingy with rewards. Don't have th spend money to play! I've told my family a d friends to download it!
A1491X1QOLGE1B B00FAPF5U0 5 1399939200 20 I tried this game because so many friends were sending requests and now I'm addicted to it too! Love it!
A1491X1QOLGE1B B006U0Y07I 5 1327017600 23 The simple instructions, ease of navigation and great graphics make this game fun to play without a lot of complex steps to learn.
A1491X1QOLGE1B B006JPS1OM 5 1346371200 21 This game has puzzles, hidden objects, and multistep problem solving games all in one. It's a great game,  multifaceted and engaging.
A1494N203T4R49 B008DYK0I2 4 1401926400 27 What an improvement.  Been watching for years, I used to get stuck in the twilight zone.  This tennis freak is in hog heaven.  Thank You  Jan H
A1494N203T4R49 B007P8BMTS 5 1370563200 38 LOVE  the app have to watch some shows more than once.Hate the blasting commercials. Bury the Kindle under a pillowFaster  to bury than turn down for commercials and up to watchMy  CW  Favorites.  Thanks for  the app.  Jan
A149714NFGOURS B006M4F67A 5 1330819200 21 Very relaxing, and challenging  gamess, with enough puzzles to entertain you for hours! I reccomend this game to all mahjjong lovers.
A149714NFGOURS B008IJT0CE 5 1348531200 32 I particularly like the Zen it is great for meditating and getting centered. This program has many sounds that are very relaxing and I recomemd it highly.  Definately a five star program!
A1497HFMV6VMGL B0099AQQPK 1 1359590400 21 just not my cup of tea not fun just wish i had something else to play so sorry about this game
A1497S8PIE636X B005V1N71W 2 1390435200 26 I should have known, Pandora is not available in asia. The app probably works great.....elsewhere..... or with a U.S.VPN. Sorry to disapoint you my fellow expats.
A1497S8PIE636X B00DZYXTRY 5 1402531200 42 Like stack the countries, this app is great fun. My 7 year old loves it and is learning states and capitals with ease. Adults find it fun too. A must for anyone who wants to know about the country we live in.
A1497S8PIE636X B008L1A68Q 5 1402531200 52 ....that's why i'm writing this review. She is, dare i say - addicted to the thing. I hope the battery runs down soon so i can speak to her.Its also fun , and educational for kids. My wife and daughter play each other all the time. Yes, its like scrabble, only free!
A1498BLLXI6EQ9 B009G9KFQ0 5 1374019200 119 I used to use The Weather Channel App because it was so straight forward but they made some BIG changes to it and it's not as user friendly anymore (more news less weather). With THIS app the at-a-glance information is super easy to navigate and the drill down details really make this app stand out.I really like being able to see the breakdown of the days by the hour to really get a feel for not only what the best days of the week will be but also what times of day will be best for being outdoors, etc. Being able to see the severe weather alerts is a must also so I really appreciate that feature as well.
A1498BLLXI6EQ9 B0094BB4TW 5 1356307200 21 The Facebook App is pretty easy to navigate and I really like being able to access it quickly to stay connected.
A1498BLLXI6EQ9 B004S2W37O 4 1360195200 22 I like having my planner, shopping list and dinner recipies/ideas all in one place so this is a great tool for that.
A1498BLLXI6EQ9 B006SMLAMQ 3 1358726400 22 This app is slow and not very user friendly to change locations & settings. I think there are better apps out there.
A1498BLLXI6EQ9 B008910NAO 4 1356307200 21 If you enjoy solitaire (any kind) this is a good app. Easy to use and fun to play anytime of day!
A1498BLLXI6EQ9 B004SJ3AXI 5 1356307200 27 My kids LOVE Angry Birds so this is a great app for car trips or anytime they may need help chililng out. It also helps with strategizing.
A1499R6R9QZKX7 B006P2Y2QK 5 1380067200 28 A nicely done app of everyone's favourite time waster.  This is a very easy to use app which has good graphics and pleasing sound features.  I recommend it.
A1499R6R9QZKX7 B0062R5GJ0 3 1363219200 31 I found this calendar app to be useful for my needs but a bit awkward for me to navigate.  It may just be my unfamiliarity with the mechanics of the app.
A149BNB9P1I7N4 B006M4F67A 5 1369008000 22 Great fun to play and looks good. I like it a lot but this sixteen words is not any fon at all.
A149C145N5FYA5 B004HGK6FW 5 1354492800 26 Simply put: this is the best Sudoku program for the Kindle Fire.  I tried several others, but ended up deleting them after I found this. one.
A149C145N5FYA5 B00AAX68HG 4 1357862400 65 This is a fun novel game, but it is not extremely difficult.  It is fairly easy to complete all the levels offered so far, hopefully they will add some more challenging levels soon.  But all in all, it's a very fun game.  If it were a tad more of a challenge, it would definately rate 5 stars.  Cut The Rope is still much better though.
A149C145N5FYA5 B004V5PW4Y 3 1311206400 37 Love the game, but computer gets too many rolls where all 6 dice score, way more than should happen statistically. Then today, the computer farkled EVERY TURN - 21 times in a row! Something is wrong here.
A149C145N5FYA5 B008N8IV2U 5 1346025600 64 One of the most challenging and best games I have played on my Fire.  Don't believe the whiners who claim that this level or that level don't work.  They obviously do not understand the solution to that level.  I (as well as many others) have solved every level, some are extremely tricky but they are solvable.  There are no bugs, as some have complained.
A149C145N5FYA5 B0067Q42BY 5 1378252800 59 Disregard the reviews that are critical because it has ads.  There are no ads in the game, only a splash screen that shows other available games.  Just click Play and you are on your way to the best Mahjong game ever published.  Awesome graphics and music plus 3 different ways to play.  It doesn't get any better than this.
A149C145N5FYA5 B004VMTI42 5 1334534400 37 I love my Fire but I have never liked the browser that came with it.  Now there is an option for Fire users and it is incredibly good.  This is a must have app for Fire users!
A149C145N5FYA5 B0086700CM 5 1338854400 33 The BEST game available for Android.  Perfect for the Kindle Fire.  I have been waiting a long time for this to be available for the Fire &amp; I am not disappointed at all.
A149HETB53WOFO B006VW94HQ 5 1342828800 23 Nice to play a game that uses my mind. Enjoyable way to pass the afternoon or evening!Give it a try, you'll be hooked!
A149HETB53WOFO B00FEIX5OG 5 1389571200 44 I enjoy one player games, as they allow me to unwind. This game  allows me to stretch my mind while relaxing my body. As a insomniac, this game is far more entertaining that the informercials running in the wee small hours of the morning!
A149HETB53WOFO B0087HEQ6M 4 1338768000 23 keeps the little ones busy. game 's a little simple for older kids but they enjoyed it as well. overall, a good game.
A149I2WQQN2385 B00CAM8YL8 1 1391472000 21 would not work on my Kindle Fire so I will delete it.....and keep trying for something else in this general area
A149I2WQQN2385 B004UCO0FA 4 1367020800 26 I am so happy with this Bible. It is real easy to get from book to book while the Preacher is throwing out verses while preaching.
A149I2WQQN2385 B0054QY36C 4 1341878400 58 I must be one of the lucky ones. My app works great and is working for me. The graghs and arrows show me every day if I am staying on track. I have tried  other apps and could not get any where. So I am happy with my app and happier with my weight lose since getting it.
A149I2WQQN2385 B006J2EG6M 5 1337990400 22 I really get into this game. It helps with my vocab and to really think I know that many words is cool.
A149ICTMKGDNNC B00AECGQF2 4 1356220800 160 This is one of the best Apps I've ever purchased for our Kindle. Each one of my kids enjoys it and they vary in age from four up to eleven. My four year old though literally has to be peeled away from playing this. She sits there with a huge smile on her face while giving the characters silly hairstyles. The game lets you do all sorts of things to the hair, cutting, growing,curling,straightening,shampooing,rinsing,blow drying, towel drying,coloring,adding accessories, and taking pictures of all your wonderful creations to laugh about later.The only reason I took one star off is that it would be nice to have more characters included. I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that option. I also think it would be really great if they had makeup you could apply as well.All in all though this is an awesome app for younger kids and really anyone. Okay I admit I find it kind of amusing myself!
A149ICTMKGDNNC B009C7ZQM4 1 1376006400 59 I don't know what happened but after downloading this app my Kindle starting acting crazy. I thought that the app couldn't be the issue but nothing else had changed. I deleted this and things seem to be okay now. I really don't understand what might have happened and I'm bummed because I really thought this app would be great.
A149ICTMKGDNNC B008JK6W5K 5 1344556800 24 this game is simple yet challenging. great time waster that my entire family loves to play. some are foreign and require a little research.
A149ICTMKGDNNC B00AQR3QN0 2 1360108800 393 I must start by saying that my four year old daughter absolutely adores this app. I think it's cute and can see why she likes it. Had this app cost 1.99 from the beginning I would've been totally ok with it. However this app is by far the most ridiculously overpriced app I have ever seen.You start out with the "free" app. What you get is just one character to dress and a VERY limited amount of things to dress her in. All of the other choices are locked. This is where you must be sure to have you settings in place to prevent kids from unknowingly racking up tons of in app charges. Let me tell you they could do some damage in this overpriced app.If you want to unlock more characters or even just outfits to use you buy different "packs". Each pack is either a certain character and a few of their outfits or a themed pack like princess. The kicker is each of these packs is another 2.99. So for 2.99 you get only one more character and a couple of outfits and shoes. Because my daughter likes this so much and because I am clearly a moron I have purchased quite a few of these packs. I believe this "free" app has now cost me around twelve or fifteen dollars. This is astronomical for an app and I'm mad at myself for even paying it. I wouldn't in a million years paid that much for this app up front so I kick myself for doing it after the fact.I think the company that made this should be ashamed of the pricing. Yes I realize I am the idiot paying the prices but that still doesn't make it right. It's not like it's some kind of super high tech type of app either. It's just a simple dress up thing.So try it if you have a little Strawberry Shortcake fan but be prepared for them to be begging for you to purchase these packs. If I could go back I just wouldn't have gotten the app at all. Again if this app would've been two bucks to start out with then I would've given it a five star review. I'm only giving it two because my daughter loves it so much. I'd really like to give it zero stars.
A149ICTMKGDNNC B008Y7SMQU 4 1357776000 20 This plays great on my fire and is super  addicting. I find myself wasting lots of time on this game.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B00EJILIPA 3 1376697600 119 This is a teaser and not even a complete chapter.The premise seems to be an interesting one but can't really tell.From what I was able to play, the loading was slow and so was the story. There was a lot of going back and forth to the same HO scene though each time more objects were added. The story is pretty sparse but there are a lot of journal entries which need to be read to get a jest of the story. There is a 1hour time limit on this teaser which was interrupted many times by being asked if I would like to purchase the full game at $4.99.As you can guess I didn't buy.Played on a KF.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B0067Q4RCI 4 1344038400 74 Playing the game now and enjoying having a story to go along with the hidden objects that have to be found. It would be more so if I didn't have to tap everything before I find an object that clues me in to what I'm suppose to be looking for. G5 lives up to the standards that you expect from them. I'm playing on a Kindle Fire so the zoom feature comes in handy.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B008O661PK 4 1344816000 79 I had a problem downloading the free version of this app on my Kindle Fire but once I got it to download, I wasn't dissappointed. I enjoyed the story, searching for the hidden objects, and solving the puzzles.They weren't hard though some were repetitive. I liked the fact that there was a Hint option and that you weren't penalized if you used it. It's worth the cost and I'm sure that I'll get part III when it comes out.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B00BI3AFPI 5 1362787200 64 Just finished this game and I have to say that it created hours of entertainment for me. I played in casual mode on a Kindle Fire. The puzzles aren't hard, but challenging enough. The story was well thought out. There's a Hint button and a Strategy Guide if you need one. I've played most of this company's HO games and this is a winner.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B00DRHY8EW 4 1376524800 160 The graphics are very good and the story line is interesting and different. Even the music was nice to listen too.This is not just a regular HO game.You need to look for pieces that make up an object.They are not always easy to see so it usually takes a little more effort to find everything. You can zoom in which is helpful. There is a lot of licking to figure out what to do next so this is a more engaging game than most HO adventure games.My only issue was the Cursed Objects that feed the &quot;Hints&quot;button. I was never quite sure what I was looking for.There is a &quot;Strategy&quot; button if you're not sure what to do next which I found helpful a few times. I would recommend this game and I am looking toward to the next one.The full game is $2.99 and it was money well spent. I played this on my KF and had no issues.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B008FF8PT0 4 1341964800 44 Started with the free app then bought the game. Well worth the price.Graphics are very good and the hidden objects had just the right amount of challenge.The storyline kept my interest and the puzzles weren't too hard.All in all, Good game and Good company.
A149M9NFTTKV9G B00C71OUJC 2 1368144000 43 I gave this 2 stars only because I can't say that I hate it. I really wish that I could have given it 0 stars. Tried loading on my Kindle Fire but I couldn't do. it even after I took everything else off
A149MX68AYTYHE B009ZKSPDK 3 1383264000 41 I got on this app today and noticed all the cool new animals they added with this new update. I tried to spawn them but it kept saying there were to many creatures. Why add stuff that we can't even use???
A149MX68AYTYHE B00HF19RVK 2 1393804800 41 I loved the first chapter of this game. It was a lot of fun. Sadly, after I completed the chapter it asked for $4.99  for another chapter. That is WAY to expensive just for one chapter. Please lower the prices :(
A149NU70ZHCFAQ B007V5CF5K 5 1335398400 44 Quite pleased thus far (completed the first chapter).  Price seems a good value.  Lacks the ability to enlarge search area, but hasn't been an impediment to solving puzzles.  Isn't as graphically derpy as some hidden object games I've played - so that's a plus.
A149NU70ZHCFAQ B00EUCL6R0 5 1382227200 81 Wasn't sure I'd enjoy &quot;Book Of Heroes&quot;, its not my normal type of mobile game.  However,I find myself unable to atop playing! I'm usually VERY opposed to micro-transaction gaming. But this game seems nicely balanced-I have enough energy to complete several actions and if I find myself running low I just go start some chore around the house (ugh!) and by the time I get back I've recouped enough energy to soldier on.  Definitely worth a try. Now back to questing!
A149NU70ZHCFAQ B0067QCC70 4 1324684800 23 really enjoyable!AfterAfter a lengthy download, the game proved very enjoyable.  Graphically pleasing and relaxing (not timed) I was pleased with the gaming experience.
A149NU70ZHCFAQ B006QC53WG 3 1326672000 37 The game play is fine, visually cute, but it keeps freezing up.  It comes right back on but it is a minor annoyance.  However it is a free game, perhaps I'm just getting what I paid for?
A149NU70ZHCFAQ B007R41E8O 5 1335744000 28 Enjoyably macabre.  No time limit (love that)!!  Decent graphics, zoom capable, reasonable game length.  Definitely worth the price. A must buy it if you like this game genre.
A149OGRLLYBQ2W B00C2KWKIG 1 1376611200 106 This game is a scam.  You start out with a set amount of money, when you run out, you have to pay to get more so that the game will work.  Exactly how does that  qualify as a free game?  I fooled around with it for a few minutes, not being particularly careful, just to get the feel of the game.  Within 15 minutes I ended up with zero dollars, and a screen offering to let me pay for more use of the game.  The end result is a game that you don't make money on if you win, but lose money on if you lose.
A149OGRLLYBQ2W B00FAPF5U0 3 1398211200 260 I already knew enough about Candy Crush Saga to know what I was getting into going in, and it was free, so I haven't got too much to complain about.  The basic game is similar to a huge number of other games where you connect three, four or five in a row, and try to accomplish certain tasks.  The graphics are better than most, some of the levels are tricky but most aren't too bad, at least at the beginning. The catch is that you have five lives, once you use them, you either put the game aside for a while till you get more lives, or you buy lives.  At first you actually get lives as fast as you use them, but this doesn't last all that long.  Eventually you end up hitting levels where you have to buy boosters to be able to finish the level.  The free game ends up not being free.If you want to pester people on facebook to give you lives, or if you are willing to pay for lives and boosters, or if you're willing to quit playing when you get tired of playing for fifteen minutes and then waiting an hour to play again, the game is entertaining.  If you're going to get extremely annoyed when they ask you if you want to buy more lives for the fiftieth time, or ask you if you want to pay $0.99 to get extra moves to finish a level because you only have two tiles remaining, then this probably isn't the game for you.
A149OGRLLYBQ2W B005KC664W 4 1395360000 192 This sodoku game is the best I've seen in how the game is laid out.  Clean, clear and very simple to use.  It's only problem is that it has too few games per level.  250 games per level seems like a lot, but sodoku is addictive, and the simpler levels get emptied quite quickly.  I don't know if this applies to everyone who plays sodoku, but I like to play a variety of levels.  I'll do a simple level if I want to see if I can do it in two or three minutes, a moderately difficult level if I want something to puzzle over for the next ten or fifteen minutes, and a really difficult puzzle if I want something to work out over the next hour or so.  With Andoku the simpler levels are all completed relatively quickly, and the moderately difficult levels are completed not incredibly long after that.  All I've got left are the really hard levels.  They're fun, but the fun of the game decreases for me when I don't have the variety.  All in all, it's still a great game, and the ads aren't particularly obtrusive.

A149RP6X8TYGOG B00GXH3TGG 4 1398384000 58 I get pretty frustrated with games that you need to 'Buy' tokens, coins or whatever so I take advantage of the freebies when I can. I can't imagine someone dumping $99.99 on the best deal for this game.So I just play once in awhile when I've built up enough tokens.It is a pretty fun game when it's free.
A149RP6X8TYGOG B007HEQIMQ 5 1390176000 21 I have this app on my iPhone too,it's extremely useful if you have accounts at BofA. I've used this for years.
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B0061RRV62 5 1374364800 23 Love the game it a way to play a childhood and family time game on the go I have know problems with it
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B00AEJPK0C 5 1372291200 44 I was looking for games like bejewel. This one came close. I have enjoyed playing it. Need more jewel games. Create some with more adventures to them. That would be awesome to have. My oldest love playing all them. Hope to see more soon.
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B00BT21K98 5 1398729600 30 Never got bored. Just wish the could there were desktop version as well. And hope they don't make it a fb shared game.  It better one on one with yourself.
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B008LY1B32 5 1374364800 22 I love dominoes it a great game I love being able  to play dominoes on the go it is just so relaxing
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B00HHBXYGM 5 1395705600 21 Just don't want to play on fb with it. Should let you play it without needing to ask help from others.
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B008GU42KK 5 1403913600 21 Just wish you could play more stages without paying for it so soon. Otherwise it is great. Even for young kids.
A149SK0JMU3Q21 B00EDEMLTW 5 1379030400 20 Enjoying the challenges of the game. It real does test one's skills. It a very fun game for your mind.
A149TVEH0UUBVP B009UX2YAC 5 1365120000 26 This game sure does entertain me and lots more and its just really fun. Ill play this on the bus in the car at school everywhere.
A149TVEH0UUBVP B008PPGFZG 1 1369440000 23 I know it says u must have an Instagram but I don't so really what's the point if u don't have an Instagram
A149TVEH0UUBVP B0064DBE9I 5 1353024000 29 I always wanted to learn how to play piano and this app helped me accomplished that. this app only teaches you a few songs but it is very acurate
A149TVEH0UUBVP B008H4MVRG 3 1345248000 27 I love to play it but it wont let me update it.It says I need to but when I click okay it wont let me do it.
A149XOOBB17SL2 B009OA3TQ4 5 1400544000 20 Great game! Very challenging. My kind of game, I enjoy a good puzzle and point and click games! Good luck!
A149XOOBB17SL2 B00E5NH6YG 1 1400544000 51 Again another TV app you must already pay for cable to use. You must have a cable log in. Why Would I Want THE App If I Had cable. You're going to force people to watch ads anyway. The point of paying for cable is fast forwarding past all the commercials!
A149XOOBB17SL2 B00BI60DMU 1 1400544000 25 You have to have cable to watch these shows. It requires a login. I only use netflix. Very dissapointed in this app for my kindle.
A149XOOBB17SL2 B00A4KVFLY 4 1358035200 39 Wish I could get more coins per day without paying for them. Who were the people surveyed? Kind of old answers. Would like to be surveyed myself. If the actual players were surveyed, the answers might make more sense.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00BWBHIUG 2 1371686400 68 This game is ok but I do not like the quests that you have to do. It would be better to just build it the way you want not the way the programers want it built. The quests are kinda long, not very relaxing at all. The music is good and it is relaxing. I would rate a higher star if they would get rid of the quests.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B004ANMWPY 3 1391990400 44 This is not what I expected but i can at least tell what is on but the layout is not very good. I use it but the times do not seem accurate. Even when I change the time zone or zip code or carrier.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00BXPQN2K 3 1391990400 44 I like this game, but I downloaded on my galaxy 10 tablet and it will not connect to Facebook. I also down loaded on my mobile, Android, and it will only connect to Facebook with certain items and not everything. The game is challenging.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00CW6DAKC 4 1393200000 21 The game is good. but it does not show all my friends in face book. it plays like the original game
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00E5NH6YG 2 1394236800 44 Like many of the other TV apps, this one does not give you full episodes. I use Cox communications and they are not listed as one of the providers for watching the episodes. Seems to work fine with what I could do with it.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00FAPF5U0 5 1391990400 36 This game is addictive. I did not think i would play it but I can not put it down. Play it on Samsung Galaxy 10 tablet and android phone, Do not have any issues with either
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B005ZXWMUS 5 1391990400 25 This is wonderful for when you have little ones that need entertained while traveling or waiting on dinner when out. I use this program everyday.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B004SRNH10 4 1391990400 31 I like the adobe products, not really sure what this application does but my files said I needed it so i downloaded it and I have had no problems with it
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00A4KVFLY 3 1394236800 43 Like this game, but you need many many friends who can help you achieve higher levels. The answers are kinda dumb or don't even relate to the question. You write one answer they put a different answer sometimes it works in your favor.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B0064X7B4A 5 1361145600 31 Wish i had more buddies that would play. I am not that good a player but it keeps the mind thinking so i think this is good for learning new words.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B004FRX0MY 4 1397606400 44 Now I can have my music whereever I go without having to take along a separate mp player. my grandkids like it because it has their favorite music on there as well. You can play from the cloud or download to your mobile device.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B008QMMEOE 4 1394236800 28 My grandson is so into trains. The only issue is you get 3 free puzzles and have to purchase the others but it keep him busy for awhile
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B006RXD2I6 5 1394236800 24 I play this game all the time. While I am waiting in line at the bank or wherever. The list of games are great
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B0055S348W 4 1394236800 48 I really like this app. Was not able to print from my Samsung tablet until I installed this app. Now I can print what I want. But again only if I am at home with the wireless internet. I can also print from my Samsung Galaxy III phone.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B008N3TLNI 5 1361145600 28 this is a good game, just wish i had more buddies that would play, you can use your iphone, android or tablet. Soni can play on the go.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00808GTI6 4 1394236800 69 I really like this now I can keep up with out logging into my comp. The only down side is you have to be at your home to hook up with your wireless. But I can be doing dishes or sewing or what ever and still watch it. But you have to log in with your cable provider to watch full episodes and they only last a few days.
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B00DJFIMW6 5 1382486400 21 this game is addictive, i play for hours.good way to pass time whem riding in car on trips and waiting rooms
A149XUJ3L1Z22U B004SD5GZ4 5 1391990400 23 I like all adobe products. The flash player does not work very well on my laptop but it works great on my mobile
A149XXYGR6WKS9 B00820STKI 4 1379030400 34 I wish there was an ad free version because she keeps hitting the ads and knocking herself out of the app. I think this could keep her busy awhile if it didn't do that.
A149XXYGR6WKS9 B004VGWOO4 5 1327536000 73 With today's update it gets five stars from me. I play this every day cuz I can start and stop and it resumes where I left it. My only issue was the size of the cards. I got a stylet to play with so I wouldn't accidentally toss the wrong card. With the new update, I don't need the stylet, and probably don't need my glasses, either! Thc for a great free app!
A149XXYGR6WKS9 B006E4QCXU 5 1328140800 28 This is simple, but gorgeous to lose yourself in...like when you're contemplating the universe, or just trying to work something out in your head. Like doodling in space...
A14A09I70H73TR B0057J06HQ 5 1361232000 32 I love this app. I highly recommend this app and zombie office hint always throw far because if you hit something you get a achievement but hit the guy with pie lol
A14A09I70H73TR B0097M6WDG 5 1361318400 29 I love this I play all the time. I unlocked every thing and his nouge Is funny. Get this app and I'm sorry if your parents don't let you
A14A09I70H73TR B008JK6W5K 5 1360022400 20 I thing it is a cool game and who ever doesn't well you don't no the kinda games is in
A14A0E33D6O53K B006PH7WBM 5 1334275200 27 its a really good game especially since it is free but its a little difficult if you don't have neighbors so feelfree to add me :)  loveshelbylee
A14A0E33D6O53K B00A9NXGAO 5 1360454400 37 I play quite a few of these games and this one is by far the best. Tons of mini games, fashionable dress up, they only need to work on the adding friends program. Add Me! N26DN :)
A14A0E33D6O53K B006OCM13M 5 1334275200 25 so fun and its honestly really cute especially since its free its difficult with out neighbors though so feel free to add me :)  loveshelbylee
A14A0E33D6O53K B006OCM0G0 5 1334275200 44 its a really fun game and if you look on all the 'story' games you'll see me review it the same way because I do love all the games but it does get difficult without neighbors so feel free to add me :)  loveshelbylee
A14A0E33D6O53K B007VUA7VO 5 1359158400 39 This is definitely the best battery app I have ever used. It's always correct and it gives you accurate time left estimates for different kindle activities like apps and reading and watching movies as well as battery capacity charts.
A14A97GPKBI7ZI B00CKG0A0C 3 1385510400 50 Sometimes it keeps collecting gems and then you get so many & they disappear.  That valentine game had 100 roses then it went black and I lost them all.  That was not fun.  Why does the game wait so long before letting you spin the wheel.  That's a real downer.
A14A97GPKBI7ZI B0063GSL60 5 1355875200 20 Moves fast- lots of fun and it  sure takes your mind off everything else. I'm still exploring other options offered.
A14A97GPKBI7ZI B00F9ZO3Z4 4 1385510400 21 Fun game.  But I always run out of tokens and have to quit playing.  They should give you more free tokens.
A14A97N0I0LHOM B00A6D5GBE 5 1361664000 30 at first i thought it might be a childish game but as the levels go higher it does get harder its a really cute game im glad i got it
A14A97N0I0LHOM B0063IH60K 5 1326844800 21 I am glad I downloaded. this game it works great -no problems its so easy to play on my kindle fire
A14A97N0I0LHOM B004K4RY9M 3 1334016000 27 the word finds are a little on the easy side if you like a challange this is not for you something good to just pass the time
A14A9ZBVTL2BDV B00BZ17Q8M 2 1378425600 57 I played this for quite some time and was really diappointed at the lack of &#34;excitment&#34;  I tried all money values, didn't seem to make any difference.  I NEVER got one Bonuz !  And hardly anything else exciting..  The tornados came accross the screen often, but they hardly ever paid off either,  Maybe I'm just not lucky?
A14A9ZBVTL2BDV B00EBQRSTK 3 1378425600 44 Maybe I didn't play it long enough to get some hard ones..but most of these seemed like they were for the younger age group.  I didn't look around on it much though, so maybe there was a &#34;level &#34;choice that I didn't see ???
A14A9ZBVTL2BDV B00FX6ZBXC 5 1395532800 26 Love this game! You can play on and on or play for awhile then return to the same game ,it's on your own timeline . Fabulous!
A14A9ZBVTL2BDV B008R9OIUO 5 1388361600 37 Like everyone else I wish it had a zoom feature..but it is still pretty fun.  I like this type of searching keeps you on your toes as far as observation.  Good mental work out.  Try It !!
A14A9ZBVTL2BDV B00C7TAF3Y 5 1383609600 40 I LOVE it!  Graphics are the best! keeps your attention/mind sharp.  I'm stuck right now however and not sure what to do...humm..how to find the answer?, wish there was a way to get an answer when you're REALLY STUCK !
A14AAGFOON4C1A B004JJUY4K 4 1378598400 21 search for just  about every thing that I need to find for cost comparison in hotels and travel in the usa
A14AAGFOON4C1A B008A07U0U 1 1378598400 22 complicated to figure out, unable to figure out the objective of the game or what can be accomplished from playing this game
A14AB0FRPM0E1W B00A8ECU24 1 1384473600 207 The cute factor of this game is high, but after you've bought all of the ponies you can with the coins you earn in the game, there is nowhere to go. The game becomes pointless because there's nothing left to try to save for or do. You have to spend real money to progress further.As a child of parent who is unwilling to spend real money on fake video game "belongings," my kid has lost interest in and stopped playing this game because you can only get so far without using money.The makers of this game could easily remedy this problem by offering more ponies, buildings, and decorations buyable with the gold coins earned within the game, but they are quite obviously trying to get parents' cash by making it impossible to move forward without our money.If you decide to get this game for your Kindle Fire, be sure to set up parental controls to require a password for purchases so your kiddo can't spend your money. And know that unless you are willing to spend your money on animated videogame ponies, this game will eventually disappoint your child when they reach the point at which they can go no further without mom and dad's credit card.
A14AB0FRPM0E1W B00AKEMHCA 5 1371427200 163 I downloaded this game because my 7-year-old son used to play it online before the Ninja Kiwi website gave our desktop computer a virus that destroyed it. A computer technician was able to salvage my son's baby pictures off the hard drive, and then we had to throw the computer away. Mean virus. In short: Warning for parents: Don't let your kids play games on the Ninja Kiwi website! The website also led my young son to some YouTube videos of teenaged boys teaching kids how to play certain video games... while using a full range of curse words like mother-eff-blank, which I found disturbing.Because of my negative experiences with the Ninja Kiwi website (ad and virus-ridden, content safe for teens only), I was happy to find a safe version of this game my son loves to play. It's a cute game that involves popping balloons, and he often chooses it during the one hour of screen time per day we allow him.
A14AB0FRPM0E1W B009ZKSPDK 1 1396224000 563 This game allows kids to go into Minecraft-style worlds created by other people. Most of these worlds are cute, with Harry Potter themes, movie themes, animal themes, etc. But many are full of very graphic sexual descriptions and talk of drugs via signs on the walls, and are completely inappropriate for anyone under 18.This game is rated &#34;Guidance Suggested,&#34; but should be rated &#34;Adult&#34; based on the Amazon rating definitions (i.e. &#34;images of drugs, alcohol, tobacco, graphic violence, profanity, or crude humor, sexual and suggestive themes&#34;). I want my money back, Amazon, because of this completely deceptive and false rating.Parents who care about preserving some semblance of their children's innocence; don't waste your money on this game. It is obviously overrun with dumb tweens trying to shock people with &#34;Oh-so-naughty!&#34; sex and drug references *rolling my eyes*What sucks is that my son really loved this game, and now I'm taking it away because I can't control what he sees, so yet again, the idiots of the world ruin a good thing for the rest of us. :(Since my 8-year-old child has started playing this game, he has learned about cocaine, heroin, and other drugs in some stupid &#34;drug world&#34; an immature moron created. Today he showed me a &#34;fun love&#34; world where I found myself reading on the wall signs (people who create the Survivalcraft worlds are allowed to write anything they want on signs) about b-jobs, h-jobs, bondage, the f-word, and a lot of other entirely too mature and sexually explicit content for children.That was the last straw. I'm deleting this game from his Kindle Fire and the cloud, and I feel completely ripped off by both the game makers and Amazon for the deceptive rating. I'm not going to order another Kindle from Amazon for my son ever again, nor will we be adding anymore games. The parental controls don't work, and the game ratings obviously mean nothing to Amazon. It's a joke.(The game I ordered before this one was Pixel Gun 3D, which somehow allowed strangers to talk to my son through the game's chat function, even though I keep my Kindle Fire parental control settings on &#34;No Internet Access.&#34; I deleted the game after I caught my son giving out personal information to a stranger. Wow.)Seriously, game makers? Do you care about the safety or innocence of children at all, or just money? Don't any of you HAVE kids? This game should be rated &#34;Adult&#34; and you know it. Shame on you, Candy Rufus Games, and shame on you, too, Amazon, for facilitating this deceitful way to obtain parents' hard-earned money. Utterly pathetic.BTW: This review is coming from a woman who used to play guitar and sing in rock bands. I'm not some sort of ultra-prude, and believe that sexuality is healthy and natural. But I highly resent that I was forced to attempt to discuss b-jobs, h-jobs, rough sex, bondage, the multiple meanings of the f-word, and other such emotionally mature topics with my 8-year-old son this morning, thanks to the signs all over the walls in one of the worlds he went into that described such things.Had there been the &#34;Adult&#34; rating THIS GAME SHOULD HAVE, I would never have bought Survivalcraft for him. I'm now headed to every form of social networking on which I participate to let other parents know about this highly inappropriate game.
A14AB0FRPM0E1W B00AMR1HZ8 5 1371427200 113 I love the show and this game is no exception, with the added benefit of moving faster than the show and allowing you to compete, of course. As you move up in the ranks, new clothes and accessories become available for the avatar of yourself that you get to design, which is cute. I also don't like loud games, and you can turn the sound completely off and still understand what's going on because the game uses &#34;word bubbles&#34; to ask questions, which is a nice feature. If you're a word nerd like me who loves to read and write, you'll love playing Wheel of Fortune. Well done, Sony Pictures Television. Great game.
A14AB0FRPM0E1W B00I6IKSZ0 1 1395014400 250 Although my Kindle Fire's 'Parental Controls' are set to not allow any Internet access or online purchases, my 8-year-old son was somehow able to chat with other kids (strangers) while playing this game.I checked my settings and even changed my password, but my son was still allowed access to strangers through this game no matter what I did.Even though we've had the &#34;Internet Stranger Danger&#34; talk with our son and told him to never share personal info with anyone online, I caught him telling another kid (or potential online predator posing as a kid, depending on my current paranoia levels) his age and where he goes to school via the game's scrolling chat function.I am now deleting this game, because despite the fact that my son loves it, it won't allow me to control his online access to strangers, and this makes me uncomfortable.My son is admittedly a very immature and impulsive 8, so with that in mind, I would only recommend this game for parents who are certain their kids are mature enough to know what is acceptable and safe online behavior, because this game's chat function has the potential to create easy prey for pedophiles posing as kids, trying to get personal information.I may sound a bit overprotective, but I truly believe we parents have to be vigilant about this sort of thing. Our kids are growing up in a very different world than the one we did, which is great in many ways... and scary in others.
A14ABQGIX744GP B004JJUY4K 4 1361750400 45 I have been a loyal Kayak.com user for many, many years and downloaded this app to be able to compare the functionality and features I am used to on the computer accessed site. So far I am very pleased with getting the results I needed.
A14ABQGIX744GP B0057B1C90 4 1376870400 27 Has decent graphics, great sounds, is an enjoyable game for a waiting room time filler or for kids to finish practice.  Does get boring after 15-20 minutes.
A14ABQGIX744GP B0058VW36U 4 1361750400 25 This is cute, but for the younger ages.  I and my elementary kids get bored with it after only 10-15 minutes.  Good graphics, good interactivity.
A14ABQGIX744GP B008Y2FRFO 3 1369094400 21 I use the free coins quickly and often have to wait until more coins become available so it looses my interest.
A14ABQGIX744GP B00BHHIWQO 3 1369094400 24 this game is addictive, but i don't like the panda bear that only allows me to play 5 times until the hearts are replenished
A14ABQGIX744GP B00CO6TOBY 4 1377734400 37 I played Tetris a lot growing up and wondered if my maturity would get in the way with my enjoyment but I was wrong. This game is so addictive, still interesting and close enough to the original.
A14AC58FZSWJIU B00992CF6W 5 1386892800 25 Great game I got it and played all night I had a house made of gold.I suggest that u get it...get its worth the money
A14AC58FZSWJIU B00FS0VUWO 1 1386892800 26 SUCKS ALWAYS GLITCHES OUT ON ME...PLUS EVERY TIME I RANDOMLY BLOW UP.I ALWAYS look at the reviews and judge by that.the planes cost way to much
A14AC58FZSWJIU B00GSZEBE2 3 1386892800 30 The game graphics are stupider then stupid ok.and I've only played once and keep buying junk for the game like skin.PLUS the game is like Sims.dont wast your money.GOT IT
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B004QEC2EI 1 1328918400 25 who would ever mix the things that shouldn't b mixed, fashion and *ughh* math. lets c, U GUYS! THIS APP SUKS! BAD IDEA!. helloooo, duhh!
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B00529IOXO 4 1328918400 28 I love this app my only prob is u can only get pics from yr pic folder. (on kindle fire) they should have a folder just 4 this
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B006T01L30 3 1330041600 34 ok dude, here's the deal: u like the app: 5 stars. U hate the app:1 star. u gave 1 star and great review. plzzzz change that. ok, so, my review is its 2 challenging.
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B0060BE8I8 1 1328918400 33 talk about boring. the first time, it was ok. now it sucks. a little more adventure, plzzzz. thank u, 4 nothing! peace out, I'm gonna go play an app that's worth th $
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B007HBA70S 1 1338595200 28 j.b. stinks. silena deserves better.  Justin is getting arrested 4 beating someone up. plus he sounds like a Gurl. ... who's with me?  review yr thoughts about this
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B0074W01II 5 1338508800 28 it so cool. more addicting than rootbeer and Katy Perry.  if u agree review and ill look. Katy Perry is da bomb I love rootbeer and this app
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B00689PMD2 4 1328918400 21 all the thing says is update me!!!! ah, no way! trying.g 2 b careful. it really is a fun game, though.
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B004DPIEF6 5 1330300800 56 I was hanging with some friends in my little sisters room. shes seven, and not 2 annoying. so I was playing around with it. I pointed it at princess, Ally's toy horse, and it went mad! princess's eyes turned red and POOFWHAMBAM! I'm dead. so is the friends.:( when I say it I mean th app
A14ACH5GDZDY4L B004HM35RC 5 1328918400 27 I &lt;3 this app its AWESOME. so intertaining. ya gotta love it :) totally rocks u should play it if u hate it : WHATS YR PROB!!!!!
A14AD6QCO7VK9L B004X1TJQI 3 1314748800 29 This is a basic tower defense game with a redneck twist. Play is smooth, but it gets old quick. Probably worth the buck, but glad I got it free.
A14AD6QCO7VK9L B004YXE438 4 1322870400 33 My wife isn't much of a "gamer", but she loves puzzles. She loves this app, and so do I. Very challenging images, and varying difficulties make this playable on almost any screen size.
A14AD6QCO7VK9L B004MNO0BQ 4 1322870400 38 This app works ok on my phone, but was incredibly fun on my EeePad Transformer. Multi-touch displays allow for two player games. My wife really liked this too, possibly because she beat me 2 games out of 3.
A14AD6QCO7VK9L B004Q6Y2LM 4 1322265600 24 I really like this app. However, a recent update added additional permissions. They have since been removed, and I am back to collecting stars!
A14AD6QCO7VK9L B0052UZIFA 4 1322870400 85 I have played this game on multiple platforms. I am a little disappointed at the lack of additional features (like those present on the Nintendo DS cartridge version), but solid game play is still there. Two minor annoyances though. First, the first name, by alphabet, is the default that comes up... not the last user who played. Second, on my EeePad Transformer the level ending graphics where you collect your new seed packets is very sluggish. All-in-all though, a great game that I highly recommend.
A14AD6QCO7VK9L B004T5RDBG 4 1322870400 78 I am using this app on my Android 2.2 phone, and love what it offers. Keeps my phone running smooth and without a lot of background apps. However, I ran into a lot of problems with this app on my Honeycomb (3.2) tablet. It was likely my setup, because you can tell it what apps to kill and which to leave alone. Not necessarily for the casual user though, lots of options in setup that could cause problems.
A14AD8BFHXN1PB B008FF8PT0 4 1368662400 23 easy to see not too hard or easy has enlarge. good variety or games would but little more than I like to pay
A14AD8BFHXN1PB B007V5CF5K 1 1372809600 29 can not enlarge and cannot see images.  this would be a very nice game if you could see what is on the screen not for a kindle size screen
A14AD8BFHXN1PB B008X8QCTO 5 1372550400 21 great worked well and nice length.  has help button and clear images interesting story but store was similar to other games
A14AD8BFHXN1PB B00I5UHKPA 5 1393027200 50 love it great graphics _ easy to see - playing on kindle screen some games are hard to see - so far good story - l just started so can't say about entire story - I don't usually rate games but this one is one to get and good price
A14AE17NAQWV5U B005KCQZ2K 4 1363651200 59 This is a great app for the kindle fire. I and my family adore this app. The one thing I would change is that you can only get so many of the April coins it would totally rock if you got some of those coins when you passed a level. I still do ADORE this app. I recommend it.
A14AE17NAQWV5U B00CPOT3ZM 1 1370563200 38 I understand the  app was free and all but I wasted my money even though this app was free. U only get 2 people to play with and then you have to buy the rest with real money.
A14AE17NAQWV5U B0064DBE9I 3 1357084800 53 This app is ok but it does not have all the cords or the right sounds I play piano and it's nothing like the real thing but it's cute and easy to play but it's a little bit LAME. But no offence to the maker of the little piano. Thanks for reading this!
A14AE17NAQWV5U B00ANH526W 5 1361664000 36 I love this game. It's the best game I ever got, plus it's nothing like a cheat. I recommend getting the recruit Nicole she gives you a lot more of cash. It rocks. Get this app!!!!!!!
A14AEDP8E7BZV B004GVV4T0 3 1359676800 30 This is a real challenging (at least to me) game and I enjoy it most of the time.  Other times I just don't want to have to think that hard.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B005HK1JFS 3 1362355200 23 Great for kids, not so much for adults but I can see where someone with dexterity problems could really use this for therapy.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B009ZZGX98 4 1359676800 27 Just like the computer version this is really challenging - in fact I have yet to win a game.  I still like it and enjoy the challenge.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B004DM1ZQY 3 1358380800 31 Dice certainly seemed to be slanted toward the computer expecially with the doubles.  It becomes a real expected roll of doubles exactly when needed for the computer not for the player.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B004K4RY9M 2 1359676800 38 Some of the time the words that are found do not register as found no matter how often or how precise I am with my lines.  For this reason I really do not do this one very often.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B00AMR1HZ8 3 1359676800 44 I like the puzztes and enjoy trying to solve them but do not like not being able to control the speed of the spin on the wheel.  By the first spin I can pretty much tell how the whole game is going to go.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B00D4EBQ3E 1 1393459200 56 I have reached a point where I can not figure out what the word is the puzzle is looking for and found that there is no way to get out of that screen except to enter the correct word so I have put the whole thing away.  Up to that point it was fun and challenging.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B004XE06OY 5 1359676800 51 I love the challenge of this game and for the most part know that every time I open it I will be challenged and usally will be successful in meeting that challenge.  I hate for a computer to beat me so this one is great as I will only beat myself.
A14AEDP8E7BZV B007MTQ8C6 4 1359676800 20 Found this to be fun but getting just what you want to move to actually move can be a challenge.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B0063IH60K 4 1390089600 33 This version of solitare is classic Klondike. It would be a lot better with chat and no advertising nag screens. The nag screens ruin the fun at times, but the game is free.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B00A4KVFLY 4 1398124800 44 This is a decent app to find out if you have your finger on the pulse of pop culture. It does crash every now and then, and sometimes it changes your answer for no apparent reason. For the free price it is worth it.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B0085VR7WU 3 1370563200 25 This implementation of Farkleis a lot of fun, especially if you play on facebook. . I do wish it would have a chat box tho.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B00C5U3FS2 5 1382486400 51 You don't know Jack is a ton of fun. Not for the little kids, some of the jokes are a bit PG 13I love it. So download the game and have a good time. You can play it on many formats, ps3, Mac, fb kindle and many more.You must pay attention.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B0071PARPA 1 1400025600 35 This application might be great but they included an ad program that is classified as malware.Many people don't have anti-virus software on their Kindle, I believe that Kindle should ship with anti-virus software built in.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B00BJRH6HS 5 1380240000 25 It will kill a few hours I enjoy keeping my brain active.Having fun watching drunk people try itVery hard to do with alcohol in you.
A14AGJVZ7O1T7O B00FAPF5U0 4 1400198400 23 This is a fun application but I recommend you make sure parental controls are on because in application purchases could quickly add up.
A14AGS0MLYGX2 B007ZE34FM 4 1375488000 80 This app is great and you basically download music straight from Youtube. There is a lot more music on Youtube than you can buy on iTunes and stuff. The only reason I gave it Four Stars is because the app is almost Illegal in some ways. But the good thing is that it won't let you download a real famous Vevo song, because that's called Pirating and that is Illegal. But don't get me wrong, it's still a great app.
A14AGS0MLYGX2 B005ZXWMUS 5 1375488000 34 If you want to watch TV or Movies, get this app. It's just like normal Netflix. Five Stars, no questions asked. It's only a few bucks a Month, trust me people. It's worth it.
A14AGS0MLYGX2 B00B7Y0206 5 1375488000 31 The app is Youtube on the Kindle Fire. This app works so much better than just using the browser to watch Videos. Plus It's free. Five Stars, now get the app.
A14AGS0MLYGX2 B009GXHOW4 5 1375488000 56 The Description doesn't lie. Not this time at least! This app is great and lets you do things that Minecraft PE wouldn't let you do. Pro Version is better but free is just fine! Absolutely Five Stars! Sure, It's hacks but the hacks are fun and don't break the game at all. You go Zhuowei Zhang!
A14AHL7EE9R02 B004GYY714 4 1398816000 53 I gave it less than 5 stars because it has to re-buffer frequently when I tune in local AM radio stations. However that could be the local stations or my Wi-Fi. It has a great selection of music genres and it is easy to find what I want. I recommend it to anyone.
A14AHL7EE9R02 B00CKW6FVE 3 1370476800 25 I just thought I would try it out and found that I don't like the speed of the game. It shows Advertisements after each game.
A14AHL7EE9R02 B004SJ3BCI 5 1385424000 24 I am addicted to this game. I can't put it down. I have it installed on a Kindle Fire HD and it works perfectly,
A14AHL7EE9R02 B008D29K7G 5 1391731200 38 I use this app daily to catch all the important headlines in each of several categories. Very easy to use and very comprehensive reports. I recommend this app for anyone who needs to keep current with the news.
A14AHL7EE9R02 B00GT67UUM 5 1388966400 32 I like the graphics and the clever puzzles. There are many ways to solve each puzzle but each one is challenging. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys using your brain.
A14AHL7EE9R02 B00F8H0LM2 2 1389657600 50 The free version has a bunch of popups that can interfere with concentration. However, it is very challenging and I  would consider paying for it to be without the popups. I guess that's what they are counting on. I would recommend this game but be aware of the ads included.
A14AI9JN63TSCS B004GYY714 4 1331510400 25 Very nice app. Love the favorites list. You can select the type of radio or music you want to listen too. Works great and noproblems....
A14AI9JN63TSCS B009YOX9C4 3 1357257600 47 Its a nice app except for the most important thing. When reading the book you can not bookmark. So your last read page is lost unless you, go to edit book data and change the last page read. Its kinda a pain. All other features are great.
A14AKB8QB528OU B00HHBXYGM 3 1400112000 21 ITS A NICE GAME. I PLAY THIS GAME FOR PAST TIME. IT IS OK BUT NOT ONE OF MY BEST GAMES.
A14AKB8QB528OU B00D6SBOWG 4 1403654400 20 I love the game of Fairway Solitaire.  My granddaughter suggested the game to me and I really enjoy the game.
A14AKB8QB528OU B00HGJ18C2 4 1402617600 23 I LIKE THE GAME. IT IS ON MY TABLET WHICH IS CONVENIENT. I ALWAYS HAD IT ON MY PC. ITS A GOOD GAME.
A14AKB8QB528OU B00A4KVFLY 5 1395187200 20 I love family feud. I play it everyday. It is the best game on my tablet. Great game to play.I
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B009HHX414 5 1361145600 21 I do not text often, but sometimes need to.  This is much easier for me to use than my cell phone.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B00GY0HJ4K 3 1392681600 30 Down loaded it for a little girl who was visiting.  Not for me, so I deleted it after she left.  Great game for young children, but mine are all grown.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B00GH6HTEG 5 1392940800 85 I have trouble sleeping at night and the couple of times I have used it, so far have really helped.  I work odd hours, so regular hours are not possible.  I do not like sleeping pills.  I just got comfortable, attached headphones to my Kindle, adjusted the sound to my comfort level and was asleep in just a few minutes.  I awoke easily when my alarm went off.  No side effects and felt rested.  It may not work for everyone, but it does for me.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B00GINENG0 3 1392940800 25 My young visitor enjoyed it for a little while, but lost interest when she got to level 2 and really did not understand the game.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B0081JPTXK 2 1376697600 22 It just doesn't work well on the Kindle Fire.  The graphics are slow and require too many points for just a game.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B00AIUUXHC 1 1392940800 32 It was a little too gruesome for a preschool child.  As I understand the game, you make your baby shark grow by feeding it until it is big enough to eat people.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B00D4EBQ3E 5 1377907200 27 I love word games.  At my age it helps keep the old brain sharp and it is fun.  Good for any age because it makes you think.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B008AZGWYK 1 1389398400 66 I was hoping this app would help me learn more about a couple of medical conditions I have.  Instead, when I entered symptoms, it listed a lot of things that have nothing to do with my medical problems.  I tried to be clear and specific but ended up taking it off my Kindle.  It was no use to me at all - a very big disappointment.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B007SYXJXG 4 1361145600 67 I have had DirecTV for many years and have been very happy with it.  Recently, I got the app for my new Kindle Fire and my only disappointment has been that I can't get it at work.  That, however, is not the fault of DirecTV or Kindle Fire.  The place where I work allows TV and computers during times when we are slow, but blocks certain websites.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B007INJOFE 5 1370649600 48 This is subtitled &#34;Praying the Scripture Over My Loved Ones&#34;.  It is for anyone with family and friends they are praying for. There are prayers for different needs and a place to list individuals you are praying for and their needs.  Outstanding for groups that have prayer chains.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B006IXO1G2 5 1366848000 38 I have had Ancestry.com for several years and now that it is on my Kindle Fire HD, it will be easier to take with me and help with my research.  I need all the help I can get.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B00BJRH6HS 5 1379203200 22 I am 70 years old and I enjoy games that help to keep my mind sharp.  It is fun.This game is challenging.
A14AKI8Z6UGQ0S B004NE3T8Y 3 1388707200 36 A good idea and app that I need.  There are not enough clear instructions on setting it up properly.  I will probably like it better when I have time to sit down and figure it out.
A14AM8FH71JYP1 B004N2NWQ0 1 1322352000 29 as stated...doesn't support kindle fire. the arrow wont recognize when I flip my kindle. please fix!!!!!!!! I want to prove to my wife that I'm not a Morin. :D
A14AOLQQB58R1T B00AMR1HZ8 5 1375142400 38 I love this game and I purchased this game hoping it would be like the TV show.  I was not disappointed at all.  I have won almost all the rounds I have played but it is a challenge.
A14AOLQQB58R1T B00681Z1JA 5 1372636800 28 Solitaire has been around a long time.  It has beautiful music in the background to play while you play the game.  It has different games you can play.
A14AOLQQB58R1T B0093BM38O 5 1375142400 35 Set-up just like the real game.  It is a challenge just like the real game on the TV.  I like the challenge and enjoy playing it like I like playing it on TV.  Great game.
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B007ZGO7EM 5 1377907200 29 Large font, so it's easy to see. Really helpful , and just great over all. I reccomend this for anyone who isn't good at mental math (like me ;P)
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00B7Y0206 2 1375488000 104 First off, when you open the app up, it shows you a mini tutorial. Then once you're done reading it, it brings you to a new .. page thing ( Still in the app ) and you paste the YouTube link where it says &#34;Paste YouTube Link Here&#34;, and once you do, you press the button right below it where it says &#34;Go!&#34;. Then it brings up a &#34;General App tutorial&#34; That just sorta introduces you. It gives you many options on how you want to download it that I find very confusing and no  matter which one I chose it didn't work :/
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B009HKL4B8 2 1386460800 28 The app wasn't really fine in my opinion. couldn't even play-- couldn't even open the app without getting a message saying that it needed to close. lol failure
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B008JGSM6G 4 1386460800 22 Great app & game !! Many many levels to complete & the app doesn't need an internet connection which is great too
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B008Y7SMQU 5 1386460800 34 Amazing & awesome app! Soo many logo's & getting hints are totally free -- which is great because i struggled with alot of them. there are 23 stages total which i think is great
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DOIBYYG 2 1386979200 27 i made the mistake of buying the app before reading the reviews for it, so after i read the views i uninstalled it, very dissapointed & upset
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B005HSL626 5 1381622400 30 You don't need an internet connection to play, so that was great. It has multiple games so you can't get bored, you constantly unlock new features. I really like it
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DJYC55C 4 1385164800 22 i love that she quizes you with really cool questions, & you can interact with Angela . fun app for kids yupyup
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B005V1N71W 5 1381622400 21 The songs they provide are great, it's easy to find whatever you need, but you do need an internet connection ....
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B004LZIZHU 4 1385164800 24 Was a time consuming game most certainly. but was really entertaining & gave me something to do when i was bored so totally cool
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00FAPF5U0 5 1386460800 21 Really fun & time consuming game! Many many many challenges to complete which i think is great for a free app.
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B004SJ3BCI 4 1386460800 20 Froze everyone in a while for me, but other than that the app was great ! really fun & addicting
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B004DPCSKI 4 1377907200 25 Although the readings were things we didn't really understand, it was still an adventure. I reccomend this because it gives you something to do c:
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00BMR5HOO 5 1386460800 44 The app works great! let's me set multiple locations, & even if i'm not in the app, the temperature still shows in the drop-down menu which is awesome. gives you predicted weather for other times of the day which is cool. love tha app
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DJK2TO8 4 1386979200 34 Lot's of songs to guess, does get a bit harder with each new level of course. the songs are up to date, so you don't have to worry about not knowing most of them
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00A0XOT68 4 1386979200 23 really challenging & fun at the same time. a little addicting AHHAHAAHHA but it's a really cool game/app to play if you're bored
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B005ZFOOE8 2 1386979200 34 Didn't work well for me, it kept freezing & sometimes didn't even let me open the app; which was a shame becase i was really looking forward to using it to listen to music
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B0095FNJKO 3 1375488000 42 One good think I liked about it is that you don't need an internet connection to play it; you can play it while traveling. It had many more options on this app than on GirlsGoGames.com which is good in my opinion ^_^
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00AKOB7CG 4 1375488000 56 It provided these workouts:- Ab- Arm- Butt- Cardio- Leg- Full ( All of the ones listed above together )And once you selected a workout it gave you these choices:Select Workout Length | 10 min 20 min 30 minSelect Workout Routine | ( I'm guessing here)  Upper Body, Lower Body, Middle Part ( Belly? ) and Settings
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DS86XPM 5 1386460800 74 it's a great app, with many choices of singers. the free ones are:- Adele- Avril Lavigne- Adam Levine- Akon- Beyonce- Bob Marley- Bruno Mars- Carly Rae Jepsen- Demi Lovato *- Elvis Presley *- Eminem *- Gotye ** = you have to rate the app first to be able to unlock them& plus there are other people too, but you must buy them; not like, induvidually. but like you have to pay for the app
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00B2V66VS 4 1386460800 21 Really fun & great~! The game doesn't need WiFi which is great, & the game itself is fun ! really coool
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B004SCR8QU 4 1375488000 46 Right when I opened the app, it took me a while to find the menu ( Tap on the little gray circle to get the menu ) And once I got the menu opened it had a few choices. But in all, I really liked it
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00CZDSK7K 3 1386460800 32 App kept freezing or having to be closed; but when i was able to play, it did give me something to do. wasn't the funnest thing i'd reccomend, but i like it
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B009HHX414 4 1385164800 78 Great app! i use it for my Kindle Fire HD, & it works just fine. i can change my information when i like, which is great. it gave me my own number which was coooooool. The only things that weren't that great was that it didn't notify me right when i recieve the text, it froze every once in a while, & you most certainly can't call. but other than those minor things, the app is perfectly fine
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00ED4TX2A 4 1377907200 38 It works fine on Kindle Fire HD, but a problem that I've been having is that it takes me around 4 to 5 tries to open up the game.But other than that then the game is great! :D
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00B7ERH04 1 1386979200 32 didn't even open most of the time, but at the moments it did open it froze right away. really sad because it looked like a great app & the reviews seemed fine
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B007N5YIUS 4 1386979200 31 the only thing i didn't like were the constant ads that always popped up, but looking past that i really enjoyed it! really fun & having to plan stratigies were cool
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DCQXHGS 4 1386460800 105 The step-by-step walkthrough certainly is interesting i must say. along with showing you how to draw the celebrity, oyu get to interact with the picture, shich is really cool in my opinion. the free/unlocked celebs you can do are:- Angelina Jolie {face}- Adele- Akon- Al Pacino- Angelina Jolie {upper body}- Avril Lavigne *- Barack Obama- Beyonce *- Bob Marley *- Brad Pitt *- Cameron Diaz *- Channing Tatum ** = you can access those people after you rate the appThere are many many other choices of celebs. to get them you must pay for the app {but the app at first is free of course}
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DJFIMW6 5 1385164800 24 Totally awesome game! the minions were so cute, & it gave you multiple scenes that you could race through. Totally fun & worth it
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B0086700CM 5 1381622400 25 Its really fun to play, and it works anywhere; no internet connection needed, which i thought was great because i'm always bored during car rides.
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00A4KVFLY 4 1386460800 31 really cool app! the questions are random which is seriously cool. you need a WiFi connection i believe though, which sort of sucks but other than that i love the app!
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B007JPG04E 4 1385164800 24 This game is seriously cool, & i love how much you can actually interact with everything in the game. the challenges are really awesome
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00F7YHDWC 5 1381622400 32 Its really fun to play, although it is the same mini games over again. The only difference is that you have to complete them faster and faster, which makes it more fun
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00BGBOK9O 3 1385164800 41 It's fine; i think that the pictures don't match the word much. but it does give you something to do when you're bored. the hints are free, you just have to wait a few seconds before you can use the hints
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DQ8APIK 3 1386460800 31 it is something to help time pass if you're bored. the app doesn't freeze for me at all which is lovely. it doesn't need a WiFi connection either, which is great
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00APKDEH6 5 1377907200 33 Really easy to navigate things on my Kindle Fire, and the layout is great! I thought it would be something confusing, but once I got and opened up the app, it was great!
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B009UX2YAC 5 1385164800 22 It's really fun, & works just great on the Kindle! it wors smoothly, & constantly giving fun challenges. i really like it
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00BWA8BAS 3 1381622400 30 When i first started playing it, I was having alot of fun, But after a while it got less exciting, but I had the urge to finish it. Really addicting
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B0058UZSGS 4 1377907200 25 It helps me keep track of everything I need to do! Great for school and out of school things, and helps me stay on track
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B009ZZDNT6 4 1381622400 28 The alarm works just fine, it has many settings to personalize it. Multiple noises to use to wake you up, you can ajust the brightness and volume too
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00FJLK3WU 4 1385164800 45 Really cool! what i don't like is that you run out of energy really fast & easily because every single task you do takes a whole lot of energy, which is kinda sorta stupid but eh. But other than that, the app is totally awesome
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00BMNM4H6 5 1385164800 26 It's just as great as the desktop version! i found no problems in it. the game ran smoothly, & the levels did get harder & harder
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00BFWY2KG 2 1374969600 20 Very little choice in episodes which was pretty upsetting. Always froze, or didn't let me watch at all.. .. ..
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00DY76ZC8 4 1385164800 31 This app is totally cool, & has some relly funny pictures ^_^ it does crash once once it a while, but i'm totally fine with it because it works right away
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00CEKIGGO 4 1386979200 36 Fun to play, addicting, & just over all really cool. You get to customize your own little village, & there are lost of things you have to accomplish so you don't get bored with it. coool
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B0069G5Z9K 5 1386979200 20 Extremely fun & really entertaining! Really fun to gain goals & to accomplish things! a very addicting game to play
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B006S3HN6C 3 1375488000 27 The song choices they give you for free are:- Boom Boom Dollar- Cotton Eye Joe- Oops I Did It Again- Video Killed The Radio Star- Witch Doctor
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B005X9498M 3 1386979200 24 Of course it isn't an actual iOS setting, but i thought it was really cool. some of the apps actually work which was cool
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B00594XOZU 3 1377907200 54 It doesn't notify me right when I get a message, wether my Kindle Fire is on or not (...I got this app for my Kindle Fire ....) I can't seem to find a menu for it though; for like, if you want to block users or something. But other than that then it's fine!
A14AXB2EY4MK4X B006SMEV9K 4 1374969600 33 It was very helpful, you can change the color of the 'paper' that you're typing on which I found pretty cool. You can label the note's priority as &#34;Normal&#34;, &#34;Important&#34;, &#34;High&#34; or &#34;Hot&#34;.
A14B217UYGZDW B00BW08XRO 5 1396742400 20 This is an awesome game.I don't have much to say because to be honest I'm only doing this for 500coins.
A14B217UYGZDW B00DS86XPM 5 1376870400 20 This app teaches precise steps on how to draw famous singers.I loveit there is no flaw at all.get this app.
A14B217UYGZDW B00CWKYUSE 5 1382227200 33 This game is awesome.it might take up a lot of space and a while  to download but it's worth it.the best part is that's it's free.it's just like it is on the ps3.--
A14B217UYGZDW B00I8Q77Y0 5 1394150400 20 This game be popping tho better than the original version like the bootlegged version all day boiiiiii it be littttt
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B00CD3L8JY 5 1386547200 29 2 1/2 year grandson LOVES puzzles and he very much enjoys playing this app.  I like to purchase so we don't have to worry about ads interrupting the fun.
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B00EEDJHXA 5 1391817600 78 I got this as a free app of the day. Its a good time spender. Has never crashed and as far as I can tell no malware. It did annoy me by the rating pop up between games so hopefully this will solve that. I play it and so does my 3 year grandson. He likes to cut the buttons and then &amp;#34;back up&amp;#34; to start over. Its great free but I probably would have considered buying it.
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B0060I3IJG 5 1323388800 34 just TRY to stop once u start! Using on my kindle fire. Only disappointment is getting the &quot;network connection error&quot; too often. love love love this app. it is my #1 fav. no joke!
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B0052OSTOS 4 1394928000 38 I got this app to help me relax and practice meditation.  It is a personal choice, but I found this app helpful.  I also believe that this type of relaxation and meditation is good for mind and body.
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B006CTJCWK 3 1396915200 34 I thought this would be a little more full anatomy... it's mostly muscular.  Which is great if that is your study.  It is a personal choice and this app is just not for me.
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B007SN9TKE 4 1394323200 54 I have used this app for quite some time and jumped the chance for the Pro version via the FAOTD. It's easy to use and I have found several &#34;go to&#34; recipes in it.  I don't know if I would pay for it, but I would definitely recommend the free version.  Hope that helps!
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B006P4FBUE 5 1400371200 33 3 year old grandson LOVES loves loves this app.  It's fun and on my kindle fire, it's actually big enough to educational. Even I find it amusing to do for a few minutes.
A14B4MJ7KZE63B B00IKZX1ZI 1 1400284800 44 It may be free to download and play for a few rounds... but then the &#34;opportunity&#34; to pay to advance is presented.  I just HATE that.  And thus, I quickly uninstalled.  Before discovering the paid &#34;opportunites&#34; I found it just &#34;ok&#34; and quickly boring.
A14B5OB0NNTLBW B0086700CM 3 1339632000 27 I absolutely love temple run but this app was starting to make me mad, the more you play the more it will freeze up and you lose.
A14B5OB0NNTLBW B0054JZC6E 4 1327536000 24 this is a fun game. I love playing it in my free time and my daughter enjoys it too I would highly recommend it
A14B5OB0NNTLBW B007HH3K5G 5 1331510400 27 I really like this game :) it is very fun. I recommend. it to people. and I like to poop my pants and eat it...it smells bad
A14B98SYJKRYX7 B0087FMUCQ 4 1389052800 27 This is a lot of fun to start, but as the game advances, the imprecision of thecontrol of the ball works against the enjoyment of this game.
A14B98SYJKRYX7 B006P1UR60 4 1391385600 67 It's great to have such an app. rather than have to search for an outletor office to purchase the maps. The advantage with a paper map is thatyou can spread it out and study the detail. With this, you can see details onlyon a small portion of the screen.Overall, it's portability and features make it nice to refer to when out hiking,or planning an outdoor construction project.
A14B98SYJKRYX7 B00H1MDH3W 3 1389052800 29 This app is ok. Not a lot of explanation for the various tools, so it's kind of hit and miss.I would shop for something a bit more user friendly.
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B009KS4XRO 4 1365811200 39 A realistic bingo game that goes fast and isn't boring like some of the other bingo game. The only thing is the callers accent sometimes a little difficult to understand but do have a display as numbers are pulled.
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B00FAPF5U0 4 1382400000 31 Enjoy the game and very addictive. Like the different challenges it give you but don't always like the extreme difficulty on some of the levels but then it is a game.
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B008A07U0U 2 1364515200 24 very boring, just wasn't my type of game. Children would be more apt to enjoy and that might be who it was intended for.
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B00AVGGYNA 4 1364515200 23 I like most bingo games nothing to surprising about this one, just a way of passing the time when nothing else to do.
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B009G41CG2 5 1387152000 21 I could play this game all day lovng, is addictive and very challengine, makes the mind work and very quick play
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B0098LBZPG 3 1360627200 21 Thought that there was more to it and just didn't care for it. That is why I took off my Kindle
A14BDOM3T9CC6X B00DJ075FQ 3 1387152000 20 I like the game, keeps the mind working and challenging. It just needs better access doesn't always open for me.
A14BFXBM8N27KH B00BGC5UAG 1 1368230400 22 someone else might think this is fun and challenging - but for me just seemed to be more boring than anything else.
A14BFXBM8N27KH B00BGAZYLI 1 1368230400 23 I think there are other options that are more fun as well as a challenge for the average person who likes word games
A14BIAVRW8SOQB B00DREKMPO 3 1390521600 31 I like the app, but the free version is pretty much useless.  The premium version has all of the bells and whistles, and they're good ones, but I can't afford it.
A14BIAVRW8SOQB B00AQ398AY 4 1390521600 24 The free version has all of the basic features I was looking for, and everything works as advertised.  The premium version even looks attractive.
A14BIAVRW8SOQB B008DYK0I2 4 1390521600 32 I passed on downloading this a while ago, but I needed it to watch a specific event.  And after I used it, I was glad I had gotten it.  Easy to use.
A14BIC3WHDKNZB B00933JL0A 3 1349568000 22 I really was enjoying playing this game, but it froze up on me and won't let me play it anymore. Any suggestions?
A14BMEFB3KRJGR B0054JZC6E 3 1337904000 25 soles of. the games. are dfrrussstgating... othessz are biff. oft. s a ok. ga.e.  sorry I cant sxpell good tomddsy. I. hopiit is aalrogh........ ick...
A14BMEFB3KRJGR B004MC8CA2 1 1332460800 26 it would be better if it was king James version. I was very dissappointed when I noticed that I didnt get the right version for me.
A14BNSV5ATC0OU B00A1SL8SE 5 1358553600 34 fun little game where your gole is to navigate an eye out of his holding cell. the graphics are fluid and rather creepy and the music fits perfectly. definitely worth the free download today.
A14BNSV5ATC0OU B004WPKENW 2 1316217600 77 the game installed and runs fine and the controls are as responsive as one would expect however this is one of the most frustrating games I've seen for a faotd. the only way to get any decent score is to land at the vary edge of a platform and as the jumps are hard to judge in the first place this gets annoying vary quickly. if you don't care about score this game may be for you.
A14BNSV5ATC0OU B005DTZAZS 2 1341878400 38 game starts fine, plays the story and the opening cut scean of the Dino flying through the vortex then crashes before I take control and can do anything. really disappointing as it looks like a well made game.
A14BNSV5ATC0OU B006M5A75K 3 1324512000 37 I knew this wasn't going to be my cup of tea as I don't like word games but was trying it out for other tablet owners. game runs fine on Acer Iconia tab A500 running stock 3.2.1.
A14BRBM01VQTP B00702PZME 4 1329782400 20 great addicting game! works well on the kindle fire and some can definately be brain storming which I love! haha
A14BTVCEMPEP9 B005DSLRDS 4 1364601600 49 I downloaded it for my Kindle, and it is ok; good for updates and stuff. I really suggest getting it on your phone though. Once I do that, I'll be incredibly satisfied! There are so many sounds and references; I can't wait to make the TARDIS my new ringtone!!!
A14BTVCEMPEP9 B004H6G0TI 5 1364601600 25 This game is awesome!I'm addicted to it. This is the next Jetpack Joyride. There are so many new planes to unlock, and they're all different!
A14BTVCEMPEP9 B00DDN6PB4 2 1384732800 20 Yeah, not worth it. It's just really slow Battleship. Really slow. I do not suggest it, it really isn't fun.
A14BTVCEMPEP9 B00FATEJYE 2 1386460800 22 An ok game, but it isn't anything like the original version. An alright game for free, but I wouldn't go for it.
A14BVMPHTWFZZF B00G6CFW9K 5 1405728000 23 Super fun and super addictive. I cannot stop loving it, one of the best mmorpg games I've gotten. Can't wait to play more.
A14BVMPHTWFZZF B006OBWGHO 5 1357948800 46 I THINK THIS GAME IS REALLY FUN AND EASY.WHEN YOU'RE BOARD OR WAITING YOU CAN ALWAYS PLAY THIS GAME TO PLAY TO GET TO THE NEXT LEVEL,OR COLLECT COLLECT ALL THE DUCKIES,OR DO THE COLLECTIONS,OR EVEN PLAY THE BONUS LEVEL.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE
A14BVMPHTWFZZF B00DUGCLY4 5 1405468800 20 Very fun, I like playing this to blow off time. Half the time I get stuck but still very interesting.
A14BX1V3VMYSQY B00CKW6FVE 5 1388016000 32 This is a fast paced game and very addictive. A must have if you are a Tetris lover. I have played most of the Tetris games and this is absolutely a favorite.
A14BX1V3VMYSQY B00BGC5UAG 3 1362787200 23 is ok but hopefully gets more difficult soon. hoping for something a bit more challenging but good for a broad range of ages.
A14BX1V3VMYSQY B00FAPF5U0 3 1383436800 59 This game would be outstanding but not all of us are facebookers. It would be much better if there were special features you could earn use of, not just unlock . I know this is a social media game but I'm not a social media girl. maybe adding special items for always use after a certain level of achievement.
A14BX1V3VMYSQY B00BHHIWQO 5 1378944000 27 This game is fun and challenging. I just wish the lives and gold bars  accumulated faster. I recommend this to anyone who likes fast moving puzzle games.
A14BX1V3VMYSQY B00CWY76CC 4 1390521600 73 I played this game when my brain was a bit numb so took a minute to catch on. It was challenging, but for those who like problem solving it is very fun. Once you figure out the pattern of how it works it is easy to figure out but you still have to search and some of the clues can be a bit elusive. Will play more when there is more to play.
A14BYIL9LJNCYW B004UCO0FA 5 1363478400 20 Very easy to navigate! Love it! I would highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to read the Bible.
A14BZCN6PXC22D B007CK1MEY 2 1353369600 36 for a little while then it gets boring. I love bowling in person and on the Wii but this game was very lame. I will probably delete it soon. No issues with it working correctly though.
A14BZCN6PXC22D B009LFGG76 5 1382659200 20 Excellent game. Love the words, the colored lines and the ease of playing.  Timer keeps me trying to beat myself.
A14C0AKJH9P5K3 B008N8IV2U 3 1344643200 53 I love the game but the fun and games only last till level 40 just to stop to a probally failed function in the game. You are supposed to turn the volume down to open the door bit the door wont open. I would rate 5 stars if it wernt for this problem.
A14C0AKJH9P5K3 B006VLNIFQ 1 1335571200 44 This is the game dumbasses chose when they rather play with a cardboard box over a laptop. The game is just reflexive tapping. I sure as hell wont pay for this. I only got it cause it was the free app of the day.
A14C0AKJH9P5K3 B00846GMHW 5 1341014400 41 Many people keep saying that there are only knives and no guns . . . The game never did promise guns or anything other than knives hence the name &quot; Throw the Knife&quot; over all i enjoy the game very much.
A14C0AKJH9P5K3 B0086700CM 5 1338076800 36 getting on the kindle and updating was so hard but now i just click and update. thank you amazon. this is one of ny favorit mobile device games and now i have it on my kindle.
A14C0AKJH9P5K3 B006MK63XK 5 1335312000 46 Love the game but honestly. . . y would a gir that hot go around saving the world one headshot at a time. . . im not sexist but thats kinda never going to happen. not the zombies part but a hot chick that shoots rifles.
A14C0AKJH9P5K3 B007LCZJPQ 5 1334707200 21 This is amazing. The Kindle Fire runs the app perfectly. The game is addicting and exciting. Download if you like fun.
A14C4I90E4YYK B0091REZMW 3 1352851200 40 Received several prompts to download more of the game. Did a couple of times not realizing how much memory it would consume. Some of my other apps started having noticeable degradation and others would not even open. Had to uninstall
A14C4I90E4YYK B007SYWFRM 4 1340841600 25 Not a social gamer so those quests go u fulfilled.  Similar and simpler than Oregon Trail but without the bugs.  Good value to price ratio.
A14C4I90E4YYK B00E8KLWB4 4 1396310400 21 I would rather not have energy restoration limit play, but decent game so far.  Have not had to use crystals yet.
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B00E1LILWI 5 1385769600 25 Very informative the kids love this app, from the 15 year old to the 2 year old, easy to use. will suggest to my friends
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B00GNIJAEA 5 1385769600 28 Love this app, can interact with my Facebook friends was pleased to find on my kindle works just as great as my phone cant wait to tell everyone
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B00CD3L8JY 5 1385769600 27 my 2 year old nice loves this app it is easy to use the 2 year old can work this app all by her self love it
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B00B7Y0206 5 1385769600 21 I am so impressed with this kindle app can watch cartoons and vides no delay with main streaming love this kindle
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B00E3WJRIM 4 1385856000 22 Very entertaining game keeps me thinking I can play on this game for hours this is a very fun game for me
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B00BHHIWQO 3 1386374400 20 This game was ok kept my attention played for hours fun to play nice colors I really enyoted this game
A14C5PBSWNKZ8P B007JYI4SU 2 1385942400 20 It's cute to play with but lose interest wouldn't really recommend it to  anyone kind of boring not that fun
A14C7F2928KU9A B004TTMYQG 5 1304640000 31 As many have said, its a great app, better than the stock app. Great display of appointment times. The widgets it allows are also very useful. Worth buying,  in. my opinion.
A14C8NLKQ6X1G1 B00A6F6DIW 5 1397692800 20 Awesome fun without paying against anyone but yourself!!  I enjoy this very much especially as the degree of challenge increases!!
A14C8NLKQ6X1G1 B008JJS6D2 4 1362787200 37 I would like to see the whole number blocked out when you use that space. It's much easier for people to see their winning row (if they have one) when they like me, have vision problems. TY
A14C8NLKQ6X1G1 B00CB8JY9M 5 1380844800 27 Love the ability to play against a bot or a live person on one device!!  I wish Farkle Live was designed as well as this program is!!
A14C8NLKQ6X1G1 B00FAPF5U0 5 1382227200 35 Almost as much fun as Bejeweled Blitz, but not quite.  Actually kind of a rip off of the main idea of Bejeweled Blitz with some variations.  Not as addicting either, it's just because it's newer.
A14C8NLKQ6X1G1 B004TBM4VY 5 1394323200 25 An excellent way to exercise your mind!!  Crossword puzzles CAN help to ward off Alzheimer's early onset or just help people who already have it.
A14C99POEUML4N B007EC27QM 3 1386720000 36 It works like those basic handheld calculators I used in grade school. It calculates one operation at a time. It's severely limited for an app on a tablet computer. If only RealCalc were available on kindle...
A14C99POEUML4N B00H1MDH3W 2 1386633600 82 When i first open the app then &amp;#34;back out&amp;#34; of it, the app closes returning me to home. However, when I attempt to re open the app, I find that the app did not close in the first place. Instead I get a blank app screen with the title, and I am NOT able to exit without hitting the home button. I then have to force close the app.Also, the time is about 1 minute 5 seconds faster than the device time.
A14C99POEUML4N B004DLPXAO 1 1352592000 64 The older kindle app worked perfectly on my LG optimus, but the up-to-date version is such a memory hog that it freezes my Samsung. Totally disappointing! An e-book reading app should not do that. I can use Aldiko and Google Play Books with no problem, but I have a kindle e-reader and want my books in sync on my phone. Please fix it Amazon!
A14CAX8UOLRZRX B00HDPT2RM 2 1391299200 79 ya i know this developers games are more expensive (little too so) but they usually have decent stories and play well. this one however is plagued by warped sound; freezes; instances of totally kcking you out of the game,  and finally as if i were not frustrated enough it just totally stopped. amazingly thrre are no problems at all until you buy it. so play enjoy and stop as soon as it asks you to purchase. kindle fire owner.
A14CAX8UOLRZRX B00CWG9EUM 5 1381363200 22 loved it. good mini games nice graphics interesting story line. another home run for big fish. i look forward to the sequel.
A14CM9WRQVJ87I B00CJ95O2E 4 1377993600 25 I think it's a good product but you really need to put the power percentage on the notifications without  us  having to open the app
A14CM9WRQVJ87I B00FCYEZOQ 5 1388707200 27 I love this app so far i only had to cheat 1nce thats good for a person like me !! Thats why i rated it 5 strs
A14CM9WRQVJ87I B00I8Q77Y0 5 1393718400 23 This is an awesomely addictive game that you take a bird and you tap it so it flies its harder than it looks!!!
A14CM9WRQVJ87I B005ZFOOE8 5 1394841600 22 This is a great app because I can listen to tons of my Britt Nicole Tunes! Overall this is a great app!
A14CS57WZG6FZM B004LZFWJO 1 1319846400 20 This game was fun... for about 60 seconds. Then you realize what you see is what you get... Let down.
A14CS57WZG6FZM B0058VW36U 5 1318118400 52 I absolutely love this game. Its always different and keeps me actively thinking. Even if this wasnt the FAOTD last a couple weeks ago I would still pay $1 for it in a heartbeat! Runs smooth, fantastic gfx, and their social system is sooo much better and simpler than Feint! -Evo 3D
A14CS57WZG6FZM B006D1ONE4 4 1323820800 54 Ive had my eye on this popular game for a while, but I very rarely pay for apps. Thanks to Amazon sale I nabbed it for only 10 cents! Beautiful graphics and catchy music. My 2nd fav game next to Cut the Rope! 28mb no SD so not friendly for all devices... -Evo 3D
A14CS57WZG6FZM B004Z9ZNTK 4 1319932800 46 On the first level, things started off smooth but then they start rushing and overlapping one another. So its almost impossible to grab the right one, or even one at all!  Liked the concept and the graphics but its just too hard to control.  Evo 3D
A14CS57WZG6FZM B005EI48SI 3 1319760000 103 The aspect ratio looks a little off on some of the menu screens and i notice the same issues with calibration. You cant hold the device upright, like normal. It has to be flat facing up which is uncomfortable... Also the japanese text is annoying, but cmon did somone really just give a 1 star because they &quot;couldnt follow the story&quot;? LMAO Its a ball rolling around an obstacle course! What kind of Inception-style immersive story are you expecting from this?...overall2/5 control3/5 gfx4/5 gameplayI say worth checking out while its free but I dont think Ill keep it on my phone long.Evo 3D
A14CS57WZG6FZM B004GBARY8 4 1319414400 47 works well on Evo 3D but its very repetitive which makes it kind of annoying to have to look at an endless loop throughout the day. If the bats flew in different paths and there was more variety in the jack o lanterns then id go 5.
A14CTX7M7AIAWC B0063IH60K 5 1390348800 22 Great game to play. Easy to play. Like the way you can change the layout. Bright colors and love the hint button!
A14CTX7M7AIAWC B008JGSM6G 5 1386547200 21 Having a blast playing! Love the colors and the ease of play. Would recommend it to all:) Got to get it.
A14CZ57O0J0JI1 B004GMT14Y 5 1389830400 69 I Love this app. It is a wonderful resource for writing and quick check word meanings and usage. Another great use is if you cannot think of the word you want to use, you can put in a word with the same meaning, hit the italicized t and it will give you synonymous.  The &#34;Word of the Day &#34; feature is fun too.. I would higher recommend this app
A14CZ57O0J0JI1 B005FQO096 4 1397001600 130 As with most trivia games, this one starts.off very simple.  If you don't go five for five you more than likely have heard about the bible more than read it. But as you go through the questions they become very detail.My son and I have read the Bible through for the past two years and are doing it again this year, and of course the Bible study and sermons we have heard through church attendance, and the questions still stump us ( me more so than him). But that isn't to say we don't love this app. The text is right there to give the answer and this enables you to see.it, and read it in context. I could see this being fun in small groups.  I would.recommend this app.
A14D1UVJ7DSXWI B006QMNQ6Q 5 1347494400 30 very challenging but a lot of fun. extremely addictive. will keep you up way past bed time. been looking for this game for awhile. glad that I finally found it.
A14D1UVJ7DSXWI B00BG3ID0Y 5 1369958400 65 A very unique game. Most of the puzzles are pretty easy and then they sneak a difficult one in and you really have to thinkabout it. So far I have been able to solve all the puzzles with one hint or less. Pretty addictive. Next thing you know an hour or two is gone. Glad someone finally came up with a different kind of game.
A14D1UVJ7DSXWI B008IXP8IU 5 1377907200 25 This game works all my brain cells. If you like word games you will love this game. Ranks top 5 of my favorite word games.
A14D40VDXO54CZ B00AEC8UVU 5 1394409600 22 I downloaded this for free and it was a fun game. Try it you'll like it. Did not take long to finish.
A14D40VDXO54CZ B0073LHCCS 5 1378425600 35 I have had this game for at least 6 months. I just started playing it and now I'm addicted! Not too difficult, but keeps me thinking. Works great on my Kindle Fire. I recommend this.
A14D40VDXO54CZ B00IKZX1ZI 5 1395964800 20 Get this! My 3 year old granddaughter loves the graphics, but GRANDMA likes to play. Very similar to Candy Crush.
A14D4XQXOBBZ8A B00BJCLUXO 5 1379203200 34 I love this and so does a little friend who stays with me when Mom and Dad go out for the evening..  I collect Kaleido scopes so I really enjoy playing with this too.
A14D4XQXOBBZ8A B00CELIPL4 1 1381017600 21 Sadly this did not install was hoping to have this to keep a little girl busy when I babysit her tomorrow.
A14D4XQXOBBZ8A B007ZGO7EM 5 1387843200 40 I really like this app easy to see Don't need any light to have it work.  It does percentages well . A very cool calculator who all the features I need &amp; then some. This is one must have also
A14D4XQXOBBZ8A B00CX5IXFY 5 1377043200 55 I really love solitair an this works just as it should I did beat it the first time and several times since but then I play solitar on my computer and my DS often so this is nice as I only have to take my Kindle with me and have games to play very happy
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B006H7TC3Q 3 1337817600 333 This is a fun app for people who love to mess with their photos. If you're expecting something like those novelty sketching photo booths you see in arcades (like I was) you may be a bit disappointed. It doesn't actually do any &quot;sketching&quot;, but rather applies pre-made sketch &quot;frames&quot; to your photos and modifies the colors based on a number of predefined themes. What you end up with is an image that is quite clearly a photo but with a decent sketch look. You could think of it like taking a color-corrected photo and putting it into a frame that has a sketched border. The look is decent, but if you use the same sketch theme a lot you may notice the same sketch pattern on all your photos.The app itself is easy enough to use, though I found the crop session to be a little overly complicated. It took me a few moments to figure out where I was supposed to go to finish cropping the image since the crop buttons hid themselves after I started adjusting. It isn't a big deal, but a small set of constantly on-screen buttons may have worked better. The rest of the app is laid-out fairly well, though it feels like it could use a bit of polish here and there, such as with the look adjustment sliders you get after choosing a preset. They just look very out-of-place. The ability to use any crop size instead of being limited to approximately 4:3 or 3:4 ratios would be nice, too.While I got this as a FAOTD, the $0.99 price point seems ok for what you get, though some may argue that even that is asking a bit much for what is essentially a set of Photoshop filters. I would give this app another star if it improved on the small usability issues, and another if it could add the ability to crop arbitrary ratios instead of fixed portrait and landscape ratios. Overall, a decent, fun app.
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B004X1TJQI 2 1314748800 102 I would love to say this is a fun game, but I wouldn't know--the game crashes so much that I can never get into it enough to enjoy the game. 8 out of 10 times it will slow down and eventually make my SGS2 unresponsive for a while, or force quit by itself. the graphics are ok, and those complaining about the woman in the screenshots probably haven't seen the great family portraits. It's a redneck family, and I find it very humorous. The game is simplistic, but decent fun... when it works. If fixed, I could give this maybe 4 stars.
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B004IAE62Q 3 1310774400 121 If the other reviewers hadn't already made it clear, the controls suck on this otherwise decent game. While I'm cool with the rather old school &quot;shoot where you're facing&quot; setup, it took me a few tries to realize the automatic fire wasn't always working properly. At first it felt as hough my fingers were slipping off the fire button area, but even with fingers firmly-planted my ship ceased firing. Worse, this seems to happen primarily when there are many enemies on the screen. Lots of enemies + ship not firing = death + loss of fun. Had this been a non-issue, this would have gotten at least an extra star from me. It received 3 stars because it's decent fun otherwise.
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B006ON41FC 1 1329436800 495 I really enjoy this game. This is a distance game where you must fly as far as you can while collecting nuts and achieving goals along the way. The music goes quite well with the speed of the game, being of the country/rock variety, and the sounds are adequate. The graphics are really nicely done, with bright colors all around and good color choices on different objects and obstacles. The game never gets frustratingly difficult, and I played for hours before my phone needed a recharge.The game does have some flaws that impact my score for it, and they're mostly due to the interface. For starters, there are no tilt controls. In this type of game, tilt controls would benefit steering the squirrel greatly. Instead, you're stuck using the left and right sides of the screen for input. Since you can select power ups while flying, tilt control would freed up your fingers to use them instead of having to choose between flying left or using a crash helmet. You can't set anything up from a main options screen; everything is scattered. For example, you can't turn off the sounds or music from anywhere but in the flying part of the game, and you can't opt out of Open Feint till after it logs you in and starts collecting data. I really don't like OF, but at least other games ask if you want to use it instead of just using it without asking. Even checking achievements loads OF. Why couldn't this just be done in-game? Lastly, the power ups seem sparse. The squirrel has a very bad turn speed, so I was hoping there would at least be an outfit or gear that increased agility or speed, but all the outfits appear to be only cosmetic, and the gear focuses on nut collection, distance boosting, and collision with obstacles.Again, I really enjoy this game. I haven't had any freeze-ups or crashes in it like many other games do, and the game is really fun to play. The stars off from 5 are -1 for poorly-designed interface, and -1 for no up-front opt out of Open Feint. It's really a shame there are so many simple-to-fix problems with the interface that could have made this a 5-star game in my book.UPDATE: On my third time playing the game I was once again logged into Open Feint involuntarily. This was the third time I've had to delete the OF account because the game started it without my input other than launching the game. The game also asked me to rate it twice in one game. Because of the Open Feint problem and the constant rating nag screens I've deemed this game unfit to remain on my phone. Unless the developers start hearing the cries of their customers and remove the nag screens and Open Feint problem this game will not get anything past 1 star from me (down from 3 before the update to this review).
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B004S2FUH4 5 1334188800 243 I found this calculator to be very quick and easy for the calculations included, even so far as to do some reverse calculations. While super handy for what it does, the one thing I wish it had since it's a paid app is a built-in actual calculator that has basic math functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide). I say this because while trying out the tip function my first thought was, "so how much would a couple have to owe if the two wanted to pay their share together?" Then I wondered about other things, like what if I needed a total of several items before I calculated a discount percentage. It's not a deal breaker, but it'd be nice to have instead of having to switch between this and another calculator app. A great app overall.EDIT: I take back what I said about the app needing a calculator. What you can actually do is type out the calculations in the entry fields and the app will do the math for you. For example, if I needed to get the amount of a 5% discount from 3 different-priced items, I could type "79.99+39.99+29.49" into the Amount field and it will add the three together, then process the 5% discount. Great feature! A built-in calculator would still be handy, but I don't mind minimal switching to a regular calculator for the times I'd need to. (giving 5 stars instead of 4 because of this find)
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B005BFMQJC 2 1310256000 145 If you liked games like Kitten Cannon or Toss the Turtle, this game may appeal to you for about 5 minutes. While the graphics are clean and colorful, and the control is ok, the interface is so bad it left me scratching my head. Ok, I can make the glider float up and down by tapping on the screen, but why does the game end when the plane hits the top of the screen? How do I activate the boost items I just purchased? Why does the back button throw me out of the game instead of take me back to the previous screen or main menu? Why do I have to cycle through the entire alphabet just to enter my initials? These faults are game-destroying in my book, and this app has no place on my phone. I'd expect better from a paid app.
A14D5RI9Z4T9LC B005NJ2K6U 3 1319500800 263 I really like this game, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really care for match 3 games. I dislike Bejeweled with a passion, so I found it interesting that I found this game so addicting. The combination of gameplay elements, graphics, and sounds are really pleasing, and I found myself wanting to play more and more throughout the day. However...I'm not sure what it is with the match 3 games I've downloaded lately. This is the 2nd one I've played on my SGS2 that eats the battery like crazy, the first being Tropical Fish Shop. I've played other games that are much more graphically-intensive, yet they only use a fraction of the power. In fact, my phone gets very abnormally hot to the touch, and the game becomes the top power consumer in just a few rounds. Because of this, it's very likely I wont be playing this unless I'm near an outlet, to which case what's the point of even having this game on my phone? I get games for my phone to let me pass the time in idle situations, but if I can't do that it really reduces my interest in playing the game. Using a high end phone, I would expect this game to run more smoothly than your typical budget phone, which is why the power usage surprises me.Great game, but as of this review I can't give it more than 3 stars because of the power problem; I can't play it on-the-go for fear the game will reduce my phone's capability to be a phone.
A14D6XXT750463 B008G0HTUU 5 1350259200 22 this game is very fun,  I been waiting for gamevil to come out with this game. be sure to get this game!
A14D6XXT750463 B007V2UGPE 5 1337299200 31 This is amazing Game so much fun sometimes challenge don't have to spend money just be patient very fun and recommend this to anyone who wants a free fun defense game.
A14D6XXT750463 B006D1ONE4 5 1331337600 28 This is a must have game, and is so much fun, Both cranky levels, (bought both cause this so amazing) and other story like I said, must get!
A14D6XXT750463 B004ALVL6W 3 1331424000 43 It has it purpose I say it not worth its price but good enough it took me two games to figure out what the heck to do but once you learn, it a fine time killer if you don't have plants vs zombies
A14DB91BTEQQU0 B00ATSAVQG 5 1369958400 32 This game is addictive  and crazy great. Sensational graphics and beautifully designed puzzles to keep me wanting more. Hope there is more to come. I loved playing it over and over again.
A14DB91BTEQQU0 B0073LWEXK 5 1345248000 56 The graphics were great and the puzzles were challenging. My 8 yr. old grandson helped me solve many puzzles and navigate the many different places to go. We both loved it. I haven't found another comparable. All I find are ones with find the objects and they are boring I want the different puzzles. to solve.
A14DB91BTEQQU0 B00C71OUJC 3 1369180800 44 Good graphics. Good story line though it was incomplete. The ending wasn't an ending it left you hanging. I hate object find but this one wasn't to bad. The puzzles were challenging and fun. 3 stars because of the ending. Hopefully there's a sequel.
A14DB91BTEQQU0 B00EL71DR2 5 1377216000 206 I've tried loading this three times now. I've unloaded and reloaded. It keeps hanging up at about 64'5 MB out of 600' + $2.99 down the drain. I love games like these and loved the first two. I have a Kindle HD with 32 GB there should be enough room. What NOW???I emailed Alawar and they responded very quickly. They gave me options to try to resolve the problem and have since downloaded my game and am happily playing!!! The game moves nicely the graphics are great. I love games like this and wish there were more quality ones. Love Lost City, Abyss, Azada, Mystery of Lost Town... I like being able to control where I go in the game and some games like Nick Chase, Sprit of Wandering...  and other games that have stick people are too juvenile and lame. Anyway, thanks for their quick tech support. I have contacted one other game vender about a game I purchased and have not gotten a response back, so great job to Alawar! I am now changing my rating from the one star I left earlier out of frustration to five stars for a great game and teck support. Thanks again and make more games like these!!!
A14DB91BTEQQU0 B00C7TAF3Y 5 1397088000 50 I got hooked right away and couldn't put it down. Down loading Room 2.  This has great graphics in 3D to manoeuvre around to solve intriguing puzzles. It's a must have for any puzzle enthusiast. Well worth the 99&cent;. I'll be up late again tonight. Keep these quality games coming.
A14DB91BTEQQU0 B00ATPVA78 3 1372377600 77 Game is a nice story, graphics are great. $4.99 is too much!. They suck you in with the FREE app only to nail you with that BIG price to be able finish. $2. maybe $3 max for this. None of the puzzles had any instructions. You had to guess your way through to maybe hit on the formula to solve it. This is very frustrating for someone who loves the puzzles. Could have given a 5 star.
A14DE32GRVW6QV B00846GMHW 4 1340409600 25 this app is relatively easy yet its really fun and entertaining. you can earn awards for accomplishments you complete and get different weapons, clothes, etc.
A14DE32GRVW6QV B004H6G0TI 5 1364515200 23 Challenging and fun game. Many different planes to unlock and use with unique weapons. I wish people would play me on multiplayer though.
A14DE32GRVW6QV B008J8OH5O 5 1364515200 38 I love regular yahtzee. With 6 dice, there is a couple new combinations of dice that get you points. I thought that getting 6 dice all the same was going to be hard but i regularly get them.
A14DGXYHYVUXBI B004N2NWT2 5 1328486400 39 I honestly luv this game but everyone keeps on saying there's a rotation problem well their kindel fire must be messed up becuz well there is no rotation problem so in other reveiws when they say that there LIARS
A14DGXYHYVUXBI B0087HEQ6M 5 1338768000 38 this game may seem weird if you look at the photos but its a fun cute game that keeps my sister entertained and I tried the game its actually really fun and cute so posse get this game
A14DGXYHYVUXBI B006OCM13M 1 1343088000 27 ok it was working just fine then it switched me everything I went to level twenty to level nine I do not recommend this game to anyone
A14DGXYHYVUXBI B009OYOASG 5 1351468800 39 its a fun game that I had on my ipod until it broke (my ipod)  and I couldn't play but its on the kindle now!! its a fun game that is very addicting I recomend this game to everyone!!!
A14DHRVUQ8G9HH B004SJ3BCI 4 1378425600 38 Pretty cool. Different objective as you are trying to stop the pigs from stealing your egg. You still launch birds at them although the pigs are moving towards you instead of stationary inside of a building. Overall B+
A14DQVZM2SCWZN B0080HQXTM 3 1395705600 46 I don't like giving 1Weather a mediocre rating here, because it is absolutely my favorite weather app on an Android device.  However, the version Amazon serves up to my Kindle Fire has been stripped of functions that make it so great on Android.  Try something else.
A14DQVZM2SCWZN B004GYY714 3 1356912000 23 Tried it as an Amazon daily freebie.  It works.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, but I just didn't like it.  Uninstalled within minutes.
A14DR2RP5PAKNS B00933JL0A 3 1368489600 57 Decent graphics. Simple game play easy to learn. Really slow though with nothing special going on. Same old build woodcutter's hut, cut wood, build house, get more workers, build fish hut, get fish. Didn't take forever to load on my Fire. Hadn't frozen or crashed yet, so its ok. Won't be paying for the full version though.
A14DR2RP5PAKNS B007VUCAVO 5 1368316800 52 This is my go to app on battery life for everything. The only annoyance I have is with the Kindle Fire itself. With the wireless on, the batter drains super fast. Within hours. The battery life app isn't accurate in that case. I leave the wireless off and then it is perfect.
A14DR2RP5PAKNS B00AESN8XY 5 1368489600 66 I really like this game. Graphics are awesome, colorful, crisp and clear. I especially like the contours on the world map, mountains on land and in the ocean and shading for vegitation. The mechanics of the different infections and thier evolution is both facinating and scary. Feels close to reality, though I don't know if it really is. Plays and looks great on my Kindle Fire.
A14DTSUDO6GJJK B0067VKQLE 5 1378944000 24 I played this on my computer but wont work on my kindled! its so upsetting! but I love it! it does save time thogh
A14DTSUDO6GJJK B0096YJDNQ 4 1388620800 20 its really awesome this might be the best app ever out of the rest. hhhhhhhhyyyy hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh gghjj hju Hui hju
A14DZXR97HV22X B005AJ6ISO 5 1337472000 30 This is a great app!  I love getting Bible verses daily to encourage me and give me hope. I highly recommend this!  It's a wonderful way to study God's Word!
A14DZXR97HV22X B0063IH60K 5 1325376000 24 Fun and easy! And adicting! I purchased this for our Kindle Fire and it installed quickly and effortlessly.  And I recommend Spider Solitaire,  too.
A14DZXR97HV22X B00FAPF5U0 4 1404259200 21 Fun and challenging. Some levels take just one attempt and others take days.  Good time killer if you're waiting on someone.
A14E3BUD5J7EK0 B0066T8OH0 5 1361318400 24 I really like this game.  I hope this is not a temporary application because I use it to take my mind off any worries.
A14E3BUD5J7EK0 B00881VLCE 4 1361318400 23 I just wish I could use it without internet connection. Great app. We just need more subjects for puzzles. Loved the baby pictures.
A14E45PQUCD3MH B00ELMHHAE 5 1389398400 21 THIS IS SUCH A FUN GAME AND ITS EASY TO WIN. AND IT WILL KEEP YOU PLAYING FOR HOURS OF FUN
A14E45PQUCD3MH B00HCMG6LG 5 1390867200 24 I really enjoyed this game but there was not enough floors to continue playing. It really made you work for getting the doors op-ed.
A14E45PQUCD3MH B00CZCX2S8 5 1389139200 25 I love monopoly,so this game is just like playing it just with bingo cards instead of dice and everyone has an equal shot at winning
A14E45PQUCD3MH B00CWY76CC 5 1390867200 20 This is the first installment of  a really good game, but it's the same as part 2 not enough rooms.
A14E45PQUCD3MH B009L9Z6G4 5 1397001600 59 I was happy to be able to download the WWE App because I was able to purchase the WWE Network and watch WrestleMania with 3 of my boys and my husband. and was able to see all the action from the comfort of my own home. It was really AWESOME. and being able to spend family time is priceless.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00DCQXHGS 2 1377129600 110 I originally bought this product because it was free. Also I get to draw how fun is that.Upon later inspection I happened to notice the influx of advertisement ;inadvertently slowing down the app along with testing my patience.Of course,you can buy the real version of this app with no headaches but I was expecting something different.I assumed that with this app you could have side by side instruction on your device without having to get pen/pencil and paper.I also presumed that the technique would've been more thorough and not so...'here's the line...tap...here's the other line....tap....more lines ....tap ...done'Boring. Plus I believe art isn't supposed to be that blas&eacute; either. Disappointed.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00DQ8APIK 3 1376006400 28 it's what to be expected. not difficult not convoluted. straight forward and cute. I like it so far ...going to go back and see how far I get...
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00CKW6FVE 4 1376784000 30 AWESOME. two thumbs up. would play this all day...if possible. Good work EA. GOOD JOB. The pay to play option is optional which isn't detrimental to a gamer like myself.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00EH78DFQ 2 1376697600 47 only certain features are free. majority of gameplay is only purchase savvy. limited options due to purchasing costs. basically if you have monies to burn willy nilly ...perfect app. uninstalling due to lack of financial participation.  Love mermaids... I just wish this game had more free versatility?!
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B009C7ZQM4 3 1397260800 20 Its alright.  Sometimes it is slightly interruptive . Anyway works well. Clears unwanted caches and relative trash. Just ok. Thanks.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00CO6TOBY 5 1376611200 24 I have always loved Tetris... its a game to save time or even pass it. having it evolve as this...is preettiiee sweet.two thumbs up.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00632HWOG 4 1389052800 25 so far. no issues besides the spam situation.  but readily updated ....so pretty pleased.i do wish that the sync was more concise but its fine.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00529IOXO 5 1377388800 25 Absolutely a must have if you are an avid texter like myself. Plus this lightens my cell phone bill tremendously.  Whoop whoop. Does funky jig.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B004UBH4S6 5 1377820800 51 I like this app a lot. Firstly I would like to mention I am giving a 5star for adequate app updates and free access abilities as for mentioned in the prompter when I opened thee app today.  Keep up the good work, ID Mobile SA. I expect consistency as per usual.
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00ED4TX2A 4 1376611200 88 I just started playing and I was ready to level up ...when Zoink! I am back at the app store.  Why? Is this upgrade time or is the game seriously glitched? Note : I do possess the first gen of the kindle fire if that helps. Just thought I'd mention that. Sidenote: Device is slightly overheated as well after gameplay. Just thought I would mention that as well. Regardless of all the faults I think I would enjoy playing this app for days on end...just fix your bugs!!!!
A14E80ILYZEBQ1 B00CRLSN4U 4 1376006400 41 I like the app...but some movie frames do not match up to the guess.some frames were of all the same actor in 4 different movies. others had 3 depressed actors and one frame pertaining to the movie. its good but demi-glitchy.
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B0097GVJWQ 5 1354406400 32 Enjoyed this game. Looking forward to part 2. Liked the fact that you could choose difficulty level. I would recommend this game to those that enjoy solving puzzles and hidden objects games.
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B00DR91028 5 1391126400 29 The graphics are great. The ability to choose your level of expertise was one reason I tried this game.  Took the easy route.  Will try the difficult level next.
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B00HJ4G1MQ 5 1392940800 35 Can't decide whether I like the first one the most.  Like both of them.  The story  line seams t pick up where the first one ended. The graphics are fantastic. Will there be another ?
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B00B4VI8MQ 4 1379548800 24 I am enjoying this game. Most of the objects are fairly easy to find, others? well it takes time or use the hint button.
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B0091REZMW 4 1372032000 43 Like it a lot. Would give five stars if energy level didn't drop so quickly. My granddaughter likes trying to figure out what to look for when the words are scrambled. Not fond of the constant request to connect to Facebook and Twitter.
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B00CT9ZVGI 5 1382400000 30 The graphics are great. The story line is good. Just unlocking the full game. Have not finished the game yet but the parts I have finished were not too difficult.
A14E8VEOV2F8Q0 B0092S4WLY 5 1375747200 21 Loads of fun.  Keeps grandkids busy.  They love it. Wish there were more levels.  Hope any future levels are more challenging.
A14E9OQEC858DT B0064X7B4A 5 1362960000 36 Love this game. Play several games at once. Win some, lose some. While I don't care for the ads I still enjoy the game and it only takes a second or two to pass over them.
A14E9OQEC858DT B0097HTPE4 5 1367712000 51 Word Link is a game that challenges you to think,while some word associations aren't clear at first glance ,to me, I seem to pull them out. I enjoy the challenge! All in all, Word Link is a fun and challenging game. I recommend it to every one.This was a free app.
A14E9OQEC858DT B008IJTFYW 5 1367712000 73 As the name implies it is a relaxing app. I often can't sleep, and will use this app. You can pick and choose the sounds you wish to hear, and can even set the volume of each item separately, therefore making it your own. I set the timer for 30 minutes and rarely hear it end. Recommend this app to anyone who has a hard time getting to sleep.This was a free app.
A14E9OQEC858DT B008245WE0 5 1347494400 24 I have always liked the sound of rain to fall asleep to, and this app delivers. I like that you can adjust the speed.
A14E9OQEC858DT B006MLHVLM 5 1387584000 62 This is a fun app which I down loaded for free. The 2 yr old in the house loves it and is learning how to use the touch screen to move things, which help her with pre-school games. I like it too. Who can afford to buy new decorations each year? I can do it this way and have fun with it.
A14E9OQEC858DT B00CKW6FVE 5 1371772800 38 I have liked playing Tetris since I played the original and this one is just as much fun. :) I like the colors and music as well. I recommend you try it. I think you will love too.
A14EA7QO2JAWJ1 B008PPGFZG 4 1371686400 28 I love how it works and how it looks on my kindle. i think the money i spent on this app was sort of worth it i guess.
A14EA7QO2JAWJ1 B0085YOD1A 1 1371686400 21 This app basically tells you what you already know. Like the battery percentage and temperature. This app is basically is thermometer.
A14EA7QO2JAWJ1 B00CWY76CC 5 1372982400 51 I love that it challenges me and forces me to think. It's hard but yet not impossible to solve these levels, it makes you feel stupid once you figure them out but at the same time you feel like a genius because you passed them! Can't wait for the new levels...
A14EA7QO2JAWJ1 B00F8L2VO4 5 1393632000 63 I'm not going to lie to you when I say that I learned more french from this app than I did from taking french for four years when I was in high school. I mean this app is just great. Not only does it actually teach you french while playing little games but it's also FREE. Best app on my phone by far.
A14ED59CSH2Y9S B00B2V66VS 1 1360022400 44 the first day i had it it worked fine now it wont even open so i uninstalled it thinking it would work better if i reinstalled it but i was wrong it wont let me when i tap install it does not a thing
A14ED59CSH2Y9S B00992CF6W 5 1373760000 25 this app it the best app eva i love it its so much fun really u hav to get it iys the best app evar
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00ELV0WF2 3 1384128000 21 I usually like solitaire but this version is too small, it doesn't fill the screen and it is a little boring.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00GY0HJ4K 4 1389744000 39 This game is colorful and can be fun...it takes awhile for me to figure out how to pass the stages and is a lot like candycrush saga in that it only gives you five chances to get it right.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B004HGK6FW 5 1390435200 57 I love to do Sudoku and this is nicely designed with lots of options and levels to chose from and I can pause  and come back and finish the puzzle I was working on or start a new one...it is very easy to put the numbers in the squares...I really like the new updated designs and options.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00GCI69D6 3 1399075200 29 The pictures of each city are very colorful, I just did not see any directions to change the settings...the temperatures don't seem to be accurate on not in degrees.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00H83GGVO 1 1393977600 39 the directions were not clear and required too much reading, hard to see the items...I don't think I like this game since I play on the kindle and this is not a good game for me on the kindle.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00FAPF5U0 4 1384128000 50 It is addictive and can be fun, I get to playing this game and hate to  stop and that is the downside, when the &#34;lives&#34; run out and have to wait a period of time to play or buy more time...maybe they should sell a version that allows continuous play.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00D2XD5JU 2 1399161600 23 I could not get this to work on my kindle so I was disappointed in ;this one...did not get to experience the game.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00E8KLWB4 1 1390435200 22 this was to hard for me...I could not find most of the objects that were hidden and it was a little boring.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00IF2JW8G 5 1399161600 25 This was a colorful and fun game and I like it also because it can be played with or without skill and still be fun.
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B009WJNXAE 3 1393977600 53 When I first  tried the Bingo Bash, it was kind of hard for me to find much fun in it since it did not call for any skills,  I prefer games with more challenge, this is great for those who just like to keep on trying to when and not have to strategize,
A14EI4LTAKUP28 B00HGJ18C2 3 1402099200 30 This game was not very exciting, I was expecting something different...I played two games and may try again later, but it was not very fun...I had more fun using cards.
A14ELN5JUVTUZN B0088QDDDY 4 1381017600 26 It's really good, but I think it could be better. It was really fun, but they should add levels to it. Otherwise, it's five star worthy.
A14ELN5JUVTUZN B00G118LYY 4 1387670400 88 It's really good, but they could make it a little bit better. it's really fun,you get to drive through ice cream and water, and you get chased by a little dog. but thats only in the already made town. you get to make your own too. you can put in whatever you want, even a dog, a robot and a bird. unfortunately, in the make your own slot, you can only put a limited amount of an item, but that's the only reason I gave It 4 stars.
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B0077QL3OC 5 1370476800 22 people they fixed the game then multiplayer is great its great gameplay and I think u people with bad reviews should shutup
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B008S4YZCO 5 1344297600 22 I think it looks cool and fun great job gameloft you guys are awesome I hopeing you will make more awesome games!!!!!!
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B00CKJ2KK2 5 1370304000 37 I love this game. a guy told me to get it and I was like ok... and I got it and now its all I can talk about!! love it get if u don't ur missing out!
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B00AO2P3GA 1 1380844800 80 I bought for 7 dollars and then i tried to download it worked then the second download that the game requires it said i don't have enough space and i barely have anything so please fix this or give me my money back it did the same for modern combat 3 and it got fixed but im just reminding u guys to please fix it (P.S i have a kindle fire so can u fix it for that ;) )
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B00FATEJYE 5 1387670400 23 Very fun even though it took a long time to download it was very fun to play and i still am playing it!
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B005ZUR724 3 1345248000 23 its good but you have to pay after a while so you should get it but it'll have some problems along the way.
A14ELYG6S0AWBK B00I8Q77Y0 5 1391990400 26 Its so frustrating but so addictive. I am on a roll then BOOM! I die! Im like i just want to throw it out a window!
A14ENKX4YX03Z4 B0087TUZII 5 1343779200 33 This is a great game. People who like games like this. Will love this game. If I did not have this game I would get it. It has castles, knights,  kingdoms, sword fighting.

A14ENKX4YX03Z4 B007PTJOV0 5 1344384000 23 I really like this game. this is great . if you like Mario. you will like this game. you should get this game.
A14ENKX4YX03Z4 B00881VLCE 4 1389744000 88 this is a great puzzle game to play. the only thing bad about this app is that you only get certain puzzles that are free. do not get me wrong the free puzzles are great but I would like certain one like Christmas and Halloween puzzles and other ones like that but different. like cats and dogs. and others I would like to have without paying. any way this puzzle games has a lot puzzle you can get for free. some are plain but still great to play.
A14EO5N05BTEA3 B008N8IV2U 4 1355875200 60 LIKE THAT IT IS FAST (IF YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT) AND SIMPLE. LIKE THAT YOU HAVE A GUIDE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE CHALLENGED AND FIGURING THINGS OUT WITH NO CLUES AT ALL.WOULD HAVE APPRECIATED AN INTO EXPLAINING WHAT I WAS SUPPOSE TO BE DOING, EXAMPLES OF POSSIBILITIES AND INFO ON HOW TO GET THE GUIDE IF NEEDED.
A14EO5N05BTEA3 B0067Q4RCI 4 1342742400 31 This is my first hidden object game on my kindle and I'm pleased at how well it work in this format. Keeps me entertained and the zoom feature helps a lot.
A14EO5N05BTEA3 B00FIW5BZE 1 1393632000 25 WHEN IT OPENS ITS REALLY FUN TO PLAY. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE TIME IT WON'T OPEN OR IT FREEZES MID GAME.I WILL PROBABLY UNINSTALL IT.
A14EOZETIEB6RF B00JQNG6FA 4 1400803200 54 Well once u complete the 1st episode u have to pay the next episode 4 $4.99 kinda 5 bucks or 499 Amazon coins and it is a really fun game but once u get 2 where Pete and Nick r and u save 1 of em then that is the end of the episode.
A14EOZETIEB6RF B00AQ5A88S 5 1403136000 53 I love this app!It is just like coin dozer but this 1has seasons so that's pretty good but also ( this is a note for people who player regular coin dozer ) this app doesn't have the shake thing but it still has the prizes cool theme and stuff so yeah....GET THIS APP!!!!

A14EPLQ556ORW0 B00C0RE13I 3 1380499200 23 good idea, but the fact that you need to put up ACTUAL money in order to get anywhere, makes the game less fun
A14EPLQ556ORW0 B00DYY92MG 5 1380499200 18 some are easy or obviousand some are tough or obscureit's a great social game to play with people
A14ETFFELWXF9L B00CJ77HU8 3 1373673600 29 Dragon Gem is a good game that reminds me of many other like it with a twist.  It is entertaining and would be good for almost any age group.
A14ETFFELWXF9L B009KS4XRO 4 1373673600 40 Anyone that plays Bingo and other places will enjoy this game with interesting sounds and speed.  I think this is one that can tech all age groups the fun of Bingo and maybe even speed up a few brain cells.
A14ETFFELWXF9L B0080H2TFE 4 1373673600 35 I enjoy this number game and it's changeing styles.  I learn something new about it almost every time I play it.  You have to be careful though it can be addictive and time slips away.
A14ETFFELWXF9L B00EDEMLTW 4 1386028800 37 fast challenging and fun! I enjoy the color changes and that so far no two boards are alike. this game is good for young and old and gives one lessons that can be used in other games.
A14ETFFELWXF9L B00BJ9VBLI 5 1388361600 60 I enjoyed the changes in colors and the characters as well as building in the tree village.  It is fun to see how much the buildings are going to grow each time you finish a level and nice to be able to decide to build or wait t I 'll next time.  All together a fun game for any age.
A14ETFFELWXF9L B0064X7B4A 4 1362096000 42 I truely enjoy playing Words With Friends. I feel that I am learning new words and correct spelling at the same time I am enjoying time with friends.  I also have fun using the message board to share comments and news. -

A14EVM49LCGZPI B00683JNUQ 5 1323907200 28 I never saw the original, but this version has easy controls, smooth gameplay, and cute graphics.  Very enjoyable queuing game, and very engaging.  I highly recommend this game.
A14EVM49LCGZPI B0066T8M1I 4 1325635200 32 Works fine on Moto Cliq2.  Good gameplay, fair controls.  Graphics are really good for a board game.  Got it a the free app of the day, but would pay $2-$3 for it.
A14EVXIWP4QHV6 B00HDRTGDK 5 1391644800 24 I was born just before the 90s started so this is very interesting and somewhat challenging for me. We will see how I do!
A14EVXIWP4QHV6 B00CRLSN4U 5 1391644800 23 I think this app is really fun to play...some easy and some hard :) can't wait to see how far we can get!
A14EVXIWP4QHV6 B00DYY92MG 5 1391644800 20 Really enjoy this app. I am new to it so I can not wait to see how hard it gets.
A14EY1IX0O59CE B00992CF6W 5 1351468800 77 If you cant download or install this app, or if your creations suddenly disappear, CONTACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Noone is trying to &quot;rip you off&quot;. They have customer support for these reasons.If you're complaining about the price (you know, that whopping $6.99), GET A JOB. Maybe mow a lawn, walk some dogs, clean someones garage etc. I'm fairly certain the physical labor won't kill you and then you can buy this app.See, I'm a problem solver. You're welcome!
A14EY1IX0O59CE B004V6K38I 5 1329264000 66 I've had this game for over a month now. You don't really play it. It plays you. I check in on my hero a couple times a day. All the functions work well on my Kindle Fire, and it is oddly addicting. I find it funny and well thought out. The devs did a great job and I recommend it. It's free. Give it a go.
A14EYTLSMJRPUK B0067QCC70 5 1325808000 21 The game is very fun, after playing only a little while  I want to buy the full version and will soon.
A14EYTLSMJRPUK B007QTSROE 5 1337126400 20 great faotd definitely download it if u have the chance. It looks great and runs smoothly, just an awesome game.
A14EYTLSMJRPUK B009XAJI8S 4 1358294400 22 awesome free access to live Tv that works fairly well. as other reviewers have said sometimes channels don't work, BUT ITS FREE!!!!!!!
A14EYTLSMJRPUK B007V2UGPE 5 1337558400 24 really fun, i recommend  it and thats all i have to say... is that enough words? i hope so, the word min is stoopid!
A14F20H1HDF3I8 B009VSW15Y 5 1358294400 20 I love how simple and easy this app is and i use it faithfully for pictures to email. So smart.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004LZFWJO 4 1319846400 171 This game works just like it's supposed to on my Droid x. Graphics are clear &amp; cutesy, game runs smoothly, &amp; the permissions don't cause mass hysteria. After yesterday's insane rantings, that itself earns this game a star!I really like the swiping aspect of this game. That's the one thing that sets it apart that makes me like it more than I probably would have had it been a run of the mill bejeweled style game. It just helps the game flow better.The one thing I do wish was different about this game is that they should give you a definite goal. As it is right now, you just play until time runs out. I guess the goal is to beat your previous score?  To me that's just not fun. I'd much rather be given a goal to work towards in an allotted amount of time...makes things more interesting.I definitely don't think this game is worth $2.99, but for the FAOTD it's just fine. Try it out &amp; see for yourself!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B007NACZPI 5 1332460800 230 I don't understand how or why it costs money on here seeing as how: 1. It's a freemium type game. (Freemium meaning it's free, but they charge for in app premium items.) 2. It's free on Google Play. I've seen it a million times on there &amp; it costs nothing.I definitely would never have paid money for a game like this. I either want to pay up front &amp; get all aspects of the game for nothing, or it should be free if they're gonna charge for in game items. Pick one or the other, but to charge both ways is overkill imo. Makes you look like a douche, developer.Big Shirley has kept her large self occupied all day with this stinking game. She loves it, but she also loves to eat entirely too much. Games like this are her only joy in life, seeing as how her morbid obesity has her bedridden.Oh, &amp; she's forcing me to rate this app 5 stars. She says she gets 30 free gems if I do, &amp; if I refuse, she'll force me to scrub her fat rolls all day. She'll also start with her foul noxious gas attacks, &amp; the house won't be suitable to breathe in. My girlfriend's coming over, so I don't have time for those shenanigans.In conclusion, you get five stars... courtesy of my gigantic fat wife, Big Shirley.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B005URX4OC 5 1318377600 133 ...but it worked great for me. No issues...ran perfectly on my Droid X!It's one of those games where you shoot at the ball bouncing around, (except in this case the ball is a ball-shaped cow.) You also gotta dodge the ball. When you shoot it, it separates into smaller balls that bounce around &amp; you have to shoot them, too. Obviously, the higher the level, the more balls, &amp; the harder it gets.It's safe to say everyone has played a game like this at least once. This game works good &amp; looks good. Unfortunately, I really kind of hate this type of game, but I felt it deserved a fair review. For what it is, it works well. If you like this kind of game, shell over the measly 99&cent; &amp; buy it!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B005KN7NQ6 2 1349395200 677 Disclaimer: this is gonna be long!I saw this &amp; was so excited, thinking my 3 year old son would love it. He loves when I get him a new game for my phone. This game looked very similar to an old Smart Cycle game my older son used to have. While he didn't care for it, my youngest son loved that stupid thing, &amp; played that game until he wore it out completely. When I showed him this, he noticed the similarity as well, &amp; was super excited to play it.Unfortunately, that's about the extent of anything positive I can really say about this app. Before we even started, I put my phone on airplane mode as I usually do when an app has unnecessary permissions like this one. Thankfully I did, because the first thing he did was accidentally push the link to the app store that's right below the button you have to push to enter the game. Us adult phone/tablet owners know very well how to get to the app store without your help, &amp; I hate the fact that people try to cash in on little fingers making accidental purchases. I have my account locked because my kids do use my phone sometimes, but I know there are people who are extremely technologically naive who don't know to do that. A grandma gets a new tablet &amp; sees this cute game for her grandson...installs it without thinking twice about it...then 5 minutes later, without her knowing, he's wreaked havoc on her cc account. It's just despicable to include links to anything in an app that's for small children, &amp; the developers who do so know very well that they're going to be raking in money from accidental purchases.With that out of the way, let's talk about the actual gameplay...The very first thing I noticed was HORRIBLE touch response. Steering worked very well, but to shift to slow down, or to push any menu buttons at all, we had to push them repeatedly. My son absolutely couldn't slow it down on his own. He's a &quot;let me do it myself&quot; type of kid, &amp; he tried very hard to do it multiple times, but he finally had to ask me to do it. The shifter is small, (smaller than their link to the app store!) which is hard enough for a toddler, but it also just doesn't respond most of the time. I had to do it numerous times before it actually worked. I played the game again then to see if it was just a one time thing, but once again I had to repeatedly push level/menu buttons, &amp; once again the shifter didn't respond well. Besides all of that, we also had it lag quite a few times. I don't experience lag on any other games on my phone, &amp; one this simple I definitely shouldn't.Regardless of all of that, I always give very fair reviews, &amp; would've rated much higher had my son actually enjoyed it. I showed him what to do, then let him have at it. He only played a few minutes before he got frustrated that it was repeating the same words over again, so I put it on a different difficulty setting. After a few minutes...same issue. Then he gave me the phone &amp; told me to play...said he didn't like it. Later this evening I asked if he'd like to try it again. He refused. I don't let him sit &amp; play games on my phone near as often as he'd like to, so when I do, it's a special treat to him. He takes full advantage &amp; plays as long as I'll let him...even with games that aren't his favorite. For him to flat out refuse to play only means he absolutely hates it. Can't blame him...I thought it was sucktastic &amp; boring as can be.Tl;dr...Pros: cute graphics, educational, steering works really goodCons: gets very boring very quickly, touch response sucks, lags at times, way too easy for little fingers to accidentally access app store
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B00HAPRVWS 5 1404086400 27 Idk why the issues for so many people...this game runs great on my Galaxy Note 3. No issues what so ever. Just old school Sonic fun :)
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004T2QZL8 2 1332201600 136 First time I tried this it turned on, immediately shut itself off, but the sound continued until I force closed it. The second time it seemed to work except for this god awful clicking noise. It's very loud...much louder than the narrator, &amp; sounds much like a helicopter. Although the noise was making Big Paula howl like a donkey, I put ear plugs in &amp; played around with with it for a bit. After about 5 minutes it froze up completely &amp; I had to force close it again. Paula has now been sobbing all day, &amp; her hero Matt Lauer isn't on to cheer her up.  So, she's been squeezing me to death most of the day. Help, Doodle God! Update your app before my large &amp; in charge woman suffocates me in her bosoms!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004WOXGCO 5 1332028800 124 Moola, (or as we like to call it- Moomaw.) helped me greatly when planning our St. Patti's Day parade. (We spell Patti with an i for extra detail.) It was the most puce-filled parade our town has ever seen &amp; was full of unicycles of all girths &amp; roundnesses. We even had our best friend Matty Lauer there on his St. Patti's Day stilts we fashioned out of our pappy's antique fishing poles. Moomaw, we couldn't have celebrated such chub &amp; hot stinky breath without you! We even built a celebratory cow &amp; put a toothbrush in it's mouth to keep the stink at bay. They could smell you clean to Port Royal! Paula exclaimed, &quot;Pootinky!&quot; Moomaw, take a bath! We love you, Moomaw!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B0088QDDDY 4 1348617600 285 Although I really liked this game, there are a few things about it I didn't care for.Obviously the graphics are intended to be the 8 bit pixelated sort, so idk why anybody is complaining about that. It takes away nothing from the actual gameplay itself, &amp; it's easy to distinguish exactly what everything is. I was a kid during the 8 bit NES days, &amp; all I can say is thank god things have evolved. For an rpg or anything like that, going the 8 bit route sucks. But, with a game like this, the pixelated-ness doesn't bother me. Also, the fact that there are no permissions makes me like it even more.Now for the bad: First &amp; foremost, no replayability. You get through the entire thing in less than an hour, then you're done. Forever. Playing it again would be senseless, as you already know what to use where, etc. Also, you can't save your progress. If you have to stop in the middle of playing, next time you'll have to start all over. No big deal for such a short game, but still annoying. There's also no way to exit except for pushing your home button. If you push your back button, you get the options to continue, rate the game, or go to their website. Nothing else. That's just irritating to me.Overall, this is an amazingly fun game...while it lasts. Because of the extremely short amount of time you get to play it, I'd never actually pay for it. I'll keep it to let the kids check it out, then it goes back to the cloud. Make a much longer version, &amp; I'd gladly pay for it!Great faotd, regardless of anything else!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004ECDNJU 5 1325462400 307 This was actually a very good, fun little game! Judging by the reviews I thought it might suck, but it just goes to show the level of intelligence &amp; competence on here. (&amp; I'm not talking about superman75, either. Keep on trolling as far as I'm concerned! You're funny &amp; entertaining, &amp; a good break from the moronic ranting that's usually on here.)This game is definitely not just a remake of  one of the same old crap games circulating on the android market. It's something new that's hard enough to make it a challenge, but not so hard that it's not enjoyable. For a casual game I like it, &amp; if I cared to play casual games I'd definitely keep it around.Game play goes something like this:  There are several things that look like pots...some that have colors on them, &amp; some that have arrows. Each pot has openings on a couple different sides. A dragon breathes colored fire towards one of the pots with an arrow on it. You have to direct the colored fire to the same colored pot by pointing the arrows in the correct direction. It will go in one opening &amp; out the other to the next pot you're aimed at. Once the colored fire gets into its colored pot, the pot will close &amp; is done. The aim is to close them all without getting wrong colors into the wrong pots. Depending on what level you're on, there can be a lot of arrows &amp; once you get one color into its pot, it changes color several times before it's done &amp; closes. The game progresses quickly, but isn't as hard as it first looks. It does get quite challenging afterwhile, though, which is always good.Overall, definitely a good game for any casual gamer. Anyone with any intelligence won't be disappointed!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004S33RRI 4 1303171200 440 Let me start by saying I rarely ever review apps unless they really impress me. I just felt like this one deserved a fair,unbiased review. I have no ties to the developer. I just found it kinda weird that almost every bad review mentioned the app being in beta. That's not something that most normal people would mention or know about. I hope people will take advantage of it being free today, give honest reviews, &amp; the dev. will get some of the credit they deserve.I found only one fault with this app &amp; that was that they give you no instruction. You just gotta click around &amp; figure things out. There's a lot to this app, so figuring it out on your own is a pain.  Give instructions &amp; I'll gladly give a 5 star review. Regardless, it's a great app &amp; works great for what it's intended for. I especially love how very detailed it is...like it literally has every option you could ever want in a grocery list app.Those who said &quot;a pen &amp; paper is easier&quot; probably have little clue how to even use something like this the way it was intended. I know for myself, if it's not in my phone or on my ipad, I won't remember it. Something like this is essential for me, &amp; makes my life much more simple. I have 3 kids, so the last thing I wanna have to worry about is forgetting my shopping list at home.The other main thing I wanted to address is people's complaints about the scanner not working. I have a droid x...the same as one of the reviewers who said it didn't work. I stood here &amp; scanned a lot of the stuff in my kitchen cupboards...from cereal to dog treats, &amp; even some cleaners. Everything scanned quickly &amp; accurately. It recognized every single name brand item. The only things it didn't recognize were store brand items, which I sort of expected. The other scanners I've used don't recognize those, either.  It did read them correctly, however... it just didn't recognize what the product name was. I even scanned local things I know aren't sold everywhere, (Middleswarth chips for example,) &amp; it recognized those. I have no clue what the problem is for those people who can't get it to work.If you're looking for an app like this, give it a try. They don't require unnecessary permissions &amp; they don't ask for personal info. It's free today, so try it out &amp; get some real reviews &amp; constructive criticism on here so it can become an even better app than it already is!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B0054QY36C 5 1340668800 123 She won't even let me install this app. She thinks Amazon is out to get her because she is a &quot;curvy&quot; woman. (400 lbs. worth of curves to be exact.) She's been on her fatty scooter crying all day because of this app, meaning she isn't forcing me to pay attention to her, make her insane amounts of pizza, or clean her fat rolls. Thank you, whoever made this app for allowing me to be free from the clutches of my gigantor wife today! I may just get the chance to go out &amp; ride my unicycle. Please continue to put apps like this as faotd so that I can remain a free man. I may even get to rescue Matt Lauer afterall!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006D1ONE4 5 1324857600 63 Bought it when it was 10&cent; on the android market, &amp; it's free today, but it's totally worth the money they charge for it. It's fun, addicting, &amp; gets you thinking. Plus, (at least on the android market) they've updated with new levels at least once in only a couple weeks' time. Great game! Hope to see more from them in the future!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006H7TC3Q 5 1337817600 164 Idk what problems others claim to be having, because this worked flawlessly for me. I tried it with pictures I already had, &amp; took new ones with the app. (Although, I simply refuse to try it with Paula's obese, flab flapping picture. Even if I could fit her all on the screen, I'm positive this app will curl up &amp; die right then &amp; there.)  Anyways, I tried every setting, &amp; the brightness/contrast adjustment with each one. All of it worked perfectly. That being said, a lot of camera apps come with a sketch option, &amp; none of these are really any different than that. I just don't see paying an extra price for just this. For free, though, it's great.I'd say 99.7% of people having problems with this not working either have craptastic phones/tablets, (I'm looking at you, LG Optimus) or they're like 10 years old &amp; have their phones/tablets so full of crappy, malware ridden apps that they can't process anything correctly.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B007TML2EK 4 1343865600 209 Did I like this app? No. Does it do exactly what the description says? Absolutely. I'm not gonna penalize an app for doing exactly what they're setting out to do, just because I don't care for it. Logic.I was desperately hoping for a gardening guide...meaning help &amp; tips. That's not what this is, nor what it claims to be. The title is extremely misleading, but their description specifically states that it has quizzes, flashcards, &amp; that you can make your own quizzes, &amp; it absolutely does do all of that.  Nowhere does it claim to give any other information. My reasoning for taking any stars off was because to close it, I couldn't just go to the app's home screen &amp; push my back button. I did that, &amp; had to proceed to actually keep backing out of every single thing I had looked at while on the app. So, fix that &amp; there's really nothing I personally could complain about.While this isn't what I had hoped for, it does what it says. Nothing wrong with that. I honestly don't know who would want a bunch of quizzes about gardening, but if that's your kind of thing...READ THE DESCRIPTION. If it sounds good, it's probably what you're looking for.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006C8EVHM 5 1342051200 25 I've played a lot of word game apps, &amp; this is the only one I've found that accepts cuss words. 5 stars just for that.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006RA13BW 3 1333411200 286 She hated it so bad she cried. She looked &amp; sounded like a beached orca. While I don't care about her feelings, I do care that I'll likely be forced to scrub her rolls &amp; many gigantic crevices as a result of her being emotional. That makes my life miserable, &amp; takes away from spending time with my normal sized girlfriend. That makes my initial impression of this app not a good one. Also, I was going to keep this for my 3 year old to play with until I noticed two big annoyances. First of all, you have to push the home button to exit. Therefore, I'd have to go in &amp; force close it every single time it's used. That's a huge PITA, &amp; no app is worth having if you have to do that. The second thing is that there was no pushing the balloons around for me. They all wanted to pop when I tried. Once in a great while it would bounce around, but 99% of the time it just popped. If it annoyed me, I know my son would've been twice as irritated. No wonder my heffer wife cried. She's irrational, &amp; every little irritation makes her sob like some type of huge rain cloud. She's just a massive, emotional she-beast.Anyways, there are a few pros to this thing. It doesn't require any permissions, which is nice for a change. It is semi fun to blow up &amp; pop the balloons, &amp; the  black starry background is nice. It's just very very simple. Definitely not enough something I'd ever pay money for unless they added or improved on it somehow. Or, if it can make my humongous significant other disappear.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B00885MDHM 1 1343779200 192 The ridiculous list of permissions are bad enough, but add to that the fact that this runs in the background after you exit, &amp; you're hit with a full page ad right off the bat, &amp; you've already lost my desire to play this crap fest. Regardless, I gave it a try, hoping that it would redeem itself.Nope! It's your run of the mill tanagrams game, which is ok. The thing that made me absolutely 100% hate it, though, is that your pieces move around from the slightest bump. There's no locking them in place once you have them where you want them. Might not be a big deal on the first few puzzles, but once you get to one that has multiple pieces, it can be a huge PITA. You can have every piece in its place except one, then accidentally bump it with your last piece &amp; they all move. It's just annoying.I gotta admit I would've been much more lenient on gameplay had they not incorporated so much crap into this app, as I mentioned above. Wouldn't keep this on my phone, even if I loved the game. Uninstalled.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B007HBA70S 5 1338595200 58 &amp; hid her fatty scooter so she couldn't get out of bed. I wanted to check out this game that bad. Love HeroCraft games usually. This one...for free especially...is great. I'm not a fan of bejeweled or hidden object games, but in this setting...with a back story &amp; other crap you have to do...I actually am enjoying it.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B00AKKTDJY 1 1368662400 200 Got This As Faotd &amp; Saw The Reviews Of People Complaining That This Isn't A Full Game. I Played It A Good Bit Yesterday, &amp; It Was Indeed The Full Game. I knew So Many People Couldn't Be Mistaken Or Full Of It, So I Was Honestly Expecting To See An Update In The Future Taking Back The Full Game They Obviously Included In Order To Avoid Bad Reviews. Only One Day Later &amp; We Have The Update Already. Thankfully I Checked Reviews First, &amp; Big Surprise...They've Reverted It Back To A .99 Demo. Ridiculous, Despicable Business Practices. you Blatantly Ripped People Off By Charging Then For A Demo They Could've Gotten Elsewhere For Free. Then You Give The Full Game Away In Order To Avoid Being Called Out On Pulling Crap Like That. Then, When Risk Of Hundreds Of 1 Star Reviews Is Out Of The Way, You Try To Swoop In &amp; Take The Full Game Back. I've Bought My Daughter Countless Dinner Dash Type Games On Ios, (Where Demos Are Free Like They Should Be,) But This CompanyWon't Get One More Cent Of My Money. I Don't Care How Much You Enjoy These Games...Don't Install This One!!!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004N2NWT2 5 1303257600 128 Whoever was complaining about having to register is a moron. You CAN log in with open feint at the beginning if you want, or you can click on the &quot;no thanks&quot; option at the bottom left &amp; just play without doing anything.This is a good little time killer. It's entertaining &amp; gives you something challenging to do for a few minutes or so. Personally I get sick of it after a little while, but I can see where it can be addicting for some people...I just prefer more serious, in depth games.  This is great for standing in line at the store or something, though.For what it is, it's a great app &amp; lives up to its intended purpose very well. It's free today, so try it out.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004ALVL6W 5 1331424000 197 This game works just fine! When you go to start a level there is a paragraph that says right at the end that you HAVE TO HAVE POWER STATIONS to power your towers! Otherwise, yes, they'll only shoot once. It was obvious after playing around for only 5 minutes exactly what tower did what, &amp; how well everything worked. For those of you who can't read or have no common sense: the first little icon shoots one bullet at a time at incoming enemies.  Next icon, (ship wheel looking thing,) shoots out in all directions. Fire icon melts ice balls that will eventually come, or shoots one bullet at regular ones. Blue spiral thing...can't remember. Hot air balloon follows enemies &amp; shoots at them. Finally, the red power icon sets up a power station.While this game may not be goty material, nor is it amazing graphics-wise (they aren't bad, just simple) it's still a good tower defense game. With other higher quality TD games on the market, this one definitely isn't worth $2.99. It isn't worth the ridiculous reviews from a bunch of morons who haven't given it more than 10 seconds worth of play time, either!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006ON41FC 5 1329436800 258 ...but LOVE this one! These guys did things right &amp; made a super fun game. For an app the graphics are great. (Moron who said it has gamecube like graphics...is that supposed to be a bad thing? Do you even know what you're talking about? Cuz the gamecube is just a step below the wii as far as graphics go, &amp; for a mobile game, gamecube level graphics are definitely NOT a bad thing.)Since today is jump on the open feint bandwagon day, I'll add my 2 cents. I agree open feint should always be optional, but I'm not gonna act like a 2 yr. old &amp; one star an amazing game because of it. Afterall, it's open feint...not spyware or some fishy permission. I will email the developer like a mature human being. That way they have a chance to fix things without their ratings being trashed before they even know people have an issue with it. Sad thing is maybe one out of all of you whiners will actually come edit your review if/when they do update it. So the ratings will stick &amp; sales will go down because you're a bunch of selfish, thoughtless drones.If you're thinking of buying this game when it's no longer faotd, it's well worth 99&cent;. If the open feint thing bothers you, check &amp; see if they've updated it. It's a great game that I hope isn't ruined just because the IQ of most of these sheeple doesn't allow them to think for themselves.Fun game, devs! Hope to see more!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006SMLAMQ 5 1332115200 118 This was great the day Matt Lauer decided to roll his salad bowl/bagel combo through the Atlantic Ocean on his way to interview me &amp; my cousin &amp; my mom &amp; my aunt, (we call them the moomallahs.) Anyways, Matty got lost &amp; we couldn't find him. We asked Al Roker, who hopped on his bagel &amp; used his Weather + app to find his dear confidante. There was Al &amp; Matt bobbing up &amp; down in the ocean, clinging to their bagels for dear life. They made it home safe &amp; sound, then we made up a song to commemorate the expedition. &quot;Matty Lauer in your salad bowl. Let it roll! Let it roll! Where's your pole?!&quot;
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B007ZSADMK 3 1350086400 205 I liked the game. It's not an Angry Birds or Cut the Rope knock off. If anything, it's more similar to Amazing Alex. In case you didn't know, those games weren't originals, either...physics games have been around for quite some time. That being said, this game is enjoyable &amp; works well. Sounds worked on my phone, &amp; for whoever said there's no option to turn them off...there's a little i in the bottom left hand corner of the title screen. Click on it for the option to turn off sounds.The only bad thing about this game is its permissions. No links to facebook or twitter, no sharing scores with friends, etc. While that's a good thing &amp; I'd rather not have those options, it really makes the permissions all the more unnecessary. Why would anybody shut their mouths about it? We should just trust a stranger, &amp; knowing full well that he could, we should shut our mouth &amp; hope he's not stealing our info? Lmao...have fun finding anybody who agrees with that ridiculous logic.This game will gladly get 5 stars from me if the unnecessary permissions are taken out. I like the game a lot, but it's not worth having my information  potentially stolen.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B007TLOYZU 5 1337299200 285 Nowhere in this game are you forced to buy anything. There is an option to pay for solutions to levels, or to unlock levels without actually beating them. You get a couple for free, then, IF YOU WANT TO, you can go to the menu to choose to purchase such things...very similar to how you can pay for Angry Birds level unlocker apps or solution guides. Had any of you spent ten seconds on this game you'd have seen that.As far as gameplay, it's actually really good. You're given a certain number of grenades to blow up enemies with, &amp; you want to blow them all up using the least about of grenades. There are different obstacles, etc. to make things more interesting in each level. You set the power &amp; angle of your throw &amp; let them fly.The only real complaint I have with this app is the size. Put that up against all the positive things this game has going for it, though, &amp; you can very easily overlook the size. (Plus the fact that newer phones/tablets have insane amounts of memory.) They aren't shoving open feint in your face, which is always a plus. The permissions are bare minimum, which is something we see not nearly often enough. Although they do offer things for purchase, they aren't shoving it down your throat constantly. Had so many of you pieces of crap not complained about it, I wouldn't have even noticed it.I'll be honest, this game is not for me just because I don't enjoy these types of games that much. However, if you're a fan of the genre, you'll love it for sure. Definitely worth the money, &amp; definitely a great FAotD!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B005Z4BGY0 5 1332288000 63 The behemoth I call my wife has left me alone all morning long. I haven't had to listen to her bugging me to clean out her fat rolls, or her yelling at me to spray Febreze after her constant noxious gas attacks. This game has kept her busy for hours &amp; I've heard nothing but beautiful music all morning long. Thank you, HeroCraft!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B0052UZIFA 5 1306800000 55 Like this game a lot, &amp; was pleasantly surprised to see it was the FAOTD today. Even though it says it might not work on Droid x, I figured it was worth a shot. Well, it worked just fine for me. There was a bit of initial lag, but after that ran pretty much flawlessly.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B00768WTXA 2 1359417600 289 Sorry, but this is the worst &quot;hidden object game&quot; I've ever seen. I don't like these types of games as it is, &amp; normally i just wouldn't review a game i don't like, but this one straight up sucks. First of all you can finish it in like 20 minutes. Seriously. Nothing is really hidden...some are very obvious &amp; the rest are just kind of transparent. A few were practically invisible. It's the same crap flung everywhere over &amp; over...&quot;find 20 birds, find 20 butterflies, etc.&quot; Some of the objects were so far to the sides/top/bottom that they weren't even visible. You don't get any hints until you find all except the last thing, then you get one hint to find it. Probably the most obnoxious part of this game is the stupid thing that pops up constantly to stop you from clicking around too fast. I get that it's their way to stop you from clicking around randomly, but it does it constantly, even if you're actually clicking on the objects. I even had it pop up after clicking the very first object on a couple levels. It stays on the screen for a couple of seconds &amp; just gets annoying. At the beginning of a level you can easily see some of the things you're supposed to find. It gets really irritating having that stupid thing pop up just because you're finding things too fast. It's not like it penalizes you for random clicking anyways, so idk what the point is.The game is very pretty &amp; I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy the music. In my opinion, though, it stinks. If hidden object games is your thing, I'd advise you to pick a different one!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004Q6Y2LM 5 1306281600 378 I was glad to see this was free today, since I've already been playing the lite version. This is one of those simplistic games that can get addicting. It starts out very easy, with difficulty increasing as you go. I've only played the first 10 or so levels, so I can't say exactly how challenging they become...i just know it's still quite simple for me at level 10. To say it's for kids, though, if definitely not accurate. Kids in their teens may enjoy it, but it's definitely not something that would be suitable for the 10 &amp; under crowd past the first few levels.  The moron who said it's &quot;too pokeman&quot; (their words, not mine,) just showed what a nitwit they obviously are by saying that. Not only is it called Pokemon, but it's in no way a close comparison to this game. Actually, I'm 30 &amp; I love pokemon. It's a very in depth game...like no other...&amp; is greatly enjoyed by many adults &amp; kids alike. You've obviously never played it, so don't base your review on something you know nothing about. I'm used to morons leaving b.s. reviews on here, but it does get old. Also, for the umpteenth time, AMAZON DOES NOT CHARGE YOU! They do ask for your cc info for future purchases, &amp; just so orders, (even free ones,) can be processed the same way. You always get a receipt for $0.00. We've gotten a ton of free apps from here &amp; haven't had any issues. Quit saying they want to charge you, because they don't! If you'd read what it says,  they explain it. I know for some of you that's difficult, but just try.Anyways, this is a good game. It ran well on my Droid x every time I've played it. The controls are simple, there's no lag, &amp; it doesn't restart or freeze my phone as others have said. Idk what their problem if, cuz it seriously works great on my phone.While this isn't my favorite, this is a good, simple little game to keep you occupied. The graphics are cutesy, but  they're clean &amp; clear, &amp; for what the game is, that helps. Definitely worth $.99, &amp; definitely not worth complaining about if you got it for free!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B0050D6PH4 5 1306108800 183 Don't know what other people's problem is cuz I have a Droid x &amp; it worked flawlessly for me. You tap 2 or more of the same color bubbles to pop them. It makes a fun popping sound that I find awesome for whatever reason. It's a good, simple time waster that works great. I had no problems with lag or anything. There are leaderboards, &amp; you can send scores to facebook or twitter if you want to.Is this my favorite type of game? Definitely not, but I'm mature enough to rate the game for what it is &amp; how it works, &amp; not whine that Amazon isn't catering to my every selfish whim. They seem to try to please everybody by giving a really good variety of apps, which is something they don't have to do at all. People complaining that they're not handing out they're favorites everyday need to grow up &amp; realize life isn't all about them. If your immature enough to whine about something you get for free, I can't wait until life really kicks you in the -ss.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004W89LGU 5 1307318400 259 This is truly a good game. I've had the free version for quite some time, so I was extremely happy to get the paid version for free today!I'll admit, this is not the game I choose to play most of the time, but that's not cuz it isn't good...it just isn't my favorite game style. Regardless, it's a great game, &amp; would be very enjoyable for anyone.Yes, it's very easy at the beginning, but it does get harder. You have to get the pig, (or sometimes pigs,) from point a to point b, while avoiding enemies &amp; obstacles, &amp; while picking up coins &amp; other things you'll need. Watch the video they have on here...it shows perfectly just what the game is like.This game looks good, runs perfectly on my Droid x, &amp; despite what someone else said, the controls are extremely easy. It has a back story to keep it interesting, &amp; great game play to back it up. It's easily worth the dollar it normally costs, so you shouldn't pass it up while it's free!*On a side note...I've decided to email Amazon. I'm done explaining one click on here. I've explained it every single day now &amp; people still don't get it. They're too stupid to understand plain english obviously, &amp; they're down rating every single game because of it. Amazon needs to disable reviewing for people who haven't even installed the game. It would be nice &amp; very helpful if some of you, (who are sick of it like I am,) would email them too! Thanks!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B008OOYALE 1 1344556800 26 Lag was horrendous from the get go, &amp; everytime I'd go to build the first habitat it force closed. Once it's fixed I'll change my review.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B00AO5WLIU 1 1364169600 145 I don't care how good the app is...banner ads in a supposedly paid game= ridiculous. No, it's not ads for their games either...I ran into those, too. (They're annoying enough. They pop up in the middle of the screen &amp; you have to x them off to go any further.)  The banner ad was for Paypal actually, &amp; was a definite ad. This is not any different than their free version on Google Play. Besides a few exceptions we've gotten some really craptastic faotd's lately, but this is an all new low. Either Amazon has given us an already free app, or the developer thought they'd compensate their loss from giving it away, by putting ads in the paid version. Either way, they've ruined their rating &amp; chances are nobody is going to want to pay money for it in the future. Good job, dev.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B007JM4CWY 5 1337817600 180 I can hear Paula's immense fields of fat growing as I write this review. She hasn't moved off the couch even once today because she's been playing this. It's a great game, &amp; she doesn't move much as it is. Normally, though, she'd at least get her daily walk from the couch to her fatty scooter, &amp; she hasn't even done that today. At least she isn't pestering me to scrub under her folds &amp; rolls, &amp; asking me to wipe her nether regions. That reminds me...I better check her spot on the couch, cuz she'll just pee &amp; shart where she sits if you don't move her regularly. She's a foul chub-o-lard, &amp; she smells like a dirty hoagie. I'm sure as good as this game is, she won't move for days. Her obese whale flab will get sweaty &amp; covered in greasy food, coca cola, &amp; other bodily fluids, &amp; the house will be putrid in no time! I can always burn the house down. As long as she lets me alone, I'm a happy guy. Thanks, Dynamix!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004SZ1U66 5 1342310400 152 I was gonna buy this on my 3ds a couple weeks ago. So glad I waited! As far as the IAPs...I've been playing for a couple hours &amp; have yet to see anything to buy. You create your pottery. From start to finish everything...sculpting, painting, etc. works great &amp; is fun &amp; allows for a lot of creativity. Then you either sell it for coins, or you can fill orders you get in your inbox, which also earns you coins. The coins are used to purchase colors, designs, brushes, material, etc. Maybe you can purchase coins somewhere, but idk where, &amp; I can't find how it would possibly be necessary. So, once again...TRY the app before you review it!  So awesome, &amp; so worth the usual purchase price! I'll definitely be checking out their other apps &amp; won't hesitate next time I'm interested in buying one.Great faotd! Thanks, Infinite Dreams &amp; Amazon!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006HXUZJU 5 1349740800 137 At least when they give us an absolutely horrendous faotd, Amazon always redeems themselves by replacing it with something much better. Today is no exception, &amp; I was happy to get this after the monstrosity they had on earlier. So, thank you, Amazon! Much appreciated.This is a cute version of mahjong with farm animals, tractors, fruits &amp; vegetables, etc, instead of the usual symbols &amp; designs you normally see on mahjong games. It works very well, &amp; there are plenty of levels to keep you occupied for quite some time. My 3 year old sat down to check it out with me, &amp; really enjoyed it as well. He helped me find matching tiles, &amp; absolutely LOVED that the animals made noise when you got rid of a pair.Overall, good game...great replacement for the crap offered earlier!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B006P552CA 3 1336867200 134 The answer to that is nope.  Well, actually, kind of. I showed it to her, hoping she'd like it. She did. I told her it would be funner to take some real glass stuff &amp; go outside &amp; smash the ever loving bejesus out of it. I was hoping that would get her off of her 400 lb. monstrous arse &amp; get some physical exercise. She hatred the idea of moving, so she proceeded to pull random projectiles out of her many fat rolls &amp; throw them at me. Good thing is, I'm mobile &amp; without her fatty scooter she isn't. So, I jumped on her rascal &amp; scooteted away.  Then I heard her scream that this game has no way to exit &amp; needs to be force closed. Not cool, Toy Studio. Unacceptable.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004FOA84A 3 1309046400 49 I absolutely loved this game. Thankfully it was free, though, or I would've been disappointed. Just when it gets going, it's over! I was hoping there'd be another one like it, but no such luck. Make another one, or make this one longer! Not worth paying for as is.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B005SE8IFW 1 1341014400 374 Didn't work right at all. I uploaded a picture no problem, but when I went to color the area I wanted colored, instead of filing in the color it was supposed to be, it actually copied a different part of the picture to that spot. I used a picture from my son's birthday where he was sitting on the living room floor opening gifts. I was trying to colorize the wrapping paper. Instead of doing that, it copied the tv that was above &amp; behind him. Not only that, but it would only let me color one specific spot on the picture. So, what it did was color a perfect square right below my son with a copy of the tv from the top right of the picture. Stupid. So, I scrapped that, exited the app, turned it on again, &amp; tried a different picture. Same thing...instead of coloring where I wanted, it copied a different part of the picture to one little square at the bottom left.That would be bad enough, but the real kicker was when I went to uninstall. I noticed the app was running in the background. I forced closed &amp; uninstalled immediately, then got into my files &amp; deleted anything potentially associated with this app. With such heinous permissions, I was wary to install this as it is, but did anyways just to try it out. Never again will I do that. Potentially harmful &amp; definitely intrusive permissions, the fact that it didn't work, (there's also no instructions, &amp; it seemed very slapped together,) &amp; the fact that it kept running in the background, (no I did not, nor do I ever push the home button to close an app,) makes me think this app is doing exactly what they claim they're not...mining your data.  It seems like it would be a cool app, but it's not worth it. Please think about this one before installing! Just because they say they aren't using your personal info doesn't mean they aren't. You just gonna take a stranger's word for it? I knew I was taking a risk, &amp; was hoping it would prove me wrong. I'll never do that again.My advice...stay as far away from this crapp as you can!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B00701L5XS 1 1342569600 106 This would've been so cool, but I'm not willing to have my info stolen just so I can learn some knots. Open feint, even if it wasn't such a load of crap, is only for games. This app has no purpose for having it. Papaya is the same, only much much worse. This has both, plus many more. This developing company is a front. All of you giving it five stars better rethink your decision on this one! Amazon, check out your friggin apps! Never using you to actually purchase one again unless you start doing a better job. This is constantly happening &amp; it's ridiculous!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B0089ZM1GY 5 1341446400 391 Maybe check out an app before you down rate it for IAPs. Unlike some apps that require you to buy something in order to progress, this one only has 2 (totally legit) things you can buy as far as I can see, &amp; they aren't very obvious &amp; in your face about it. First of all, you can gift the app to someone else from in the app, so that's one of the purchases you can make. The second thing you can buy is butterflies. They allow you to unlock the last world without having to play the previous levels, or they give you hints. I've played only the first half of the first world levels &amp; already have earned 10 butterflies. It only costs 30 to unlock the last world, so I'm certain I'll easily earn enough just by playing the game. So, they obviously aren't necessary. Big freaking deal. You people one starring an app because of IAPs are dumb, &amp; are probably the same morons who loved the photo editing &amp; mahjong apps, even with their intrusive permissions. It's ok if they steal your info, so long as it's free, right? But an honest developer giving you a good game...god forbid he give you an option to buy something! I hope you all don't play Angry Birds, either, since they have *gasp* in app purchases! You can buy the mighty eagle that helps you pass one level per hour. They also have Angry Birds unlocker apps you can buy. This is no different! At least try it before you spew your nonsense.While it has a similar concept to Angry Birds &amp; many others, this game is different &amp; I like it. You control a bird with your finger. You lead him to a rope, (or sometimes more than one rope,) which you then have to wind around spinning wheels, &amp; connect to a cage full of baby birds. Once connected, the baby birds are able to be freed. You want to use the least amount of rope possible, &amp; have to dodge knives, fireballs, &amp; other things. From the menu you can get to the bird sanctuary where you've can see all the cute baby birds you freed. It's a fun little game &amp; different from the rest, so I like it. I'll definitely be keeping this one!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B005F11PEY 5 1312416000 244 First I just wanna say great title! To the prude who called it ignorant...get a sense of humor. Also, to the Open Feint haters....it&apos;s always optional! You don&apos;t have to make an account, or use it even if you have one. Now on to my review...\n\nI&apos;ve played this quite a bit this morning. The screen got a little choppy during the tutorial, (Droid x,) but everything worked perfectly fine after that. I haven&apos;t had any of the issues other people have had. \n\nThe gameplay itself is ok. The purpose is to shoot at the balls &amp; squares coming at you, (&amp; every so often a ginormous ball,) &amp; keep them away from your cannon. If they hit your cannon it&apos;s game over. It is entertaining, &amp; I&apos;ve enjoyed trying to beat my previous time &amp; unlocking other levels. In order to unlock other levels you have to accumulate a certain amount of balls. For example, the 2nd level requires 1,000 balls to unlock it. You earn balls according to how long you can last. 20 seconds=20 balls, 40 seconds=40 balls, but then 1 minute=100, 2 minutes=200, &amp; so on. \n\nThe concept of this game is nothing new, but the execution is definitely original, &amp; that&apos;s what makes it fun. It&apos;s another time killer to add to the collection, but not something I personally would pay money for. If this is your type of game, though, by all means buy it. You won&apos;t be disappointed.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B0080SC22I 1 1344384000 253 Everytime you put your finger on the screen to move around it counts as a tap. For this type of game that's beyond ridiculous. Once you get too many, (which happens easily since the point of the game is to find things you have to move around to look for,) you get penalized. Every other game in the universe can tell the difference between a tap &amp; holding onto the screen to move it around. For a company that sells as many games as Nevosoft, it shouldn't be an issue to hire a programmer to do things right. Not only is that a HUGE issue, but there have been quite a few objects I found, &amp; had to tap on multiple times before it acknowledged I was tapping on the right thing. It got annoying really quickly...like within the first minute. Still, I gave it a chance. Once I got to the first side by side thing, (where you have to find the differences,) &amp; you couldn't even zoom in, I couldn't stand to play it any longer.I hate hidden object games, but I give everything a fair chance. Had this worked properly I'd have gladly given it five stars. Right off the bat, though, it stank on ice. Can't wait for the other reviews today. Evidently the bad reviews by the unfortunate people who actually paid money for this crap didn't make any difference to you. Maybe you morons will make a few changes once you see it's gonna affect your pocketbooks.
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004UBUK4Q 5 1304121600 59 If you like tower defense games, you'll love this. Even if you don't, give this a try. Just about anyone could try this &amp; enjoy it. It's so simple, while also keeping you entertained from start to finish. Very good take on a genre that's been done a million different ways. I'll be enjoying this one for quite awhile!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B008HSOT18 5 1344470400 49 You can choose level of difficulty, size of fleet, &amp; your competitor, (which determines how well ai does...read app's description to get an idea of what each one is like.) No permissions. Works perfectly. Not a single thing bad about this game. If you like Battleship, you'll love this!
A14F48IKL7GHLQ B004XNPQUO 5 1330646400 180 Adobe Air is NOT necessary, either, btw. I don't have it installed & it still works perfectly fine. I don't even like shooters & I really liked this. It's the type where there are planets, & the planets' gravity affects where your ammo goes. Figured I'd be bored with it, but ended up spending quite a while playing it. Looks nice, plays nice, & kept my interest. If you're a fan of shooting games, you won't be disappointed!To the two grumpers complaining about games being for kids, & not intelligent, wealthy adults....well, I'm an adult, & I want games! That's why they give us a variety of apps AND games. There are plenty of us adults who are also intelligent, went to college, & have great jobs, who love games! Heck, the main reason I spent so much on a phone like this is so I can play games on it. They aren't just for kids, (what a stupid thing to say,) & for someone to say they are, I have to assume you're either very old or very boring.
A14F6FW9ZHH3MZ B004SH9JSU 4 1373500800 23 the game is fun to play and relaxing.  Wish there was an easier way to get the gold.  I do like playing poker
A14F6FW9ZHH3MZ B00AMEFZ72 5 1374624000 21 fun to play. like the different patterns.recommend for all hinging lovers who love fast part and no problems like other games.
A14F6FW9ZHH3MZ B00DUGCLY4 4 1404950400 23 Good game very challenging. Can be addictive and hard to put down. Recommend to do to calm your nerves and during quite time
A14F706U72MVMD B00AHUEUGS 4 1357689600 31 It is a good game a little todark hard to see sometimes I do like to play it Iwill play the game till the end and maybe start it again sometime.
A14F706U72MVMD B006P2Y2QK 2 1356307200 20 just do not care for this one to simple not much to say will not play this one anymore .
A14F706U72MVMD B0067Q4DPE 5 1356307200 21 I like the majong games easy to play and keeps You going.I like the variety in this game.and keeps You going
A14F706U72MVMD B00EGY1WN0 1 1384473600 23 This is not a book that I will read after the first couple of pages I quit this book just not for me
A14F9C7NU8WJBM B00ARRDTX6 3 1366243200 21 Puzzles little to simple and you don't know it until you've downloaded it, but everything else they will need help with.
A14F9CIVKXODZE B00DY76ZC8 1 1399507200 44 The reason it's bad stuff is because it's completley sad and inappropriate they say really bad words and show women in bikinis having a kiss off do not get this app it is sodisturbingPlz do not get this app it . Is to much
A14F9CIVKXODZE B00AREIAI8 5 1401580800 20 I love it so fun to play and compete in horse shows! My favorite game, i would deffinitly recomend it!!!!!
A14FCT0NXFTMU3 B00DJFIMW6 4 1397433600 32 I love this game it's fun for kids and all ages but I wish they made a few more maps or a new power up but it's still a lot of fun
A14FCT0NXFTMU3 B00FT8FRO2 4 1397260800 31 It's ok but there's one teeny problem...  it's so hard to find food and that's how I usually die but otherwise it's cool ( it's also hard to find more )
A14FCT0NXFTMU3 B00HY5QKHQ 4 1400803200 45 The game is pretty good there a lot of more monsters and stuff but now there's no sound effects like when u swing your sword it sounds like someone hitting thin air (or at least trying to ) but the game itself is completely awesome
A14FCT0NXFTMU3 B00ED4TX2A 4 1399680000 20 One of the best games I got but u need energy to play and in a snap energy is gone
A14FCT0NXFTMU3 B00FRQ32N4 4 1402963200 78 It's great and easy to control lots action so much fun. But when you first get it there's endless adds and the way to stop that is to open it from the app store and then you should be fine and if it won't open up (meaning the app) shut down your tablet or whatever you use and wait 5 minutes and turn it on and you should be able to play. But it still a good/great app.(game)
A14FDL3S0P4C08 B00DJFIMW6 4 1399680000 30 This is fun but it also glitches on you. I would get this only if you want to die a lot. Also it is not as good as you think
A14FDL3S0P4C08 B00E3CFTJS 5 1390348800 24 It is the best thing in the world I can tell you it is recommended to all ages and will never be forgotten about!!!!
A14FEOYT9GZOU1 B00BMK357W 2 1379894400 57 Starting with level 30 it was basically impossible.  That bubble that adds a fruit with every shot makes it too complicated and by the time it is removed you only have a couple fruits left.  Maybe if you purchase a bunch of extra but I don't think I should be forced to do so to move forward.
A14FEOYT9GZOU1 B0088QGB7Y 3 1357430400 40 I find it frustrating that after playing this game for so long without logging into facebook and now this latest papa snuff quest is forcing the issue.  I must now log into facebook to visit another village to move forward.
A14FEOYT9GZOU1 B00ESNW58K 1 1387238400 91 When I first got this game I realized that the in app purchases for &#34;crystals&#34; were very expensive.  But that was ok because there was enough else going on that for a free game I could avoid the issue.  Recently there was an update and the content seemed even better.  I was actually willing to purchase some &#34;crystals' but the developer has not given them too me and the game is at a stand still without them.  This game is a rip off, not even worth it for a free game.
A14FJ9BAUOKMAQ B00IFXI4LQ 5 1396742400 108 I wanted to play his game so much that I had to delete a lot of stuff just to free up enough memory so I could install it.....and, no regrets. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. I am an older player than most on here (64) and a woman. But I have become very hooked on this type of game, and Alawar is super. Really liked the story line and the hidden object scenes; great graphics.  Now my husband knows how I felt when he watched the Military Channel for hours, because I did the same with this game. Just sad that it had to end. LOVED IT!
A14FJ9BAUOKMAQ B00HG3VFYO 2 1400025600 84 Don't get me wrong; I only gave this game a  2 because of a glitch. I absolutely LOVED playing this game. Problem was, I got stuck on one of the mini-games. Nothing would work; and the usual SKIP button was nowhere to be found. I contacted Big Fish, who actually were quite helpful with some suggestions on what to do. Still nothing worked. Amazon was kind enough to refund my money. I'm just sorry I couldn't finish the game, because it was pretty awesome.
A14FKVPSE0F1LC B00FJLK3WU 3 1384732800 69 This is an energy based game and you don't get enough energy to play for very long. I enjoy this game very much. Only other issues I've had is trying to load areas takes awhile and I can not expand the forest escape. I'm running out of room for all this stuff and its one of the quests. Besides some minor issues I love the game lots of fun.
A14FKVPSE0F1LC B00I8Q77Y0 5 1396915200 21 This game is a lot of fun. It is a great way to pass time. Makes for a challenging fun time
A14FKVPSE0F1LC B008KMAJQU 4 1373932800 36 I would have given this game 5 stars but it occasionally crashes when. Play co-op multiplayer. Other than that I love this game. So much fun. I spend most of my free time on this game.
A14FKVPSE0F1LC B005KC664W 1 1368057600 54 It would be great if I was just starting out. This makes it way too easy. I don't need numbers highlighted to be able to play where is the challenge in that. I got bored very quickly and deleted this app. Don't waste your time unless you have never solved a sudoku puzzle before
A14FLTQNE32VVF B004N8W292 1 1381190400 30 Nothing really available with this ap.  only two free translations.  Many free books but most I can get free as kindle books.  I will stick with youversion and bible gateway.
A14FLTQNE32VVF B0063GSL60 5 1327104000 30 works just like the original game I played on windows xp.  great auto fill feature when you get to the point where you can put them all on the aces
A14FLTQNE32VVF B004HGK6FW 1 1342483200 30 I loved this game until it put porn on my kindle I uninstallled immediately.  player be warned.  the ad came on full screen and I couldn't get rid of it
A14FLTQNE32VVF B004MC8CA2 5 1326240000 21 I use it often.  wish NIV could be downloaded but I am sure that is a zondervan restrictionI highly recommend it.
A14FLTQNE32VVF B00CKW6FVE 3 1371340800 23 not as good as the original tetris.  I like a bit more strategy.  this requires very little when compared to the old version.
A14FM4CU7ZR6P0 B005HSL626 1 1377129600 22 whats to keep you from putting ads in on non free version lmao um sorry i severely hate ads deleting it now
A14FM4CU7ZR6P0 B00FAPF5U0 4 1383523200 23 would like it even better if there were more lives maybe 7 stock  lives otherwise its awesome. oh and i forgot ADDICTIVE lol
A14FM4CU7ZR6P0 B0099WWKTO 5 1370476800 29 I love this game my Dragon it's very fun. I Love my vordian forest Dragon I can't wait to get the other dragons and all the stuff for them.
A14FM4CU7ZR6P0 B005LIYX5Y 1 1377043200 24 its okay but the continuous ads suck deleting it im not bothering with this app anymore its a shame too i actually liked it.
A14FMI5M3U6XIE B00B5DLSMU 5 1377820800 62 I love the game & the interaction with playing against others. On this free version there are ads, if you upgrade there is no ads! You can message your oppenents which is COOL. the upgrade you have a log of Friends, and great statstic records, and a Champion Board. I love it and would highly suggest the upgrade if YOU like it!
A14FMI5M3U6XIE B00B7KKNI6 5 1376611200 52 Fun interactive game and you can communicate with the other player. I have the upgraded version which doesnt have the ads and I enjoy how it keeps track of my stats. I also like I can save player names as My Friends so I can continually invite them to play with me.
A14FMI5M3U6XIE B00ENTEP32 1 1381104000 38 I cant figure out how to play this game. I am a game lover but for the life of me I cant figure ir out. It took forever to download so I think maybe something is completely wrong.
A14FMI5M3U6XIE B00B9AGS42 4 1377820800 44 I have the free version, and have thought about upgrading but havent yet. Its an average Hidden Objects game, for free its a great time passer to play. I have played better, but I have also played worse. For a free game its good!
A14FMTI5Q73LPW B0063GSL60 5 1324944000 22 app works great, no complaints! thanks dev . not sure why you have a word minimum on these reviews. ..blah blah blah
A14FMTI5Q73LPW B004DPIEF6 3 1319932800 53 i have been laughing out loud at these reviews for 10 minutes! yes the app is a refreshing lighthearted change from the other recent free apps of the day, but I have to say I've had more fun reading the reviews! the app is cute but im not convinced. thanks for the laugh!
A14FMTI5Q73LPW B00514DIE0 5 1307232000 22 very very nice app! graphics are lovely and game works flawlessly. very refreshing game, Im almost considering checking out the paid version.
A14FMTI5Q73LPW B004RJMUJO 3 1325376000 40 i bought this version a while ago and honestly it gets boring. i just found the puss in boots version and love love love it! its by the same dev and its much more fun and the challenges are great!
A14FMTI5Q73LPW B007R41E8O 1 1334793600 41 just like everybody said it took 5 times of downloading the data pack for it to open the game, then all the dialogue boxes were just white boxes over the screen. there's something very wrong with this game. incredible 2 HTC
A14FMTI5Q73LPW B004FOA84A 3 1301875200 28 Fun game definitely worth 99 cents.  Takes up more than 16MB with no option to send to memory card. Nice graphics and even a little challenging at times
A14FPG5XSB473X B00769WNK8 4 1332633600 302 This game is GREAT!!! My husband got this for me cause I wanted Temple Run, wich I played on my daughters IPhone and loved. We play LineRunner on my Kindle Fire and we LOVE it!! At first I wasn't sure about it because I thought it looked stupid compared to TempleRun. I was WRONG. My husband and I were instantly argueing over wanting to play because neither of us could put it down! The game concept is simple. tap left side to roll and tap right side to jump or hold jump side to make longer jump! it's that simple, wich most ppl would know if they read directions first! As for the ppl sayin it's to fast or hurt's their eye's, it's supposed to be fast-paced hence (LineRUNNER!). When yr playing, don't be looking at everything together, focus on dude himself and tumbstones. fade out the scenery, its designed to confuse ya! The only thing I don't like about it is on my Kindle I cant share scores and compete with the rest of the world! At first I did'nt like that there was no end to the level's. but once I thought about it,if they made endings, there would'nt be about &quot;time&quot;. and I think it's funner to beat times than to just conquer levels! the game runs AWSOME on my KindleFire. I would recommend this game to EVERYONE, even my 3 yr. old nephew play's!! over all it's great for ppl with good hand-eye coordination or if you want to improve your's. I started out not getting past like, 64 or something. Now I can do almost 300! This game is VERY FUN, COMPETITIVE, AND ADDICTIVE, LOVE ITT!!! Just please work on the fact that we can't share our scores and be ranked with the rest of the world!!!!!!!
A14FPG5XSB473X B007JPG04E 4 1332028800 25 reminds of soldier of fortune. I just hate you have to buy glue coins and money to get somewhere or to make the game easier.
A14FPG5XSB473X B0064B3MG8 5 1327190400 32 lwell you can compare it to castlevania the old castlevania but it only looks like it not much else in comparison with that said this game is great in its own way
A14FPG5XSB473X B0094J0J18 5 1366761600 21 games great i'ma having so much fun now wtf I get for writing this crap. darnit I have to type more

A14FPG5XSB473X B006OC2ANS 5 1330473600 21 very nice setup freezes some but I can still restart and its fine so get by that and Its a 7/10
A14FRLNI3QMEHJ B008K6HN8I 5 1366329600 32 This file explorer is really easy to use.  Navigation is simple.  What more can you ask for?  If you need to see files in your Kindle, this is a great little app.
A14FRLNI3QMEHJ B00HFTHXMC 5 1389916800 26 I like this game because it is challenging but not so difficult that it is frustrating.  Give it a try.  The price (free) is certainly right.
A14FT4O5UKN7JL B009HKL4B8 4 1386547200 32 I have ben playing. this game a lot lately and I love it but its a litel well I 'm just saint do not do woohoo! but uther then that good app

A14FTED4U21YGH B008GWPEQ4 5 1342483200 22 I like this game a lot because you can name your team and buy better players to watch your team grow better.
A14FTED4U21YGH B00885RFRK 3 1338940800 20 The Kindle version of this game is not as fun as the apple version. over all, this game is fun!
A14FTED4U21YGH B00992CF6W 4 1347667200 20 finally Amazon has got a game where you can be creativ e. This game is out of these world fun.
A14FTED4U21YGH B0066T8JRK 1 1350777600 19 this game is so messed up. Worst game on kindle fire.the game creaters could have done better. Come on.
A14FXMJ2SV2UW3 B008Y0SERE 1 1394582400 29 I think that the game gets boring after a while but that's just me. If you like long games you would probably enjoy this. It's just not for me.#OK
A14FXMJ2SV2UW3 B00I8M64QG 1 1393804800 25 Flappy fish? It sucks. SO hard to control and such a horrible copy of flappy bird. If you are looking for flappy bird keep searching.
A14FZY0UZ7R1HQ B005HSL626 4 1392163200 20 i like this game it keeps me on my toes it helps me with my hand and arm movement also
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00CTMF4E4 1 1370044800 20 when it does work its really slow and I do one thing and it freezes up and closes the game
A14G3YRSAGODFX B009HKL4B8 1 1379462400 33 Well it looked fun I have kindle fire HD and it made it freeze up and I never even got to play it vurtual families 2 is much better and there's no glitching
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00IINPXLW 4 1399248000 26 This game is a good followup to the first cut the rope and is fun for everyone and has good challenges and more on nom friends!
A14G3YRSAGODFX B009HQ9UHC 4 1384387200 45 I love this game it's really fun and to me it's better than angry birds you build contraptions and in some levels birds even shoot at you! In my opinion it's worth a dollar even though it's free I would pay a dollar for it.
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00DZYXTRY 1 1377388800 25 tried to get it for my kindle and I paid for it and when I try to play it it says I don't have it
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00992CF6W 3 1371600000 40 Well it's a cool game at first but it gets a little boring I mean graphics are terrible survivalcraft is just like real life unlike this and survivalcraft is way cheeper for only $3.99 instead of $6.99 get it instead
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00B49Z8TY 4 1386460800 30 Really good app this let's you experience the fashion designer world (ps I run a business that is going to be a web site coming fall 2014) and the expenses
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00I8Q77Y0 4 1401580800 20 Pretty fun except for the fact that flappy Bird poops every time he goes through three tubes and its gross
A14G3YRSAGODFX B005ZXWMUS 4 1384560000 31 I love this app but it freezes sometimes and sometimes when you turn it on there's sound and no picture. If It didn't do that I would give it five stars
A14G3YRSAGODFX B00AAX68HG 4 1378512000 21 Pretty fun, challenging, time spender it's the fourth favorite game I've played it is really really fun you should get it
A14G649XXU8U4Z B008UXIDYE 5 1381968000 20 Very handy and decent app to have on my kindle. I use it at nights before going to bed. Super.
A14G649XXU8U4Z B00CHSPB8Y 1 1381968000 24 I tried installing it several times, and each time it failed or showed an error message. I am not sure what the problem is.
A14G649XXU8U4Z B00DJFIMW6 2 1381968000 24 I didn;t find this game interesting in the least...I guess this one should have a age limit for instance 2 - 5 year olds.
A14G654AM0VWYZ B0080K98U0 5 1357689600 22 Fun game, no problems so far. I enjoy it. Provides fun gameplay and epic graphics! The controls are not difficult at all!
A14G654AM0VWYZ B007BFSYMS 4 1359331200 30 It helps me sleep. Very good. I use it every night. I like some of the sounds. Goodnight. I had no choice but to write this reciew at 3:23 am.

A14G693RH85EBZ B005AJ6ISO 5 1345680000 26 I read almost everyday because it notifys you which is nice,  and standard and mordern translations help me understand the Bible more. God Bless you all
A14G693RH85EBZ B00A4KVFLY 2 1354838400 38 I must have hit the letter a for 6 seconds before getting it to go in as a response and the questions and answers are terribleExample : What things might you swallow?One of the answers was Pasta Really??!!

A14GENO05TABH2 B00FT8FRO2 3 1382572800 50 It was all going so well until I let my little brother create a file. It keeps freezing and crashing before I can even press play! Very frustrating. I think this game is great but this problem needs to be fixed! Wish I could give this more than three stars.
A14GENO05TABH2 B007VT07QU 4 1372896000 64 This game is so much fun! I was kind of sad to find out it was only a demo...so I wanted to buy the full version and no matter what I did it kept telling me there was an error and would not let me purchase the game! Very aggravating and I hope there is a solution. Other than this I love this game!
A14GENO05TABH2 B00A4O6NMG 5 1378339200 50 I downloaded this game in March and still playing! I'm just not very good at earning coins! Upgrading my castle on air island is so difficult because it costs so much. T-T Plus diamonds are slow coming as well. I wish it was easier. Oh well! Still lots of fun!
A14GHTNYX8IKWE B00C25OI36 4 1403913600 20 Love to cook at home.  Reading all the amazing combinations of ingredients and prep .methods is really interesting to me.
A14GHTNYX8IKWE B006CTJCWK 4 1400371200 23 I'm at the age I'm getting diseases and injuries more frequently, these body models really help me understand where and why it's happening.
A14GHTNYX8IKWE B00AF0IKRK 2 1403913600 15 Not especially suitable for me, although it has many many good deals around the city.
A14GILYCJGM6G6 B0054JZC6E 5 1331424000 37 this game is like the best game ever. especially. the slide puzzle on the 3rd slide.I also like the gold rush game it it the best. I can't wait till I get money to by more games

A14GJ2OZR770FW B00B7PKAKC 5 1362009600 27 It was really fun to play I think if your board you should play it. I give it a five that is how much I like it.
A14GJ2OZR770FW B0054JZC6E 5 1328918400 22 I like this app because its fun and it haves lots of.fun other games too. I think you should get this app.
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392336000 24 This app is good but I wish they didn't have to recreate it. Very similar to flappy Bird. I hope you love it :)
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00CRLSN4U 5 1400630400 25 I have fun with this app. It is good to do if you are bored. Another good thing about this app is anyone can play.
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00DHQHQCE 5 1377043200 21 This game is awesome! It is a lot like clash of clans. I really like it. Build homes and have fun.
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00G5LQ5MU 3 1384300800 25 This app is ok.........but you need to purchase hints......puzzles are good and challenging. Love playing this..................good for kids and adults. How you enjoy this app.......:)
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B009S980KG 5 1355788800 30 The game is awesome. You get your own airport! The game is free too!Basically,you build part of an airport,and you buy an airplane,for your airport!I would definitely recommend this app.
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00BFWY2KG 4 1360886400 24 My friend downloaded this app  a few months ago. I love this app except for the fact there are not a lot of episodes.
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00BNH1PF8 5 1363824000 37 For this game...well......um......you get to use your brain!!!!!!This game lets you look at 4 pictures, then you have to guess what all of them mean.It is a very cool app, and I think anyone would like it!!

A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B008J1ZVRY 5 1355788800 57 Temple Run Brave is really interesting. It's temple run but Meridauh is the runner. And it's a whole different background. The Prince Bear is chasing you instead of the bird monkeys. The game  is 99&cent;,but is worth every penny of it.I would recommend this app so please buy it.Thank you and it is near Christmas so,Merry Christmas!
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B006OBWGHO 1 1356307200 64 This app is so confusing.I don't even know what to do on this app.I just got this app,but I don't  even know how to start the game.I literally pressed every button.If you want a good free app.............get a different one!!!!!!!!!!!I would not recommend this app.P.S.,don't listen to the few good reviews................and listen to me and the other,2,000 something other 1 or 2 star reviews.
A14GKBJ98S2ZEL B00D1A1F50 3 1384387200 24 This app is ok....but so difficult hard to understand..........by the way take off my skin I won't cry...but you will what am I ........onion

A14GLK4SQE9WFI B00DEVQ0LA 5 1376352000 51 I rarely leave reviews but I'm so pleased that the game was changed so kindle fire 1st gen. can get this!I just loved Where's my Water and was thrilled when this came out, only to be very disappointed that we, kindle fire 1st gen. were left out from buying it.Thanks guys!!!
A14GLK4SQE9WFI B00E5GJ7QS 5 1388275200 22 Great to pass the time and you don't have to spend money unless u really want to. You get free coins everyday.
A14GLK4SQE9WFI B00E5MN3DU 5 1378944000 74 I don't usually rate games but this one was perfect for me. Had the hint button and if I just could'nt figure out the mini puzzle the skip button was there. Game goes at a nice pace and I didn't have to go back and forth 12 to 15 times carting a load of things that I didn't know where they went.Graphics are great and background music is neat. Can't wait for next one!
A14GLK4SQE9WFI B009DCOU9S 5 1375920000 43 I got a bit tired of the Big Fish games,  they all seemed too much alike,  just diff stories. This was a pleasant storyline,  graphics a 4 out of 5 and the games were fun,  not all that running back and forth either!
A14GLK4SQE9WFI B00ENTEP32 3 1380585600 138 Game had great storyline,  but all the glitches .....come on.  I constanly had little black and white boxes flickering all throughout the game. During the HO scenes the words would flicker on and off. The most sad thing was that I could see where the artwork was drawn into the scene&hellip;like a pencil drawing but it wasn't finished. and added into the scene. It was as if the game was quickly made and put out without being fully finished.  I will say that in the bonus chapter there was none of these issues.When I spend my money for a game I would at least like it to look like the art was finished for good game play. If you want to get the game I would suggest waiting until they fix the issues as it is quite distracting.
A14GLK4SQE9WFI B008Y212PI 5 1380585600 65 This was my first time trying this type of game and after going over the tutorial about 5 times and getting the hang of it I have to say I love the game.  A great way to pass the time and it makes you think. Don't like the fact that to get the &quot;bonus&quot; I either have to go to facebook or post a review.
A14GR94AID4WWF B004MC8CA2 5 1393027200 21 I am reading the bible thru in one year and love this.  Audio is exeptional.  Would recommend this to my friends.
A14GRLYFYK0NSU B007TNS6JI 5 1361318400 20 most awesome game ive ever played and its just a little hard to me but other than that great game

A14GRLYFYK0NSU B00AF6MF9I 5 1358899200 21 Awesome I love it. I think think its really cool ive been looking for a game like this for a while
A14GUKOQAGD9MU B0094BB4TW 2 1375488000 108 I have been using this app since I got my Kindle.  It was fine.  I had most of the functionally of my lap top.  The ads are not intrusive.  Perfect. Then suddenly I can't post to friends walls, the pages aren't rendering properly, click thrus lock the pages and I can't back up.  I switched to mobile view &amp; the icons for notifications, etc., are IN the middle of posts.  I've deleted &amp; reinstalled the app and no change.  Now every time I access it asks if I want to buy the full version.  Frankly, I don't trust it.  Fix the problems, please, and I'll think about it.
A14GUKOQAGD9MU B00AZZGOWI 5 1364947200 23 Downloaded on a lark and I'm hooked!  Silly and fun and very easy to play, build and level up.  Great for all ages.
A14GUKOQAGD9MU B00ABGEFWC 4 1365120000 20 Fun to play, great way to fill up dead time.  Kids (especially little girls) will love it.  Engaging critter &quot;family.&quot;
A14GUKOQAGD9MU B004VA3X7M 4 1369526400 77 I was SO excited to see the Zappos app and quickly added it to my Kindle and placed an order. However,  I am very disappointed that it doesn't have all the same functionality as the website especially with regard to payment options.  They say it recognizes my VIP status but how can I tell?  Plus all my payment options are linked to that account.  Why can't I use those?  Like I said, the app is great, but...
A14GY3R7JEH5GB B006RIQIFK 1 1353715200 37 I got this expecting a Full version however it is asking for me to upgrade. Aside from that the game is a very basic version of Mahjong, super simplistic. Stay away from this bait and switch scam.
A14GY3R7JEH5GB B004GBARY8 1 1319414400 21 Why on earth does a wallpaper need access to my phone state and identity?.. my opinion is definately DO NOT INSTALL.
A14H399WR4YLGS B004YF1LLY 5 1378339200 30 I love QVC.  I watch it all the time on TV.  And now I can watch it on my Kindle Fire.  In fact, I bought the Kindle Fire from QVC.

A14H6KU3TBVWGF B00H343YNQ 5 1396915200 24 This Is the number one slot machine.  You have a lot of slots to choose from and you get free bonus money every hour.
A14H6KU3TBVWGF B00FSCBNRE 5 1396915200 38 I run out of money too fast, but I love the slots.  You do get bonus money every hour, however, after playing one session I am out of money.  It takes me 12hrs to build it up again.

A14H7WKOCGD7B6 B00FX6ZBXC 5 1383350400 43 This game plays just fine on my kindle fire and is fun to play. I've never been a Scrabble player so I find many of the acceptable words quite obscure, but since there's a dictionary my vocabulary is increasing,which is always a plus.
A14H7WKOCGD7B6 B006OOHYIC 5 1376179200 36 If you are looking for a thought-provoking, addictive, puzzle solving game you should try the Quell series. Planning ahead is the only way to get ahead and, to top it off, the background music is pleasing.
A14H7WKOCGD7B6 B00E8KLWB4 4 1405123200 36 The hidden object game The Secret Society is quite unique. There is a large variety of places to explore as well as challenges, mini games and a mysterious plot : ). I'm entertained,you may be too.
A14H7WKOCGD7B6 B00EBE8MUG 3 1382659200 37 I began playing tv show quiz just a few minutes ago. If I rate it I get rewarded points. Unfortunately that prompt occurred before I could form an honest opinion, but so far the game is ok.
A14H7WKOCGD7B6 B00JV858HM 5 1404000000 20 A quiet way to pass time while building your vocabulary, thinking outside of the box and gaining some more knowledge.
A14H7WKOCGD7B6 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383609600 56 Well I must admit this is possibly the best match 3 game I've played. The graphics and animation are adorable. It's challenging and, yes, addictive, which is why I appreciate the requirement to wait for lives since I actually must get things done..Oh and I haven't spent any money or connected to Facebook. Good sweet fun.
A14HA9OIIEKN18 B007TBAQCK 5 1388707200 31 Maintains is a great way to spend some of your time. If you like going to the casino  then you will like this. Great casino action. I'm glad I downloaded this.
A14HA9OIIEKN18 B006M4F67A 5 1356998400 30 I love to play mounting its a real challenge it keeps your brain sharp. it can be frustrating but it is a good challenge game. and it's a good price.

A14HHD660RTCD9 B00AO2P3GA 1 1368403200 109 the game says under product info it only takes a few Mb to install, but if you read the paragraph, who actual does, it says after you pay you need almost 2 Gb. kindle fire doesn't even hold that much space, they don't tell you ''hey, we're gonna overcharge you and we're not gonna mention that it doesn't work on the kindle fire.'' its an absolute waste, its too big for the best selling tablet. its ridiculous. all I want is my money back, it doesn't seem like a bad game its just the only game you can have. I'm not deleting everything for one game. its a ripoff.
A14HHD660RTCD9 B006OC2ANS 5 1339113600 51 Great game. best swiping fight game ever. gladiators in a coliseum fighting is a great concept for a game. the only bad thing is that the game lacks blood. the game sometimes lags but it is so worth it. its addicting with tons of equipment to buy. best free game ever
A14HHD660RTCD9 B0064XT03U 5 1342828800 39 this game is great. great controls smooth driving. the game is amazing. the game has over like 30 different cars and upgrades. the cars are cool looking and you can change the colors. You should definately get this game.
A14HHD660RTCD9 B0086700CM 5 1339718400 27 addicting fun has objectives so you don't get bored and you can play as many different characters.HOW DO YOU RESSURECT TWICE?  WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME THANKS
A14HHD660RTCD9 B0067VKQLE 5 1356998400 32 this game is very similar to the actual plants vs zombies. the plants and zombies are the same as the actual game. overall this game is great and you should buy it.
A14HHD660RTCD9 B008KMAJQU 5 1349308800 31 This game is epic. This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is online multiplayer and offline singleplayer. This game is very similar to Dead Ops Arcade.
A14HHD660RTCD9 B0087DXGIU 5 1339113600 58 this game is great. it is unlike any other game. its a sideways castle defense game but instead of you somoning allies to fight you use different types of arrows. the game has many upgrades so you wont get bored. this is a unique game that is FREE so there is no harm if you don't like it
A14HHD660RTCD9 B00ET56Y48 5 1378080000 47 This game is absolutely amazing. This game is better than the PC version (mainly because its a mobile version). This game is free so if you don't like it you can just get rid of it. You won't have to return it because its a great game.
A14HHD660RTCD9 B007Z4AKQI 5 1362096000 31 good graphics and challenging. many level/missions to keep you busy. the game is free which is a big plus. what's the harm. get it its free and you might as well
A14HHD660RTCD9 B008J1ZVRY 1 1342828800 51 why would anyone get this game. its the same thing as normal Temple Run. the only difference is that it costs more. Temple Run is FREE. why pay for something that you could get for free.  plus Temple Run is one of the best games out there. DONT GET THIS GAME!!!
A14HHD660RTCD9 B009LGKCS4 5 1369872000 31 this is a great game to pass the time. its challenging so u wont get bored. its long. there's like 250 levels. each one harder than the next. its a great.
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B008PUK8H2 4 1371859200 29 I like all Mahjong's, as you know, I have a lot of them already, this game is just a little bit different to do, but I still like it
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B006M4F67A 5 1370390400 26 Same as all the rest of stuff I said about the Mahjong games that I just reviewed, should really put the same gamesin on lump sum
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B0063M22QO 4 1372982400 37 Just like all the other Mahjong puzzle that I have, they are a good thinking game, whenit is timed, you really have be alert to what you do, so you get a good score to move on
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B007BH7T90 4 1372982400 24 Like this game, makes you think to get it done, but then I like all these mahjong puzzles, I havethem on all my devices
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B008NX8OCM 4 1374451200 48 I like this game also, I have a lot of Mahjong games.  This game keeps you on your toes and makes you think when you areplaying it.  Most people will like this game, its fun, but also makes you think when playing and that's good for your brain
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B004K4RY9M 5 1372032000 51 I like this game, I have done a lot of these before and these are goodfor a brain training session. You have to work fast (since you are times)and thatcan be hard to do, but it is a lot of fun to do. Everyone should have this game, itsa challenging game
A14HKOP0C6IOP3 B0053R08CU 3 1372032000 63 I really like doing puzzles, I have one going right now and when I'm done with theone I'm doing, I will start another.  This one is okay, but I would ratherhave the actual puzzle pieces instead of moving the pictures around to get thepicture in the right place. On the cover of this game shows puzzle pieces, so thisgame is kind of deceiving
A14HLXYXSDAON9 B00ATDOVNK 4 1375315200 36 Hidden object game for the family to play. Lots of fen for all. Hints make it easier when your  stuck.  I gave it a 4 only because I have so many that are longer. Great game!
A14HLXYXSDAON9 B0055DL1G4 5 1360886400 22 Love getting news and other current events on my Kindle. It is really cool to get this via wifi... anywhere you are...
A14HLXYXSDAON9 B007FJFDXS 4 1360886400 28 this game is fun but unless your better than I am, it is hard to flip them around... maybe smaller and YOUNGER fingers can manage this more easily.
A14HLXYXSDAON9 B0064X7FVE 5 1360886400 33 It's always nice to know what the weather is doing when your planning of going somewhere. It can change in the blink of an eye around here so, Nice to get the info.
A14HLXYXSDAON9 B004K4RY9M 5 1360972800 23 this is a very fun game. passes the time and also good for the mind. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys games.
A14HMMI06CJUX9 B0087HEQ6M 5 1339027200 24 so far it reminds me of lil' kingdom (which I LOVE) except it goes horizontal  instead of vertical.  keep.up the good work GLU MOBILE
A14HMMI06CJUX9 B008MM9630 5 1356566400 22 nice way to spend a snowy day cuddled on the couch.  no problems with the app.  don't have to buy extra things.

A14HMMI06CJUX9 B009NTJRQM 4 1351641600 21 takes awhile to finish quest but it is an alright game.  wish it had bigger payout for the candy - 4stars
A14HMMI06CJUX9 B004VCZW60 5 1332115200 20 has room for everything, great way to keep track of the premenopausal woes, you can't go wrong with this app

A14HMMI06CJUX9 B007NACZPI 5 1332460800 22 A new twist on a game.  No problems with the kindle fire,  good clean fun.  You can still play without buying crystals.
A14HMMI06CJUX9 B008B84O6Y 5 1340928000 21 I like having the quest to do.  Haven't had any technical problems with this game.  So far its a great game.
A14HMMI06CJUX9 B0085N9I84 5 1339632000 20 I love quest driven games that give you something to do.  This is in my favorites on my Kindle Fire.
A14HMMI06CJUX9 B008B88LEU 5 1342656000 20 can't stop playing.  love this game.  well worth the extra $4 for unlimited turns.  I could play this game forever
A14HMUO82F87UP B008IBIJTM 1 1368403200 25 I didn't even set the timer and it wont let me search or watch any vidios simple as that dont wast your time geting it
A14HMUO82F87UP B008OOYALE 3 1360368000 27 Every time i try to move something it always goes to a light blue screen and your lucky I don't delete it other than that its perfect
A14HMUO82F87UP B00846GKTW 1 1359158400 33 Okay here's the deal I'm on the last character on pro styles and every time I pick bakini it changes to tankini and it gets annoying so other than that I like it
A14HN2XM74OHPQ B00BS3UFCQ 4 1369612800 24 Enjoyable game.  This You learn a lot and it jars your memory and makes you think. This is a great game for movie buffs.
A14HN2XM74OHPQ B00DLJ31HQ 4 1373068800 21 This is a very fun and entertaining game. A great pass time on a Rainey day.  Lots of beautiful pictures too.Tan2mccoy

A14HNX5POL9NB2 B007TO3JW6 5 1337731200 26 Having a great time live it.  So much fun.  Never played slots before now I know why people love them so much. Could be come addicting.

A14HNX5POL9NB2 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383091200 32 So addicted to this game!!!  Love it have told all my friends that have a Kindle they can now play it on their Kindle and a couple are already hooked on it.
A14HNX5POL9NB2 B0080H2TFE 4 1383091200 23 You have to think while playing this game.  I enjoy it.  Be prepared to be come addicted to getting to the next level.
A14HOS9NPSO079 B00CEBKMN8 5 1393200000 21 I officially have an addiction to this game one of my favorites this week can't ever put it down. Great game.
A14HSAL85020IN B0063GORYU 5 1325894400 24 I love this game. I've played it for years and I never tire of it. So glad I can play on my kindle fire!!
A14HSAL85020IN B007SYWFRM 4 1335052800 21 kinda like a farmville. kids would really like it. graphics are well done. neat to play and just pass some time.
A14HSAL85020IN B00846F1YW 4 1361059200 75 it's a fun hidden objects game. the dialogue is a little holey but there is an option for turning it off. you do not have to post to facebook or twitter. there is an X to close that box. sometimes to see parts of the picture covered by graphics of the game you will need to zoom in.I don't know that I would pay 2.99 for it, but I do think it's a fun game.
A14HSCJ4K4XNBF B00FAX6XQC 2 1387065600 29 I bought coins in the game and they never showed up.  I tried to report the problem but links keep taking me places that won't help me.  Please fix.
A14HSCJ4K4XNBF B00A4034W2 5 1391385600 28 Had this on my android phone.  So glad they brought it to Kindle. I could play it all day.  Ash's comment straight from the movie crack me up!
A14HUUHAC9PRFE B00AA87JGU 3 1384560000 27 great game love playing in spare time takes your mind and makes it think. some levels can be difficult and takes a little time to figure out
A14HUUHAC9PRFE B00JE7XQI8 5 1399593600 27 great game. I love it. some levels can be tricky but figure out after a little while. just wish it would update so more levels would open.
A14HUUHAC9PRFE B007MNV5WU 3 1343433600 32 I love the game but where are the updates. my son has gotten his for the phone so why cant I get updates for the kindle fire. I give this a 3
A14HVLAMA922RI B0087HT36U 5 1351468800 28 very entertaining... fun levels. my son and myself play levels over and over. wish there were more levels though but still overall a great game.... keep it up
A14HVLAMA922RI B00CB4ET0K 5 1379289600 30 This is a great game. Cannot believe it is free. Love the fact that you can earn free credits as well.... must have game for anyone e who likes shooters...
A14HVLAMA922RI B00BBMQXLG 5 1389571200 24 My title pretty much sums it up. Fun game, great graphics.... huge huge huge huge fan of this game keep up the good work....
A14HYQQAOPIQOV B00FPH8L40 5 1388707200 22 These games are very challenging. I have been enjoying playing them with the whole family.  Just a few I wasn't sure of.
A14HZ7ID6PZPUH B00AZPAI6Q 4 1364083200 22 I love this game but having trouble loading on my kindle fire ...please fix this and then it will be PERFECT! Ki
A14HZ7ID6PZPUH B0080H2TFE 5 1378944000 28 LOVE THIS GAME. Very addicting and I usually hats numbers.... the only thing is that you hafta get from 20 to level 50 in one shot.... too long.
A14HZ7ID6PZPUH B00EBQRSTK 4 1378944000 21 Fun game.... makes you think.  not too difficult. as to  drive you crazy... I recomend this game.would be great for kids!
A14HZ7ID6PZPUH B007MPJQ38 5 1336953600 25 This game is way worth the money!  Not too hard and not too easy.... Relaxing and fun. Not agrivating .... Works well on Kindle Fire....
A14HZ7ID6PZPUH B008AZGWYK 2 1343865600 26 I thought this ap would help me keep track of my medicine interactions...but does not... I thought it would be less complicated but it is not....
A14I0LYQI5GBV5 B00B2TET3C 5 1364688000 22 I think the cards should be free. I don't think it's right that we have to buy bingo chips to play cards...
A14I0LYQI5GBV5 B008Y212PI 4 1380585600 41 This game is very addicting. I say down and played the whole game....had to do a few over a few times. But hey it kept me busy when I was home alone.I would recommend this game to kids who are bored
A14I0LYQI5GBV5 B00AZPAI6Q 5 1364256000 25 This game is so addicting and fun... I like how I can play with people from around the world...it's a very very fun game :)
A14I0LYQI5GBV5 B00E5GJ7QS 5 1376784000 22 This game keeps me busy on my day odds when I have nothing else to do. They should totally make another one.
A14I1F2J25LR8M B007KOKIK6 4 1359244800 24 Got it for my 5 year old twin grandkids when they stayed with us. Good way to keep them entertained. I would download again.
A14I1F2J25LR8M B00881VLCE 5 1396569600 37 I definitely like this puzzle app.  I like that you can change the color of the background. Nice puzzles and you don't need a lot of space. Magic Puzzle is a must for any jigsaw puzzle enthusiast.
A14I1JG9YMODCE B00JJNT3MK 4 1400025600 39 Would have given this game a five star, but the sound is horrible and starts to get irritating fading in and out.  Otherwise, great graphics, story and HO and puzzles.  Please hurry and get a patch for the sound.
A14I1JG9YMODCE B008O661PK 5 1358121600 44 Fantastic. Great story, graphics and motion.  Hidden object games are good (needs zoom) and mini puzzles are fun.  Worked well on Kindle Fire HD 8.9.  Hurry with more HO games like this.  Unlimited hint button kept the game fun without getting frustrating.  Thumbs up.
A14I1JG9YMODCE B009AY04A8 1 1377388800 22 Thankfully this was free.  No zoom, way to much dialogue, boring.  Probably more geared to the younger players.  Anyway keep your money.
A14I1JG9YMODCE B00I5WL0HW 4 1402963200 75 The color and scenery are quite nice and the story is good.  Lots of little cut scenes which I enjoy and sound dialogue.  The hidden objects are not all just the standard seek and find, but involve finding objects and then using them to find the next object.  I have not had any problems with the running of the game, but it takes time to load in between scene movement.  It is worth the $2.99.
A14I1JG9YMODCE B00D99XZCY 3 1376352000 38 The game was okay, but very, very short. The price should be $.99.  Not overly exciting, pretty easy......if you haven't tried Empress of the Deep 1 & 2, they are a much better value and way more fun.
A14IAMEPAD00XL B006J2EG6M 4 1390348800 22 This game is so much fun, I play for hours! I love word games anyway and this is one of my favorites!
A14IAMEPAD00XL B00FAPF5U0 5 1390608000 30 I am so addicted to this game! I love that I can help my Facebook friends and have them help me! So glad I can play on my Kindle now!!!
A14ID8U4R4V4MC B004H6WTJI 5 1326844800 148 I love this app because it helps me lose weight.  It helps me keep tabs on what I eat so that I begin to understand the calories and how my activity level impacts on it. I only use it when I'm determined to lose weight and when I lose it (or don't), I stop. The first time, I lost about 8 lbs after using it for 2 months.  Then, I stopped using it and I go back for a month or so, whenever I want to lose weight.  My weight loss has leveled off since then and I can't make huge losses again.  However, this was very useful especially if you are a huge foodie like I am.  I like eating a mixed bag of international food and you can find the most obscure food on there too and portion out how much of it you actually ate.
A14ID8U4R4V4MC B00F8L2VO4 5 1395532800 757 Over 20 years ago, I lived in Italy for 4 years (not consecutive) and had several group lessons but despite the efforts of my various instructors, I just didn't have the patience to learn the grammar.  My knowledge of vocabulary was good enough for me to communicate and function but I never could get the hang of conjugating verbs, learning about the articles, and spelling words properly.  Later lived in Latin America for 4 years and that messed up my language skills big time!  So, now I speak both languages very poorly - just throwing out words to make a mishmash sentence.  A couple years ago I went back to Italy and they asked me if I could speak english because they couldn't tell if I spoke Spanish, Italian or some unknown language!  (Note: My native language is American English)So, I'm returning to Italy again for a 2 week vacation and I'm determined to be better this time and not embarrass myself.  So, I got Duolingo on Feb 20th and believe it or not, I'm truly addicted to the program!  I have a full time job and when I come home I'm tired and yet, every single day, I spend 1 hour to 2 hours working on these mini lessons from Duolingo!  Funny, they are kind of addictive.  They force you to learn the language by making you hear the language, speak the language, interpret the phrase back and forth between languages, to spell it properly, and put it in the correct order.  If you do it wrong more than 3x then, it kicks you out of the lesson and makes you start over, but the lesson is different the next time around.  Now, you would think one would get discouraged, I mean, I've had to redo some lessons about 6x, and yet, somehow, the way it is structured, it makes me want to keep at it and do it right!  I mean it is working on me, one of the most stubborn learners!So there are a multitude of topics at every level (beginning/intermediate/advanced) and within each topic they have 4-8 different minilessons in each topic.  It visually has a graph that shows you where you are at.  And, even when you think you are done with a topic (whew), every couple of days, that topic reopens and they make you practice it again so you don't forget!  Wow!  So, even with my background knowledge/vocabulary of Italian, I'm still at the very end of the beginners (Level 8; 335 words!) and I've been working hard for a month!  Oh, another downer is I was working on it for 12 days and suddenly it reset and told me I was back on day 1.  I thought it did that every 12 days but now it says I'm at 16 days. (IF ANYONE READS THIS FROM DUOLINGO; I WANT IT RESET TO FEB 20TH THAT I'VE DONE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY!).The downside is that if you have never ever studied a latin language this would be super hard for you.  I think if you already know a similar language like spanish and how it is structured, it will be easier for you.  However, if you are a person who has never studied a romance language and absolute beginner that only knows Ciao, etc..and hever had a lesson, then, you will have a hard time.  Also, if you are a miserable speller in your native language, learning to spell Italian will kill you because it is so difficult to get all of the vowels in the right place.  I have many times translated a very complicated sentence from english to Italian, only to get it counted wrong cuz I misspelled 1 letter!  But, it forces me to really think what I'm writing and how it all comes together to form a complete sentence.  Also, it really doesn't teach you the vocabulary or the grammar rules, at all.  I kept failing the lesson because I wasn't sure what some articles meant because they seem to mean different things at different times.  Yesterday, I finally broke down and got a grammar book so I can look up what all of the articles mean.  So, this program works for people who are already familiar.  I'm worried that when I get in the more immediate level, I might need to study before using this as it isn't really a good teacher - doesn't explain or introduce new concepts.  Good for people that really want to tighten up what they already know and go farther.
A14ID8U4R4V4MC B004UBH4S6 2 1326844800 49 thought that this was a fun app at first until for many consecutive days I got the absolutely worse horoscopes ever, everyday! it was really bringing me down, almost abusive, and messying with my head where I felt there was no hope for better days so I deleted it!
A14ID8U4R4V4MC B0050KDTSK 2 1359331200 98 I like all of the team lava apps such as Pet Shop, Fashion Story, and Restaurant Story.  However, this Farm one seems to be even more limited whereby I can't go far up the levels without shelling out real money.  I refuse to shell out real money for pretend stuff!  So, I don't recommend it.  Also, I have bought with points several buildings - only to find out, that I had to build it!  There was no icon that indicated it had to be built to warn you, like their other apps.  Rip off - I sold them!
A14IGZ8RZAGYJE B009HKL4B8 5 1396828800 42 I wasn't sure about this game, but it turned out to be fantastic! I thought it would cost me through in-app purchasing, but you don't need to pay to play. This game is simply the best for people who love Sims games!
A14IGZ8RZAGYJE B00FCYEZOQ 5 1384300800 24 I wasn't sure about the game at first, but i love it! It is sooo addicting. I can't stop playing it! Thank you game!
A14IGZ8RZAGYJE B00B2V66VS 5 1364774400 35 I think that Temple Run 2 is fun and a great time killer. I especially like the new update for it. I own both Temple Runs, but Temple Run 2 is better by a lot.(:
A14IGZ8RZAGYJE B007OXASB2 5 1365033600 43 When I first got the game,I thought that it would be a boring game and would cost a lot of money.Then I started to play it,and got really addicted in a great way!Now I have a large pet shop and I luv it!
A14IGZ8RZAGYJE B00D9SC4TA 5 1379030400 47 This version is by far the best! Sooooooo many more options than the others. The clothing selections are so much better. I really like this one's makeup and hair selections better too. You have got to get this game. Best one! Thanks LiBii! :) :) :) &lt;3
A14IGZ8RZAGYJE B00I8Q77Y0 3 1397606400 32 It's not amazing but it's not bad either. Over all it's so-so. It's actually more difficult than Flappy Bird. I also enjoyed it at the same time. Recommended for Flappy Bird fans.
A14IIAAPGU8XFU B005D9MUWY 4 1338422400 31 It's easy to use. I bought it and I have no regrets. I switch between English and Spanish in the same text and swiftkey recognizes and works amazingly. I recommend it.
A14IIAAPGU8XFU B004XDYJRU 4 1349654400 27 This app is very good. It has all the local stations in LA and I can still hear the stations from Europe. This is all I need!
A14IIAAPGU8XFU B005LY4B0A 5 1316304000 28 EVO 3D,  I just got the game and it looks amazing.  The graphics are very well done.  It makes you think and its based on strategy.  Super recommendable.
A14IJ05L8QRGKD B00B9FNHOG 4 1377216000 21 Tbh I love the game I really do but they need to listen to my suggestions that I gave for them
A14IKT91TWBUKJ B00785P2QC 5 1353715200 109 This is a really great game for those who like virtual games! it goes down to the smallest details in building your city, like setting your trash truck and bus routs and even delivering your factory items to the "s-mart" for people to buy and the great thing about the game, is that you still earn money when your not even in the game and when you come back nothing except the amount of money you have is diffrant. The only problem I have with the game is that to do some of the objectivs you have to have a facebook. :( other than that, I love the game!
A14IKT91TWBUKJ B0086700CM 5 1353801600 23 I think that this is a really fun game and I like the fact that you can get power ups! really great game!!!
A14IKT91TWBUKJ B008JGSM6G 4 1353801600 38 its a really fun game and a good way to relax your mind. im currently stuck on a level and i find that i keep getting stuck on levels which frustrates me somwhat. but overall. its really great!
A14IKT91TWBUKJ B005HSL626 4 1353888000 150 I got this game on the kindle because I loved the I-pad version so much and its really fun but after I got it, I quickly earned all the blades and backrounds there was nothing really else to do. I gave It  4 stars because it also kept freezing on the loading leaving the screen blank white and other times when I would just have earned a new blade or backeround you could see the outline of the &quot;new&quot;  blinking, but there was obliously a glitch . I wont sit there being grumpy and giving everyone you personel opinion about what you think of all the glitches and  bad things about the game ( Honestly, no offense.) because it is a good game and im really glad that its free but do be beware that it may come with a few mistakes. so dont say I didnt tell you so....
A14IKUEE6FCM2Z B0055DL1G4 5 1361145600 26 Very through and informative.  Lots of articles and about covers everything.  If I want to know anything that is going on it is on NBC news.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00CJ77HU8 5 1371340800 55 Lots of fun. Fire balls, lightning and explosions keep you addicted to this game. I keep telling myself this is the last level and when it's over I find myself playing yet another level. Makes a wait at the dentist office seem very short. I have a lot of jewel games, this is my favorite.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B009LFGG76 5 1396828800 49 This is a pretty good word search. I like that the highlighted words use different colors for each word. The word on the bottom of the screen cross off automatically as you find them..I downloaded it for free.. I like that there's no timer.all in all a good game.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00JBNS6KS 5 1400630400 110 I wasn't ready for how addictive this game is. I try not to start it if I know I'm going to need to do something soon. It's not the kind of game you pick up for a few minutes to pass the time in line. I play this on a long car ride, at night after the chores of the day are done, or if I'm stressed and need to get out of my own head for a while. It's easy to learn and fun to play. The small changes in each puzzle are explained in a small sentence before the new game begins. Creative, colorful, fun..it gets 5 stars.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B008IXP8IU 5 1391472000 68 If you like word games of any kind, you will love this game. It is fun, addictive and educational. You'll get a clue and how many letters your answer needs..the rest is up to you. Kind of like a crossword puzzle married to  a scramble..the results are this game. Try it. If you like words you won't be sorry. I only just downloaded it and I'm hooked already.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00ET0PZDO 4 1389398400 75 Not a very complex game. It's fun, and once you get the hang of it, it becomes addicting.  There could be a bit more &quot;How to play&quot; directions, but figuring that out is part of the first challenge. Not complicated, but just enough to keep you guessing and  makes it hard to stop playing. As with most games it gets more challenging with each level. Happy I gave it a try..now back to the game..
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B009XFDFPU 4 1362528000 29 I didn't know what to expect, but I am happy with this game. It is a bit different from other match games. A little more challenging. It becomes addicting.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B0085YOD1A 5 1370736000 48 This app works great. I like that it lets me know how many hours I have left. I know in advance if and when I need to plug in my Kindle. It's nice to have an idea of how long I have before I need to plug in.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B009C7ZQM4 5 1378252800 91 I have this on my phone &amp; my Kindle fire. It has helped me numerous times to free up some space that was needed. When my device starts to seem slow, I  let clean master do its thing and it always helps. Instead of me looking through the device one piece at a time, Clean Master scans it all and asks if you want to clean it before it gets rid of anything. I have found it very helpful. Besides that I got it for the best price...free Thanks Clean Master!
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00EGY1WN0 5 1388275200 50 This is one of the best apps for free kindle books. I have a few, but I really like the format of this one. It's organized, easy to read and the books are not what every other app has. There's something for everyone. Like browsing through your favorite book store.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B009AY04A8 4 1377388800 102 This game is fun because it changes the objective for every scene. Sometimes you have to find 12 of the same kind of object, like all the candles or all the bottles. Sometimes you have to find the object with the word for a clue, and other times with the shadow of the object as the clue. There are also times when the screen is divided in half and you have to find the differences between the two. It keeps it from getting boring. It could do without the story though, but just a tap on the text clears it quickly enough.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00AEJM6H2 5 1366416000 93 Been playing Jewels Star for a few weeks and I have to say I'm not bored or tired with it at all. I have other Jewel match games, but I always come back to this one. There are several modes of play to keep it interesting. No annoying adds popping up all the time. You don't feel like the game is going to cut you off any moment, so it's calm and fun not  frenzied. Give it a try if you like this type of game this is a good one to download.
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00GY0HJ4K 4 1391385600 53 This is relatively easy. If you just want to finish the level it's easy enough to do, if you think about stacking up your points then it can be more challenging.. That's what makes this good for everyone. You can win by doing the minimum, or think harder and add on the points..
A14ILKU9DR95Q5 B00846F1YW 4 1360886400 130 This game is addicting even though the story isn't . The story is just a means to get you from one puzzle to the next.  I like that the puzzles are not too hard, so if you are just looking to relax and have some fun with a puzzle or two or three then this will do it. I also like that each puzzle is different. Besides trying to find objects, there is also searching for the differences between a split screen, finding  10 to 20 of the same object & even  jigsaw puzzles. I'm only up to the 4th level, but I'm glad I downloaded it and I recommend it to anyone looking for a little challenge. If you're looking to strain your brain, you may want to pass.
A14IMES1CXJ74W B0066T8SDU 5 1352332800 20 This game is so much fun. You can play by yourself or you can play with friends. I am addicted!
A14IMES1CXJ74W B0063IH60K 5 1362441600 21 There are a lot of ads but they are quick and easy to navigate away from. Very fun game to play.
A14IP3H8EU0C1T B0064X7B4A 4 1389225600 21 Great app, great way to pass time. I play with my 9 year old granddaughter and my 40 year old daughter!
A14IRM2N6WQOT9 B0058VW36U 5 1309910400 44 This is the most polished translation of a high profile ios game yet (original ad supported Angry Birds sucked on even high end phones). The popcap games are fun but blurry, buggy, and clearly an afterthought. Thanks for showing us some respect! OG Evo.
A14IRM2N6WQOT9 B004UBTYHU 3 1327190400 32 Good production value, decent visuals, sounds, and controls. Still boring; hampered by the limited concept. This game would be fun IRL, but it's painfully boring compared to free offerings like Stickman Golf.
A14IRM2N6WQOT9 B004JJR2K4 5 1312070400 42 This has saved me more grief than I expected even though it seems to randomly disconnect after long periods of use. Also desperately needs Honeycomb tablet client. If you can get it working on Ubuntu, why not Android? It just makes sense.
A14IRM2N6WQOT9 B004QJGPNM 3 1301961600 29 Unlike another reviewer, I have no problem getting this to work on my Evo. It's a pretty dumb game though, in my opinion. Graphics and production value are nice.
A14IRM2N6WQOT9 B004FOA84A 4 1303776000 24 I liked this a lot. I don't consider myself an idiot (thanks, Mom!) and I found the puzzles challenging. Give me more like this.
A14IRM2N6WQOT9 B004SBS8LA 5 1300752000 59 I didn't know this was coming today, but I am soooooo excited! It's very fun so far. I find it a little disingenuous to give the game 1 star because it wouldn't install properly on your device. Give them time to iron out the kinks on the first day the market goes live, won't you? It's not Rovio's fault.
A14IUMZWQ03SGX B00FEIX5OG 5 1388188800 22 Great game. Hard to put down! Just had to share this fun fun fun game. It has kept me up at night.
A14IUMZWQ03SGX B00FJYQUD8 4 1394064000 27 It's cute and mind numbing. Just what I need at the end of the day. And you buy it once and play as much as you want
A14IUMZWQ03SGX B00IAQ3RJM 5 1402358400 22 I like something to at before bedtime and this is a good one. Helps relax the mind so sort of like meditation
A14IWMY5GIPO1Y B004DPCSKI 5 1395100800 137 I was reading a book waiting for this app to respond to me and the book was a novel called Knew it in a Moment and it said moment then the next day I thought well maybe it will respond again to the book so then I finished the book and at the end a lady died, the protagonists mom, and the app said mom, book, and deadAlso that same day I was wondering why the ghost was in my house and we bought the house from a man named Phil and I opened the app it said Phil followed by dad. Phil goes to our church and so Sunday I asked about his dad he said he moved away from that house because his dad died there and he felt too many memories of his dad
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B0063IH60K 5 1387756800 38 I've had this game since I got my Kindle Fire a year ago and I've been entertained since then. Could use some more card designs but that won't stop me from still giving it 5 out of 5.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B005ZXWMUS 5 1387756800 20 Really great app for the Kindle fire. It also works with the Google chrome cast device. Nothing bad to report.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B00CSR2J9I 3 1387756800 32 The only reason why I'm giving it 3 out of 5 is because for some reason I haven't gotten the last few updates until months later. Otherwise it's a really fun game.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B008OD6QYE 5 1387756800 25 You could spend as much time fishing on here as you do on a real boat. All his quotes before you cast are really funny.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B0060I3IJG 5 1387756800 32 I have stumble upon on my computer and my tablet and its great for surfing the web and just wasting time. It even learns as you thumbs up or thumbs down stuff.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B006C4U9RW 5 1387756800 27 I used to be a big Pandora fan until a friend recommended this app. I love that you can find songs without lyrics and for specific moods.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B00E9A656K 4 1387756800 52 You have to wait a little longer for some upgrades once you get up there in levels but it makes you want to keep playing. Some cars seem a little impossible to acquire so that's why I only gave it a 4 out of 5, otherwise it's a really fun racing game.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B00529IOXO 5 1387756800 28 If you have a device that isn't tied down by a service plan our even if you do, this app is great for sending and receiving free texts.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B00AESN8XY 5 1387756800 37 This is not just a game. A friend of mine told me scientists love this game because it helps them with research on diseases. So keep coming up with diseases people, this game helps the greater good.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B00ELOOYZI 4 1387756800 29 This game lets you test all sorts of different rockets. I wish it came with some duct tape attachments so the big rockets wouldn't fly apart at the seams.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B0069G5Z9K 5 1387756800 26 Really fun running game. All the different jetpacks are really creative and funny. I've only scratched the surface but I've had a lot of fun playing.
A14IZ4MLMVJ0TP B00F8H0LM2 4 1387756800 33 Really awesome version of angry birds. Unfortunately I'm giving it 4 out of 5 only because it's a really short game so far. Once there's more levels added I'll give it 5 stars.
A14JCP837W5T6Y B004SJ3AXI 5 1332892800 44 My grandchildren and I love to play this game. Back in the day I never had an angry birds game. Just a pencil and paper and played hangman with my best friends. I recommend this game for all you youngsters that like a challenge.
A14JCP837W5T6Y B006OCM13M 2 1353196800 55 These dang scallywags think that they can get away with these doubled prices. But I think they are downright wrong. My grandchildren played this game and they told me these prices had doubled. So Team Lava... these prices are like spoiled cabbage... AWFUL! I told my friend Ernestine, and she agreed with me. I'm ashamed.
A14JCP837W5T6Y B004SJ3BCI 4 1332892800 63 Angry Birds is a game loved by everyone. I hear people at my retirement home talking about how their grand kids play this all the time. I finally tried it and wooooeeeeee was it fun! The reason that I gave it four stars is because I don't think that everything is perfect ( except for my grandchild Mary Jane) I recommend this game.
A14JCP837W5T6Y B009PSV1HE 2 1353110400 43 My grandchildren introduced this game to me on the computer. Well, I was looking through the apps and found this. So I instantly downloaded. Well, looks like these young whippersnappers couldn't think of anything better. I am very disappointed in these young radishes.
A14JCP837W5T6Y B007MFDUP8 1 1332806400 44 If you were able to rate this 0 stars, I would. Where is draw something? Give us draw something! Plus, you barely get a chance to draw. You are always the last person to draw. So my point is, don't get this awful game.
A14JJ6OK4SRCF2 B004SBS8LA 5 1301097600 25 Excellent in tradition of the angry bird series of apps. I love it! Looking forward to the new levels when they are available. Very addictive.
A14JJ6OK4SRCF2 B0054QY36C 5 1340668800 324 First of, I am not the developer and in no way associated with the developer of this app, but I am a developer myself for other Android apps. I downloaded this app just like any other FAOTD, and happy to see a real app instead of useless games every day.I just noticed some of the reviewers are leaving bad feedback for this app because apparently its only a widget. While I think the UI of this app may use some improvement, I think it is a fine UI as an app - you do need to explore a bit to find all the features so its not super intuitive. But you do not need to use it as a widget to take advantages of it - I am not using it as a widget and I can enter all information, view charts (well you need at least data points to view a chart), set goals, calculate BMI and even BFP without ever leaving the app.Please explore the app a bit before leaving 1 star reviews - if you do not like the UI, feel free to suggest improvements to developers. Believe me or not, we developers are also human beings and we have feelings, and we are also trying to make a living by selling apps. If you don't like the app, delete it and be done with it. As for myself, I have not consented to make my app a FAOTD and never will, I think many developers like me feel this way because we do not like being trashed by freeloaders who download an app for free and think it is worthless even though they got it for free anyway. It is because of inconsiderate reviewers like you all Amazon users are suffering because there are many great apps that will NEVER be FAOTD as long as people like wtf, superman75 are not permanently banned.Just had to get that off my head.
A14JJ6OK4SRCF2 B004KAL2BC 2 1305849600 49 Here is another application that insists on keeping the background service running and starting up at boot. I can see if I have notification enabled it will be necessary but even with all notification disabled it keeps running and refuses to be killed. Sorry not impressed. Uninstall. Samsung Captivate.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B0091QSNEE 4 1399507200 46 I don't know why, but they love to play this game over and over again.  This is their first choice.  Ages 3 and 5 enjoy it very much.  Only drawback I see is the loading screen, but it doesn't seem to bother the kids too much.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B00DJFIMW6 3 1399507200 27 Grandkids 3 and 5 loved the idea of it, but I think it was too advanced for them.  Maybe when they get older we will try again.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B00EW0XSP8 1 1399507200 33 Thought this would be great for grandkids, 3 and 5.  However, token and money and all the choices too much.  I would not buy the full version and have deleted from my phone.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B00AA0TJO8 1 1399507200 20 I didn't think it would hold the kids attention, so deleted it.  I don't think I will try it again.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B004H6WTJI 4 1393891200 21 It would be perfect if I could also record my blood glucose reading on it.  Otherwise it's really great!  Good Job!!!
A14JJH13C4BNHT B00DEG4Z1W 5 1399507200 31 We have had this game for a long time and the 3 and 5 year old still enjoy it. I haven't bought the full version, but the free one works well.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B0091QS88K 1 1393891200 23 always asking you to upgrade to full version. Not impressed with it, doubt my grandchildren would like it and would want to upgrade.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B00BPWZKAM 3 1399507200 21 OK.  But, match games are a dime a dozen and the kids get bored with it. Wouldn't buy the full version.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B007SYWFRM 2 1363305600 30 Found it difficult to play and couldn't find directions in how to play it.  Also, appears that you had to be online to play.  Not what I was looking for.
A14JJH13C4BNHT B004H2MGOU 2 1363305600 36 When I downloaded it, I was thinking of my 94 year old mother.  However, it soon became apparent that whomever goes first has the best chance to win.  It just wasn't what I was looking for.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B008D29K7G 3 1364688000 27 Good way to see the top line stories. Not the best way to search the complete content. If you like Fox then you will like this app.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B00B63HT8Q 4 1374969600 24 I really like how the radar image works. The way that they present to forecast could be upgraded. This is the one I use.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B00AQ398AY 4 1363305600 25 It runs in the background and I cannot tell that it slows down my KIndle at all. I have had no problems with malware either.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B00ARI9CDQ 4 1376265600 27 The Mail is not always interesting but the app works on my Kindle without any problems. If you like this newspaper then you will like the app.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B004GWRMWC 5 1374969600 22 There is very little difference between this app and the regular website. The information is easy to use and it works quckly
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B00BTYP6QE 3 1376265600 21 If you like this type of game then you will most likely enjoy this app. It works well on my Kindle.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B0091SUMB4 3 1363305600 26 It has not caused any problems but it is hard to verify that it made a difference. Maybe I did not need it to begin with.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B0065AFQSU 5 1363305600 20 This is a quick and easy way to check the scores and headlines of your favorite teams. It customizes easily.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B0088P2A7A 5 1363305600 21 The articles are formatted for tablets and the response time is quite fast. If you like Wiki you will like this.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B009G9KFQ0 5 1364688000 26 I use it more that I thought that I would. It loads quickly and has enough page options to cover almost all of my weather questions.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B00632HWOG 4 1360195200 20 THis app works pretty well. Seems to move at a better speed than the regular web site. I do recommend.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV B004VOJT0I 4 1364688000 22 Just a few to many pre-prepared ingredients. Lots of canned soup used for ingredients. Decent results from the items helped the review.
A14JKTIUOTYS4D B007MNV5WU 5 1336435200 37 Ok, You can download Temple Run on ur kindle by going to 1moblie.com!!! First go to settings and then device to let u download other apps. Go to 1mobile.com and search temple run. works great!!!!! Enjoy!!! :)
A14JKTIUOTYS4D B004SJ3BCI 3 1325203200 35 Its a good app... but after u get further into it, it starts to maybe get... boring?? The adds r also annoying, if I were u I would get the .99 cent add free one.:-/
A14JKTIUOTYS4D B004GYY714 5 1327795200 24 AMAZING!!! I love this app its everything I was hoping for it works great for the Kindle Fire. Stop reading this and get it!!!!!!
A14JKTIUOTYS4D B004N2NWQ0 2 1325462400 57 I downloaded this app just because it was free... but if it was not, I would be very mad. It is very fun until you get to the part where you have to flip you phone/tablet, on the kindle fire it cant tell that you foiled it. If you had a different device it would be great.
A14JKTIUOTYS4D B006M4NI3E 1 1330128000 23 its really dumb... not nearly as good and got bored of it in a couple seconds. waste of time and memory. awful!!! :-(
A14JL0UJELG9I5 B00910Y1OQ 5 1352592000 40 This is similar to many Bejeweled like games out there where you shift tiles around, but it has a lot of original twists and variations that make it a fun challenge that requires thought. My favorite Bejeweled like game yet.
A14JL0UJELG9I5 B008NABUU8 5 1351036800 30 As far as bridge building games go, this is the best I've seen on my phone. instructions are clear enough and physics seem more accurate than most bridge building games.
A14JL0UJELG9I5 B00EOGZ42U 4 1388707200 28 Initially a little slow but quickly becomes challenging. I'm not sure how long the game is overall, but I've probably spent about 3 hours on it so far.
A14JL0UJELG9I5 B00B2V66VS 5 1359504000 31 I dont play a lot of runner games, but I do own a few. This is the best so far. The first temple run was also fun, but this is better.
A14JL28IGR8FRI B00ED4TX2A 5 1387238400 39 If you love zombie things like I do you will love this game. It is so addicting and when you run out of energy it will give you more but all I'm saying is that this game is awesome
A14JL28IGR8FRI B00CZY1ZV2 1 1372377600 43 Ok this looks like a great game but I got it and it did not even work the screen was just completely blank I'm not saying it's a bad game because I don't know but does anyone know why this happened to me?
A14JL28IGR8FRI B005ZXWMUS 5 1354579200 22 this is the best thing since sliced bread. all kinds of entertainment at a cheap price. try it you will love it.
A14JPFJ6PXAPDU B004GWRMWC 5 1359849600 30 I look at this app almost everyday I don't know how accurate it is have tried the contact link but no reply but good app to see what's out there
A14JPTUU5O0FXQ B008LXN9II 4 1344988800 45 this game is the perfect on the road game for kids and Adults! its fun and is better than paper version cause it wastes less paper and it offers hints. the only thing is that it can be kind of slow on the bonus game/round.
A14JPTUU5O0FXQ B00CQ9U1PW 5 1372550400 20 this game is an awesome game for when you are bored or if you need anger management or something. Enjoy
A14JPTUU5O0FXQ B00F7YHDWC 5 1382140800 26 Favorite game EVER!!!! It's super fun and all my friends love it. If u haven't played don't judge the game just download and it's really cool:)
A14JPTUU5O0FXQ B004SJ3BCI 4 1340928000 26 The game becomes addictive when you try to pass the whole story. Who knew smashing pigs with psycho birds could be fun! I highly recommend it.
A14JU2J179CMJO B006HVARCC 2 1373932800 45 I can't for the life of me understand why this app doesn't have a more intuitive interface, since I assume it's mostly geared towards children. I can't find the settings, I can't save a doodle and I can't open a fresh screen. I deleted it.
A14JU2J179CMJO B00EBE8MUG 3 1380931200 21 I've only played the first few rounds, and so far it's fun! Hopefully, there will be more variety in later rounds.
A14JU2J179CMJO B00GY0HJ4K 5 1392422400 73 The first 10 levels or so of this game are pretty easy and I thought perhaps it was intended more for children than for all ages, but as you advance in levels, the difficulty definitely increases. It's a lot of fun and a bit different from most Match 3 games, in that you connect with a line that can go up, down, or diagonally at once (rather than just one direction). Much fun!!
A14JU2J179CMJO B00BYJ6BUO 1 1368230400 26 I had high hopes for this app, but it crashed every single time I tried to open it on my Kindle Fire HD. I deleted it.
A14JU2J179CMJO B00AOA9BL0 2 1361145600 192 When I first got this app, it was great. Lots of shows available with lots of past season content. Their contracting must have changed recently with several networks as shows that formerly had full past seasons and full current seasons are now reduced to the past 3 every other episodes.Yes, you read that correctly. You don't get ANY past seasons and only every other episode for the current season, with a limit of 3 total. So you'll have episodes 1,3, & 5 and won't be able to see 2,4 & 6 to see what actually happened in between. Makes it rather useless for keeping up with new shows when you can only see half of the season and not in a logical order.Considering this app is part of a PAID cable subscription, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. Clearly they are not interested in keeping their on-the-go customers. I'll more than likely cancel my cable subscription and view shows on other PTV apps/sites and save myself some money in the long run.Way to drive away current and future consumers, Comcast! Portable viewing is the future of TV and you just shot yourselves in the foot.
A14JU2J179CMJO B0064X7FVE 1 1378166400 64 Had I written this review a couple of months ago, I would have given it 5 stars - it was compact and easy to use. However, since the last update, it's become a slow, bloated nightmare to use. &quot;Gifts?&quot; &quot;Points?&quot; It's a hot mess now. Better to go to the site and get the weather report there than try to navigate this ridiculous app.
A14JU2J179CMJO B00AEJM6H2 5 1368230400 42 If you liked a certain other &#34;jewel&#34; game, you'll enjoy this one as well. Very similar to the other game, but with an added speed bonus feature - the faster you complete a level, the higher your score. Definitely a GREAT freebie!
A14JU2J179CMJO B00A701GSS 3 1361145600 52 The title pretty much says it all. I like to browse quickly through news headlines to keep somewhat updated on current events, and will read full articles as time permits. This is geared more towards the habitual in-depth reader than a headline scanner like me. Good reporting, just doesn't fit my style.
A14JU2J179CMJO B004JOSUMI 1 1361145600 54 I've deleted this from my Kindle as it's proven to be more headache than it is worth. Long download times that are frequently stopped/paused/cancelled and SO many misnamed files, it is ridiculous. I realize that issue is out of their control, but it tells you something about the quality of offerings available. Don't bother.
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383436800 21 It's a real fun game,  enjoy playing it. Not hard to play. Good to past time. Love how colorful it is.
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B00KSOQ66K 5 1404086400 51 Just like being at a casino, the slots are just like the one's I played there. Lot's of fun,  and all the bonus game's are great. This is the first slot game that really feels like your playing at the casino.  It's so much fun. It's a real fun slot game.
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B004DLNC4I 5 1371340800 22 I live in a small town and have no problem picking up my area police and fire. very happy with this app
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B007TBAQCK 4 1340150400 50 it has the feel of the real thing. but after you go though the money they give you. you'll have to wait four hours to get more coins or you can buy more. that is why I gave it four stars insist of five. but I so love playing it.
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B0081IRIKI 5 1340496000 63 I have the kindle fire and city slots casino plays great on it. its so much fun with all the different games. the color and look is well done.  and the fact that is free is great. I like it more than some of the ones I have paid for. I go to it more as well. I must have for slot lover's.
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B007GE0X3M 5 1341619200 21 I have it on my kindle fire and it works great. has all kinds of news story's. always up to date.
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B00D6SBOWG 5 1375056000 29 Fun to play, love the graphics. Not hard to play. So relaxing. Sound quality make you feel like your at a golf course. It's a twist to solitaire .
A14JY81Z0IPGK0 B00820STKI 5 1339804800 21 my grandbables love to sit by me to play game. easy to play at any age. love the sound as well
A14K220ZQF0KU1 B00DJ075FQ 3 1391990400 142 If you enjoy Mahjong, you will like Mahjong Skies, and if you purchase it outright, you will have twelve sets of twenty games.  If you get the game for Free, you will be permitted to play only one set, The Rat.  Not bad, I suppose, for free.  But if you are not a &#34;seasoned&#34; or lucky player, you will find that having &#34;shuffles&#34; will cost you, because they must be purchased.  You are allowed three free shuffles per game.  And if you wish to play beyond the first set of twenty games, you must buy the game.  There are two other games shown on the opening screen.  These must be purchased separately, whether you have purchased Skies or not. As I have gotten other Free games and are still playing those, Mahjong Skies' attempts at draining money from me was extremely irritating.
A14K220ZQF0KU1 B00F8GYC1Y 4 1388188800 55 I am new to the whole tablet/gaming thing, so had no idea what to expect.  The game is a real hoot to play, not that I'm any good at it, but the sound effects are truly funny and the animation and scenery are terrific.  It will certainly help improve my geometric skills while entertaining me.
A14K220ZQF0KU1 B00FEIX5OG 5 1394841600 84 This is mostly a mindless game, but for those moments when that is what you need or want, this game is perfect.  It goes on and on.  It has no glitches that I have found.  The screens slowly increase in difficulty and require little to no thought at all.  Anyone can play this game, any age.  If a child is old enough to understand the purpose is to match three or more jewels for them to vanish, then they are old enough to play.
A14K220ZQF0KU1 B0064TVQ5E 5 1389139200 108 I discovered Mahjong through my Windows program.  I enjoyed it, wanted more, but could never find different patterns.  Then, I found Deluxe HD.  It is free, although you have to put up with ads.  Small price in my opinion.  The tiles are very different from those in the Windows version, but once you recognize them, the games are the same for the most part.  Speed is the object, along with clearing the screen of tiles by matching them.  I would not recommend this game on smart phones unless you have extremely good vision as the tiles would be very tiny, but on tablet/reader they are easy to see.
A14K27LP7041YZ B00DJ075FQ 5 1403913600 3 Fun as heck.
A14K27LP7041YZ B006P0A5KO 5 1403913600 2 Totally challenging.
A14K27LP7041YZ B00BMW6ER8 2 1403913600 1 Boring.
A14K27LP7041YZ B00FDUH4WY 2 1403913600 1 Okay.
A14K27LP7041YZ B009G41CG2 5 1403913600 2 Great game.
A14K27LP7041YZ B00E8KLWB4 4 1403913600 1 Awesome.
A14KH87D07B0E6 B006HUWEHY 1 1325116800 26 This game has an interesting concept but on my GS2 the float and boost controls so not function. I can only use the one fly command.
A14KH87D07B0E6 B004N8KDNY 1 1329004800 52 From the Evo 3D all the way to my GS2, nothing has matched the Polish of plants vs zombies. Popcap games has a long development cycle to make balanced, fun games. Do not waste your dollar when for a little more you could play an original idea with the polish of popcap.
A14KHBSEGHGPZP B004HM35RC 5 1327104000 27 this is very fun &amp; works on my kindle fire. This is a challenging game but I know a 6 year old mite be able 2play it.
A14KHBSEGHGPZP B004TTY694 5 1328140800 30 best evaa. you need to get this app. it works on the kindle fire perfect. It's just like the app on apple Itouches , Iphones,  and Ipads. get this app
A14KINVLU3UZ9R B00B2V66VS 5 1359331200 21 this app is an addiction so if u get it be right than get this app it is fun and awesome
A14KINVLU3UZ9R B006LPF1VG 5 1341273600 45 I love it I am a girl and it is so awesome well everyone who thinks it gross well sick it up all the 15 year Olds are Sissies who are stupid and I'm younger I'm only 10 and it is the best game ever
A14KKPF7KEDEIV B00CKW6FVE 4 1384387200 64 I loved the Old School Tetris from the 90's. This game is not exactly like the original, but I enjoy playing the game any way because it is closest to the game I love.  I don't like the way you have to purchase power ups. but you do win coins in the game.  Otherwise, its okay and I will continue to play this game.
A14KKPF7KEDEIV B006PJ3UKC 5 1378166400 103 it is beautiful and more than I expected.  The clarity of the Swarovski Crystal for me will rival any diamond.  I caught people starring at the necklace trying to figure is it real or not~  It came with a surprised gift of two dolphins with a crystal stone on silver chain which is lovely and I use for daily wear.  I would recommend this pendant to anyone.  For me, the chain could be a little longer, but I have a white gold chain that I will use depending on my mood.  For the price, a great buy and would make a lovely gift.
A14KKPF7KEDEIV B005AJ6ISO 5 1330646400 47 I love having scripture access at my fingertips. I also like having scripture notification throughout the day.  They are uplifting and right on time. Also, I am encouraged to read verses before and after the posy of the day to get a clearer understanding of the verse.
A14KKPF7KEDEIV B00BGDEK9C 4 1387584000 38 This game reminds me of actually bowling.  It has the feel and sound of a real bowling alley.  I have enjoyed playing this game and if you love bowling, I believe you will enjoy this game as well.
A14KLS6GZ47HEW B00E4WVYR8 4 1382054400 23 this game is very a mind-boggling but very educational I will love that. it's a fun game to play I'll play it again
A14KLS6GZ47HEW B00EZWPFW2 5 1382054400 59 on riddle Randalls is the best game I love playing it with my son he loves it and it gives us something to do in the morning before he goes to school I'll read it to him last time he can figure it out before I can great gamepause but  you shouldn't have to paid to play the game
A14KLS6GZ47HEW B00EBE8MUG 3 1382054400 25 have not tried this game yet but I'm sure we will try the game family fun is always great at night or during the day.
A14KOME0WQPRZE B00E3CFTJS 4 1396396800 32 I hate how long it takes and you have to spend so much coins. Hate that but other than that it's good and I hate how they don't have some worlds yet.
A14KOME0WQPRZE B00ENTDDGW 4 1398211200 26 I like this app but you should be able to go online and compete. And please stop using exclamation marks in reviews. It's annoying. So STOP
A14KOME0WQPRZE B00CRFAAYC 5 1402531200 44 It's super fun I love the challenge mode and face painting mode. But I don't have a Facebook to invite 10 friends. And I don't have the money to spend for new characters for tattoos. I love this app and I just got it
A14KOME0WQPRZE B007ZE34FM 5 1398470400 26 My friend showed to me and it's awesome. I really like it and all music is free, and you can have all the music you want
A14KP7QEWEEDQC B00CRLSN4U 3 1384387200 29 This game is really fun and tests my movie memory...lol Some of the clues are a little hard though...makes me think hard about what movie the scenes came from.
A14KP7QEWEEDQC B004MC8CA2 4 1382313600 51 I love this app because it makes it possible to always have the word with me, I just wish more features were available for offline access. I like taking notes but when I'm not in a place where I have network access, I am unable to take notes using this app.
A14KP7QEWEEDQC B00G5LQ5MU 4 1387756800 21 This game is Fun and makes you think in order to come up with the right solution. I really like it.
A14KP961F6WACJ B00DYTKKGI 5 1399593600 38 This game is The best game!  seriously, it's so fun! You could also try doctor x zombie, robot, vampire, sports team and lots of others! The best game ever and 5 star raters I love you all! :)
A14KP961F6WACJ B00CSR2J9I 5 1393891200 59 This game is great! My brother found it first, and he cracked up when the guy popped his neck. So I found it and got it! It's a good thing that it is free. I barely  have any money on my card. So, if you rated this 1 star, that's just mean. You will be sorry 1 star raters!
A14KP961F6WACJ B00F1RR3Y8 4 1394582400 38 I like this and all but I would like these things included in the next update:&middot; Some pointy nail cuts&middot; More tattoos&middot;More colorsThat's all I want and by the way, the game is The best nail game ever!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0064X7B4A 2 1352678400 40 I feel that if want make a reeeallly good app make it action packed. and of you want to make a boring app make it lame like this one. take my advice and I'm sure you'll get way better ratings.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B006OCM13M 1 1352764800 47 I feel that it's bad enough that you're making a lot of food games; but don't tell me that now you're making it out of stories. and I thought that games were supposed to be entertaining; not boring. so don't even waste your time on this junk!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0063GORYU 4 1352678400 28 It reminds me of Peter Parker from spider man. and by the looks of its cover it looks pretty cool. so I would rate it about four stars.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0069G5Z9K 5 1352678400 31 being on jet pack is actually like being on a real joyride and I love it. I guaranteed that the first time you play it you will fall in love too.!!!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B00ARIGX4M 5 1363392000 54 this game is just about one of the best burger games I have ever played. and that is why I rated it a five. I'm not gonna explain much more because if you then played the game I wouldn't need to explain it. all you need to know is that it's a good game.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0086700CM 5 1352678400 25 I can't believe I was playing this till midnight!!! I almost fell asleep with my fingers still moving as if I was still playing. o.m.g!!!!!!!#%&amp;&amp;*@!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B008GTV9DO 3 1357344000 80 it seems like every time i play this game the computer always cheats. like if i have one card left someone makes me draw two on purpose. i think it's unfair that they do this and that they let the computer do this too. so maybe you like this game but i feel that the whole cheating process is kind of annoying. and no offense but if they also didn't cheat i probaly would have rated a four or five.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B004GVYXTS 1 1352678400 47 honestly I thought it was a waste of time to even bother to download this app. I understand that the point of this game is to be challenging but do you really have to make it hard like geometry. come on now cut us a little slack.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B007JYI4SU 4 1359244800 38 once I saw this had only three stars I started to doubt this game It's is actually pretty good. it really does know my mood at the perfect moment too. and it really doesn't take that long either!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B004SJ3AXI 4 1356307200 49 this game is very fun it will give you a whole bunch of seasons t o choose from. my favorite one is the Christmas one. I find it very fun and interesting. I'm not going to lie to you it will get challenging but overall it is very fun.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B008PFPKWU 1 1363392000 40 all this game wants to do is take your money. everything ( and I mean everything) costs something. I mean what is the point in making a game if all you want is money. well I think this company sucks!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B00B2V66VS 5 1360108800 46 the person who encouraged me to play this game is my best friend and I have to say it is impressive how fun this game is. I just have to say that it is way better than temple run. 99.9% I guarantee you'll like it to!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0063IH60K 1 1352678400 21 no offense but this is a pretty slow game. why not make an action packed game.f.y.I: it's way more fun;believe me.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B009UX2YAC 5 1355529600 77 This is one of the best apps i ever had it is very fun active and a game that will keep you going the whole day. i stayed up the whole day playing this and my battery was draining down so i had to charge it plenty of times. but overall it was a very good game. and i would definitly buy it if i was you but omly for free because i only buy free games!!!!!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0093QQCGI 2 1352678400 24 all of a sudden you want to put some @#$% news on the Internet.  boy get out of here with all that. a.k.a: deuces!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B007F1SLC6 1 1356307200 56 for some reason this game doesn't interest me anymore I mean by the cover this game looks really cool but once you play it like once or twice. it sucks. honestly I really don't appreciate all of this mumbo jumbo added to this game either. I mean come on people we can do better than that!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B007TXN4TK 1 1352678400 44 honestly if I weren't hypered that day I wouldn't have wasted my quality time on this pathetic game if you want to make us into Alicia keys deliver me a real piano at my house 6:00am once again nothing but a stupid app!!!#$#*&amp;#%a.k.a: boring
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B005HSL626 4 1352678400 34 is it me or do apps like this really suck. if were gonna play freeze tag can we play it without you freezing up every 2minutes future advice:don't hate the player hate the game.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B004SJ3BCI 4 1356307200 40 challenging but still cool at the same time that's what I'm talking about a good game. there's nothing wrong with this game I don't know why anyone would rate it a 1;2;or 3. and it keeps me going all day.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0096DFBZQ 1 1352678400 24 I don't know if it's me but drifting on this game is pretty hard. If you make games easier I'll probably rate it better.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B006VXRNYG 2 1352678400 24 what I'm looking for is something proffesional. baby please this is not it. I see why it has &quot;kids&quot; in front of Doodle now@#$%*&amp;!!!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B008878MQQ 3 1352678400 35 last time I checked my grandma would play slots. or maybe instead of making old people's games we should just make regular apps. do I look like I'm in my 60's @#$$no.????!!!!!!! lets play right.!!
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B004UBH4S6 4 1357257600 65 this game will give you what kind of rhythm you might be feeling today. and the best part about it is that you get to find your zodiac sign yourself. that's what I love about this app. and you can also look up other people's zodiac sign too. but I should warn you that it's probably not an app you would want to do 24/7.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B005LIYX5Y 1 1356307200 65 I thought this game was supposed to be cooler than this.first they give you a ton of lame cars to buy from. then they say you can't get all of the cool cars. and from my opinion I don't like the way the track is set up. no offense but I don't like to look at my car faced sideways when I'm in a race.
A14KRAZYXBZ8D1 B0064X7FVE 4 1352678400 41 so far I feel that this is one of the best places to get your weather from. It's fast and easy. you can get it from any location. now you don't have to use the Tv. I rate about four stars.
A14KUQ0C1SF3BF B00CWY76CC 4 1375833600 141 I had a bit of fun with this game and while some of the rooms were rather easy, still enjoyed playing.As of this writing I've completed the game (it took a few days of on-and-off play) and am waiting for new levels.  The one drawback is that the solutions were what I would call &#34;eventual&#34;.  Since there are limited options on what you can select and utilize, I found myself working through some of the puzzles using a process of elimination.  Granted, some of the codes (color sequences, for example) required clues as a brute force attack would have taken too long in my opinion.  But those clues were readily available from other tasks in the rooms.All in all I had some fun and may utilize this type of game/puzzle with my sons to help them develop their problem solving skills.
A14KUQ0C1SF3BF B009UX2YAC 4 1369872000 45 Picked this up a few months ago after seeing my boys play it. I consider it an easy way to waste away some time that requires just a little digit dexterity. I do like that you dont have to spend money to enjoy the game.
A14KUQ0C1SF3BF B009PCBEPE 5 1353888000 57 Maybe there are zombie sympathizers in your family who are offended by this game.  If so, I would like to offer you an apology.  I would like to, but I won't.Some of the levels are very difficult to complete with 3 stars, but as a vehicle to pass some time, there are worse things you can do.
A14KUQ0C1SF3BF B008194C74 5 1338163200 21 Have played half of the first section and so far it has been great fun.  Looking forward to the later sections.
A14KUQ0C1SF3BF B007KOKIK6 5 1353888000 37 I picked this up as an application my 4-yr old can enjoy.  Mission accomplished.  And with him being a member of the Short Attention Span Theater ensemble I see no need to invest in a for-fee version.
A14KUQ0C1SF3BF B00CTQ6SIG 3 1375833600 190 I picked up this application because I used to enjoy watching the television show and thought it  might be some fun.In short, the game plays like myriad others where you build a community and fund your work with scripted actions (ie. clean up Springfield, shop at the Kwik-e-mart, etc.), the buildings you construct and (potentially spending really currency).  Probably the most fun is hearing the cast member voices for some of the interactions.Beyond that, it's so-so with very little beyond what you can find elsewhere.  As mentioned, the financial hook is there (for example, buy donuts to speed up time when constructing buildings) along with community interactions (visiting the 'Springfields' of other players).  But like the other games of this genre, the repetition for me has quickly eroded the fun.  My 11-year old has played with it a little, but after a few weeks I find less reason to spend any more time with it.Maybe I would feel differently if I wasn't working +8 hours a day and busy with so many other things.  Or if this game had come out before. But I've already seen and done this before.
A14L2S1099LRW5 B007D3BQY6 3 1355270400 33 I got this as a free app of the day. I was intrigued by the idea of a dream interpreter however I didn't find it to be intuitive enough to use consistently. YMMV.
A14L2WV9GVOTDM B007JYI4SU 1 1338076800 30 okay. this app said I was gloomy then depressed then terrible then sad then overjoyed. Um..............I THINK NOT....I mean what the heck. I am soooooo deleting this app.  PEACE.  ~WES~
A14L2WV9GVOTDM B00B7PKAKC 5 1360368000 30 This game was awesome! It has zombies but it isn't scary for little kids. Please get this game it is amazing and will keep you entertained for a long time!
A14L2WV9GVOTDM B00992CF6W 3 1370995200 51 When I first downloaded this game it was amazing. But now after the update it is flickering and spazzing out. I don't think I paid 6.99 for this. I don't know. If it is fixed I will write a better review. But as of now 3 stars. Oh and I'm 13.
A14L49RFD8DK5T B006HJKKCG 4 1360108800 20 In Mexico it gives me everthing I need and more.  Flawless on thebasic stuff.  Great app.  give it a try
A14L4KOYL032MR B007U8JRWW 3 1363392000 23 Seems alright....  but the cameras are jumpy.  I expected it, but it is really bad.  There are a lot to choose from though.
A14L6UVYA07Z3Q B008B88LEU 5 1340064000 36 I loved triple town on the phone and finally being able to play on kindle without sideloading is awesome. with the addition of amazon game service this is the best version of the game out there!
A14L6UVYA07Z3Q B0051W73RA 5 1328400000 63 everything about this game is great. hours of fun, a good challenge and with enough detailed strategy to allow for a deeper experience. great game only flaw is that about 2-3% of the time you will try to select one of your party and they'll be too close to get the right one... but that's more an issue of positioning than anything else
A14L6UVYA07Z3Q B00658U5HE 5 1339632000 39 great app. its let me figure out what apps to stop using so much or at least which ones drain my batter. I'm sure the of version is much better optimized. but this world fine too! and its free!
A14L9HJHMWBTJ8 B004HM35RC 5 1331942400 25 Adults and kids like this game, great for when you got to kill a few minutes.  Addicting sometimes.  Good for ages 8 - 60 :-)
A14LA82BFHI28 B008D29K7G 3 1356739200 27 I love fox news, i watch it everyday and that is how i keep in touch with the world.  the app is pretty good about doing that
A14LA82BFHI28 B006QYWIO0 5 1358035200 26 I am always checking my account, so I got this app for my new kindle fire and it works great for constantly checking your account status.
A14LA82BFHI28 B008R5RGAC 4 1358035200 20 I needed protection for my new kindle fire and this seems to work well with it.  I would recommend it.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00D99XZCY 4 1372636800 68 Personally, I find the storyline more understandable than the &quot;newer&quot; or higher rated games. Although sometimes I have been stuck for a few minutes, I find it a CHALLENGE rather than to immediately seek a solution and rather welcome the idea of a true 'hint' rather than the answer...I did want to play a game!  That being said, it isn't perfect, but it's free (at least SO FAR).
A14LDER06DYXUR B009NF54ZE 5 1385164800 51 The game is a little wordy, but otherwise the puzzles are decent. I AM NOT ONE TO COMPLAIN WHEN IT'S FREE!!!  Graphics are very nice. There is the ability to enlarge the screen for the search puzzles, which is nice for us &quot;older&quot; people (LOL). Overall great game for the price.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00E8KLWB4 5 1400025600 61 I'm always looking for a decent (FREE) game for my trusty old Kindle and this seems to be pretty good so far. It's got a lot of the hidden objects - which I'm NOT really a fan of - but, the game has so much potential [there's a BUNCH of locked areas to poke through yet] who knows what's in store!
A14LDER06DYXUR B0097GVJWQ 5 1372377600 68 This was great fun. I wish was that there were as much &quot;puzzle&quot; games as hidden objects- and better instructions, as some were confusing- but with the skip option that was inconsequential. The one nice thing about the hidden objects is that I played this along with my 7 yr old and he was able to complete those and I was able to do the more complex puzzles.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00FVVR2ZO 4 1400371200 33 I'm in the early stages, but so far so good on my Kindle Fire 1st Gen. I'm the type that likes to play WITHOUT paying, so I'll have to sed how it goes.
A14LDER06DYXUR B0066T8SDU 5 1339113600 48 I have never had any problems with the program. The dictionary feature is helpful. The teacher feature which allows the player see what would have been their best play is a great way to learn new words and to be made aware of potential future plays. Great game!
A14LDER06DYXUR B008XG1X18 4 1346457600 49 I LOVE being able to use it, however, that being said...there are still &quot;bugs&quot; to be worked out! Sometimes I cannot get into the program, othertimes it shuts down on me; but, the majority of the time it works ok. Overall, the program is free, so I can't complain!
A14LDER06DYXUR B00COVCV50 5 1372464000 33 I love this game. Most puzzles are fairly easy to figure out.  You earn a modest 3 coins per puzzle, and only use 20 coins per hint when needed. Very nicely set up.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00ATDOVNK 5 1372550400 57 Previous reviews stated full version was .99-$4.99. Definitely worth  .99, but I personally wouldn't pay $4.99 for any game that I'd only play once.  I'm having a little bit of trouble following along, but they asked me to write this review early in the game...so I'm hoping to catch on soon (only just entered the second structure).
A14LDER06DYXUR B0091REZMW 4 1400371200 79 I have a Kindle Fire 1st Gen and it seems to run smoothly. I haven't had a chance yet to figure out some of the details (like how to zoom in on the photos- it's possible, I did it, but I'm not sure how I managed to do it) as they're asking for a review so early: pretty much after the tutorial. I was looking for another game like G5's 'The Secret Society' - this seems to be similar.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00EBQRSTK 5 1376870400 80 I'm a middle aged adult using a Kindle Fire. SO FAR the game has been on the  easy side (I'm on level 30 something). My 7 year old son was able to get most of the answers on his own, so it's fun to play with him. I think that -again, SO FAR, it's a little TOO EASY for MY taste. I will continue to play to see if it progressively gets harder. The game runs smoothly on my device.
A14LDER06DYXUR B0063GORYU 5 1388880000 37 I play it horizontally so that the cards are larger. It is nice to have a hint option (I use it as a backup to be sure I have made all plays).  I love it, no problems.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00IYOACQ6 4 1399507200 71 I liked it A LOT.  A few puzzles were a little too challenging (honestly, I have NO idea where they arrived at a couple of the conclusions) but, thankfully there was a walkthrough to help out with the few I did have problems with. Other than those, the game had a nice flow and good graphics. All in all, it was a lot of fun and I just LOVED the price!
A14LDER06DYXUR B0080H2TFE 5 1358035200 32 Fun &amp; challenging. I'm having trouble getting past the mid 20 levels (7), but having fun trying!  Works great on the Kindle Fire. Great game, and can't beat the price (FREE)!!  :)
A14LDER06DYXUR B0063IH60K 5 1372896000 55 It's free, and SO worth the inconvenience of the infrequent advertisements used to pay for the site. I like the overall setup. The option of being able to chose a random or winning hand, having a 'hint' button available, and being able to undo a play, makes this game a REAL KEEPER in my book!
A14LDER06DYXUR B007PW1BZY 5 1333670400 51 Great game; just as fun as the original. I like being able to play solo and the convenience and portability it offers. It's also easy to learn for those who may never have played it, yet challenging to win.  It also is being sold right now at a good price too!
A14LDER06DYXUR B00BX736EG 5 1400198400 52 As all of the games that I've purchased from this developer (so far) this game runs beautifully. Some pictures are repeats that were shown in prior editions, but half of the time I can't remember what the answer was anyway, so it isn't a major distraction. A great game for the price.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00FAPF5U0 5 1382313600 139 I'm a cheapskate and not one to shovel out REAL CASH for power ups. I like the challenge of trying to get through the levels on my own, and that's not easy! It takes me several tries (lives) and the next thing I know, I'm out of lives and have to wait (insert here whatever time they tell me) before I can try again. That's disappointing...especially after I'm JUST getting to the point where I'm 'almost'  it. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the idea of using the #of moves vs. a timed feature for most of the games. It takes a lot of the pressure off. It would be helpful if the game could give explanations of the &quot;special candy's individual powers&quot; rather than making you figure it out on your own: BUT, hey, it's FREE.  I can't really complain!
A14LDER06DYXUR B00BMNM4H6 5 1379289600 58 I loved this game. It started off easy enough, then progressively became VERY challenging, yet not enough to give up! I do wish there was an eraser on the game mode...and I don't know how many times I mistakenly hit the restart button instead of the up/down which drove me CRAZY!! Otherwise, this is a SURE ALLTIME FAVORITE.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00JE7XQI8 4 1399593600 83 I'm not that far into the game yet, and it's asking for a review in exchange for coins.  The ONLY complaint I have is that each room so far- again, I think it is only room 5 (of which rooms 1-3 were tutorials) and each had one or two simple actions to complete.  I am hoping that it becomes more complex and challenging as the game progresses.  All-in-all, the graphics are nice, it seems to run smoothly and it's FREE....what's to complain about?
A14LDER06DYXUR B00EDQ35D6 5 1397779200 44 So far it has been fairly simple (it's still early in the game), so I hope it gets more challenging as it goes.  It runs smoothly on my 1st Gen Kindle- and downloaded with no problems. Everything one could ask in a FREE game.
A14LDER06DYXUR B00BX42FLY 5 1397520000 50 This is a very challenging game and works smoothly on my device. I like it very much! I would recommend it to anyone who likes to stimulate their mind. (We enjoy to play it as a family, with my youngest son typing the answer in- aids in his spelling too!).
A14LDER06DYXUR B0087TQYUG 4 1339545600 107 Not a very thorough tutorial, a solitaire mode would be very beneficial. I'm a regular "boggle" player, so I felt comfortable playing this online; however, I was surprised my first time playing...even after reading the help section. I was "tapping" the letters instead of sliding from letter-to-letter and I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong for the longest time. The "coin" idea is strange. The Inspire,  Freeze and Scramble options are different,  fun and new. This game is definitely fun, but as a newbie I would like to practice on my own and wish that the makers would have an option for a single mode.
A14LJ08SHW9XOZ B0094BB4TW 3 1372982400 36 A lot of what I do on FB can't be done on this app.  I do a lot of pictures, videos, and things like that.  I don't play games so I can't speak to that feature.
A14LJ08SHW9XOZ B005WVJGT8 3 1359244800 24 moves a little slow. Not the best hearts game I have played. If you like hearts on windows you probably won't like this much.
A14LJ08SHW9XOZ B006P57MUK 4 1372982400 26 I like that I can check what is at my favorite kiosk.  There have been a few times the app has &#34;crashed,&#34; but it is convenient.
A14LJ08SHW9XOZ B0089BPEZS 4 1372982400 24 I have had very little issue with buffering or picture problems. I like that I get a bigger screen than on my smart phone.
A14LJ08SHW9XOZ B00B4G3MV8 1 1372982400 20 Couldn't get it to work at all! It wouldn't recognize my cable provider or log-in info. I wouldn't bother trying.
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B006PKQQSE 5 1359158400 35 if you love playing g the actual card game this app is for you. the only thing I wish was different is that the score would show all the time not just after each hand
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B0066T8SDU 1 1328832000 38 When it works it is a great game,however I have to uninstall and reinstall almost after each session. The single player game works all the time. It seems to have problems updatind with facebook games and ea games.
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B00E3WJRIM 1 1393372800 57 Have attempted many times to report crashing issues etc on my kindle fire and kindle fire HDX but nothing has been fixed software version hasn't changed since I first started using it. I have finally gave up using it on my kindle. Completely different software version on my android phone and it works much better on that
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B00CH26TL8 4 1381795200 26 very much the same game except on facebook when you get a wish for 24 hours it doesn't work on the kindle version of the app.
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B00CKW6FVE 5 1370044800 36 love tetris now I can play it free on my kindle. like the boosts but just as much fun without them no need to spend money (unless you NEED to be the top of your leaderboard)
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B00AV8YANY 5 1392768000 69 Love this game. Just started playing a day ago and already addicted. Works great, haven't had any issues with bugs etc. Haven't tried all the modes yet. Just using the find the words in the list so far. Learning lots of new words too because if you don't know the word in the list and you click on it, it will open up a wiki page with the definition
A14LJ8YLG17U3F B0064X7B4A 5 1369267200 24 It is a great game learn a lot of new words although it doesn't accept some words that are in the dictionary.  very addictive.
A14LO0U7XLOJTJ B008K6G8CK 1 1372982400 21 Don't waste your time. Every time I tried to play a game it would always get stuck. Got sick of waiting
A14LO0U7XLOJTJ B00FI1759K 5 1397433600 20 I love looking for hidden objects and this game has got it. Many different levels and ways to challenge yourself.
A14LOENC0YMOF7 B00G5LQ5MU 3 1384646400 30 This game is alright. There's nothing to special about it, but it's still fun to play for a while. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a little challenge.
A14LOENC0YMOF7 B00EDEMLTW 4 1378080000 37 Fun, entertaining, some levels take a couple times playing, but have finished them all... Not enough levels.. I did them all in a couple days. Going back through them now to get three stars on every level.
A14LOENC0YMOF7 B004LZIZHU 3 1345334400 20 Downloaded this game for our kindle Fire. Runs great and is a fun. For a free game its worth it..
A14LOENC0YMOF7 B00FAPF5U0 3 1383436800 29 Fun game, we were waiting for it to come out for the kindle.. however some boosts should be free... it's crazy to want to charge people all the time.
A14LSZSNIYM4WM B00FLMU7BY 3 1392163200 22 Not sure what the game was about.  Downloaded it.  Got stuck. Googled the answers. Curiosity was satisfied.  Realized not my personal favorite.
A14LSZSNIYM4WM B0067VKQLE 5 1402272000 21 Yep.  Can't put it down.  The ultimate rush is on the rooftop at the end.  Lots of help on the web.
A14LSZSNIYM4WM B005HSL626 3 1392163200 21 Tried it several times, enjoyed it, now I am done. Moving on to other games that may end up being interesting.
A14LSZSNIYM4WM B008Y2FRFO 3 1392163200 22 It is what the title says.  Not sure why I thought it would end up being more than that.  Still enjoyed it.
A14LSZSNIYM4WM B00L3MNCNQ 5 1404950400 19 This game reminds me of 5 spots.  So far you are required to find 5 differences in each game.
A14LTUC9YXWXI8 B00BTL5YMI 5 1379980800 39 This game is great fun love it! Recommended by me to anyone if you enjoy slots !I am at a stand still at this time? CONTINUES TO SAY I NEED AN UPDATE IN ORDER TO PLAY?CAN'T FIND THE UPDATE?
A14LTUC9YXWXI8 B007TO3JW6 5 1375488000 55 This is a great game though it was much better before the update also make sure!!!!!!!!!! Make sure!!!!!!!!! Can't say this enough that you are not being charged to play I had over 2500 dollars worth of charges on my amazon account from this game so I recommend delete all credit/debit cards from your device!!!!!!!
A14LTUC9YXWXI8 B0081JPTXK 4 1378339200 20 This is a fun app but very slow and not very informing overall it's good but could be much better
A14LTUC9YXWXI8 B00BN6K97Y 5 1374105600 34 I just want to introduce myself my name is Humptey pronounced with an umpteyJust kidding this is a great game I the parent actually get to play when kids go to bed very fun
A14LWADTSWENYX B008O7EOEE 2 1376524800 22 I don't this app is very appropriate I think there are better apps out there, sorry but I did not care for
A14LWADTSWENYX B00636V5CM 3 1376524800 20 This app was okay I really just wanted to check it out on my kindle and it was just ok
A14LWADTSWENYX B00CRFAAYC 2 1376524800 20 This app was downloaded by  my grand daughter and she really seems to enjoy playing this game so great deal
A14LWADTSWENYX B007ZGO7EM 5 1376524800 21 This is another fine application that was free for my kindle fire and I would recommend it is handy and great
A14LWADTSWENYX B006RXD2I6 5 1376524800 26 I love this app, I play a lot of card games and this is a nice app because there are so many games to pick from
A14LX9PVHDGW4N B00BT1SL50 5 1364083200 20 I am having a great time playing with this game.  It is a great time killer.  Well worth the price.
A14LX9PVHDGW4N B008RA3X5E 3 1358812800 80 This alarm clock does what it suppose to.  I would like it more if it did a little more.  For example, it would be great If it could offer a random play feature of music lists.  Also if it would be better if it offered a soft to loud wake-up feature.  Finally, the sleep timer should allow the app to return to the clock face.  But I got this for the alarm and it does a good job at that.
A14LXZORXAAKN8 B0097EWK3A 5 1388707200 31 I can't even describe who incredible this game is.  It was so worth the $3.00 it took to get the full game.  I can't wait till I get the second one.
A14LXZORXAAKN8 B00FS0VUWO 4 1385683200 24 This game is really fun.  It's hard at first but when you start to get the hang of it, it becomes so much easier.
A14LXZORXAAKN8 B00AA87JGU 5 1375401600 23 I absolutely love this game I just bought it today and I'm already so far ahead of what I thought I would be.
A14LYR876HDZHJ B006T01L30 1 1354492800 21 I don't get the concept, I don't get how to Dp this game,, and I don't get why this game was.invented!
A14LYR876HDZHJ B005V1N71W 3 1355011200 22 I LOVE THIS THING NOW DOUDT ABOUT IT. I FOUND SO MANY NEW FRIENDS AND I GOT MY 1ST BOYFRIEND ON HERE!!!!!
A14LYR876HDZHJ B006N1K1AE 5 1356134400 23 I love this thing!! its so cool and it makes u connect with your creative outlet making your imagination come out of u.
A14LZSGAJ9RYK9 B004GYY714 5 1377820800 20 this is a great app to listen to music and there is lots of stations i would recommend it!! !!
A14LZSGAJ9RYK9 B00B2V66VS 2 1360368000 80 it is a very fun game. but once i had to remove it from my kindle fire then download it again. now i press on the app it brings me to the  &quot;i&quot; opening page then kicks me off. its annoying because im like at level 10 so i have to remove it from my kindle and put it back. im also annoyed cause i just bought barry bones. the app wont load any more and im really really annoyed.
A14LZSGAJ9RYK9 B006D1ONE4 5 1330905600 21 I love this game!!!! and when if updated to &quot;meet crancky&quot; I bought it and that was really fun!!!!! great app
A14M406IE3VNPL B00CJ8P82Q 5 1376611200 26 this is an amazing game could play for hours a very challenging game and addicting I love games like this there should be more like it
A14M406IE3VNPL B00CF6J2G0 5 1391472000 20 a very entertaining game I play for hours. it keeps. you alert and I enjoy coming home and play it
A14M4NE6VVDWO7 B007U7BIO8 5 1360454400 61 This is the best alarm clock app out there yet infact i like that you can set lets say you want to get up at 6:30am every moring mon thru friday you get a list of the days of the week sun thru sat and you check off the days you wnat the alarm to run and never miss work again.
A14M5VW2VJXE97 B00A4KVFLY 5 1374364800 49 If u type something and it isn't showing it gives u an X  I love the game a lot recommend for older people in other words not kids without help I play with my mom she is a teacher but isn't good at some questions(Sorry mom but it's true
A14M5VW2VJXE97 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1374278400 37 Super funny but takes awhile to get more used to it!  I have been playing it for awhile Once u get on higher levels for example now night hawk diner is over 10,000 makes u laugh reccomend!
A14M5VW2VJXE97 B00BUIPN62 5 1374364800 46 First of all it has bigger screen (the bigger the better) Secondly iPhone has a score limit now which when I got the app on my kindle fire it is way better and no more small screen for me I deleted the app on my iphone
A14M5VW2VJXE97 B008OOYALE 4 1374278400 21 It always shows pop ups to waste your gold!  Please stop making pop ups! Other than that it is fun! Recommended
A14MA947OXSZPH B007N5YIUS 5 1357689600 26 I actually down loaded this one for the Grand sons on my Kindle. I like to play it too. It is a fun game to play.
A14MA947OXSZPH B009RAQGLG 5 1361923200 26 I am liking this one. I love hidden object games. The ghosts appear and disappear in this one. The objects are not too hard to find.
A14MA947OXSZPH B009UX2YAC 5 1370390400 22 I let my seven year old Grandson down load this one onto my Kindle. He loves it as does his older brother.
A14MA947OXSZPH B009ZXT4BY 5 1357689600 25 This one is a taste of Mine Craft. It is for the Grandsons. They enjoy playing on the Kindle. They want the whole game now.
A14MA947OXSZPH B008R9OIUO 5 1361923200 28 I enjoyed  this game. It is a teaser for the  full  version. It was a little hard to see the object some times, but the hint works well.
A14MB49H3GH1N2 B00I10HCV6 5 1400457600 29 TOTALLY DIG THESE GAMES. ALMOST ALL OF THE G5 GAMES. I JUST WISH THERE WERE MORE FOR FREE...LIKE THE WHOLE GAME, NOT JUST A FEW LEVELS. STILL REALLY FUN
A14MB49H3GH1N2 B00GIZO674 5 1400025600 82 I never use In-App purchasing until I plus this game...TOTALLY worth it!!! : )  Even if you are like me and have no exceptions for In-App purchasing, you can play 2 levels in Story Mode before it's time to pay. Even still, you'll have full access to other modes of play. TOTALLY chill, TOTALLY funny and Seriously addictive!  But in a good way...I swear!!! : p. Worth the space on your device, worth the time &amp; ACTUALLY worth the money! : )
A14MB49H3GH1N2 B00GOZQ2E8 5 1398124800 24 I love how the town's set up and the art is great. The characters are so cute!!  It's just a fun easy going game.
A14MB49H3GH1N2 B00JVZ0DQG 5 1401840000 59 I love all the different features. It's not just farming. Plus the option to join co-op's and ADD facebook friends. The feature that is truly different from other farming games is the ability to play the game on your pc and although it's not identical, you still have goals that exsist between the two games. SUPER FUN!! : )
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00KQHVWWC 1 1405814400 4 total waste of time
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00BYG452I 5 1373760000 32 I like this game it's fun to play with family. I don't some are pretty hard so the easy for  the younger and adults can answer the hard. It's worth a try
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00702PZME 5 1389052800 34 I thought this would be silly for kids. I was amazed how fun this is . I am 57 and its a little hard for me.but u get the words .  Very good game
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00CTN0ALA 1 1395273600 24 hard to see even on 8.9 real waste of code if u ask me still looking for a decent holdem site most are bogus
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00CX9P6V4 5 1392854400 75 I give this five stars because it is a fun game. Not for free coins. The pics are so far kinda easy so young and old can play.so I have down loaded were so hard couldn't play them . I am 56 and like this game. Plays great on my kindle fire. If you want a fun game to guess the pic as you remove blocks and is easy. This is the game for you
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00C6RHC1A 4 1372204800 23 Very fun. It can be pretty hard makes you really think. I love this game. It helps keep your brain in top shape
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00AHUEUGS 5 1372118400 24 Fun game nice story if you like stuff about big foot then you will like this one. A little dark in places. But fun
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00G4FAU14 1 1395273600 21 could be fun if u weren't pounded to buy chips every other hand don't waste your time I wish I hadnt
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00IG63BVK 1 1405814400 5 too pushy to buy coins
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00GMIB0O4 1 1395273600 20 they want u to buy every level don't waste a minute of your time its bogus no fun either garbage
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00CAW96DI 5 1372723200 22 This game is a lot of fun. Can be mind boggling also. Great way to have fun and keep the thinker working
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00EOUGFNS 5 1405814400 2 enjoy accessibilty
A14MBWDHZ580GW B006P4FBUE 5 1392768000 78 Just to let people know I can not play sing or clap music. Got this in free loved it. Than got full for 99  I played ten songs that my family guessed the off I am 57 and it was fun. . This is good on no clue fire HD works fine sou d in real good. It's well worth 99  you will have fun .little hard to get both hands on but it's not a tea piano
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00COVCV50 4 1372032000 32 Lot of fun not to hard.Good way to pass time. This is a fun game to play with family also. I am a grandma so this is nice to test your braln
A14MBWDHZ580GW B00CDBLC8S 4 1372032000 25 Lot of fun. Makes you think of the tiles you want to remove. Good for a group to play also I really like this game
A14MHETJME6O2N B00FAX6XQC 1 1404432000 30 Are u kiding me?!?!  It takes FOREVER to load!!! And my kindle shut down twice! DONT GET THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!! Ugh, why can't I put it at 0 stars?
A14MHETJME6O2N B00D2K40WY 4 1405987200 35 This game is fun, but some of the dresses and make ups are locked and they look so cool! So, I'd take off one star for that. Also, u only get to play ONE PRINCESS!!!!!
A14MSW4W1LAXT8 B00AEEZK70 2 1358899200 36 I wasn't able to discern a difference between the two colors when I started playing the game which made it totally unplayable for me. Having the ability to change the palate would be a welcome option.
A14MSW4W1LAXT8 B00640UICA 5 1378252800 57 Got this as a free game of the day.  Well-made, kind of warms the cockles of your heart with the cutesy graphics and sounds. Good for several hours of solving fun, but once I beat it, that was it. No replay value for me. I'd say it's a dollar worth of fun per person that'll play it.
A14MTV8PZLLR8C B00AJ1EWRM 5 1380931200 25 This is a cute and fun game for toddlers. Very easy for them to play. My grandchildren and I love to play this game together.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B004M6B1NI 5 1308528000 18 This app has saved me so much money since downloading.  Convenient, concise and easy to search.  Highly recommended!
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B0058W5D0W 5 1310601600 35 I love this app and am changing my review to 5 stars!  Thank you for listening, developers!  I have alreadyin used this several times and am quite happy with the results.  Keepin' this one.  Droidx.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B008194C74 3 1337904000 39 I haven't played this yet and downloaded it just to point something out.  It's quote/END quote people.  If you make a word game, at least make sure your usage is correct.  Hopefully the game is better than the title.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B0085P2Z6E 3 1361059200 88 I was truly enjoying this game until I reached the level (I think 8) where you had to look for things with a &quot;spotlight&quot;.  Unfortunately,  what was a challenge became ridiculous because the spotlight &quot;snapped&quot; to my finger so that I couldn't find anything since the visible part was now under my fingertip.  I got so frustrated I eventually quit and see no point in continuing.  Make the spot bigger or let me drag it by the edge.  The way it is set up currently is not useable.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B004L07KWQ 4 1318550400 118 Basic fun doodling app.  Note:  SHAKE to clear all; back button to clear one stroke at a time.  There are similar apps out there with random brush styles as well as color, which I like, but this is good too.  The way in which you can change backgound color is cumbersome and a change in that process would make the app better.One thing I really like about this one is that you can give your phone to your kids to play with and, unless they push a menu button, they can't accidently add or delete something while they play.  The app takes the whole screen and a gives kids a blank slate while keeping my screens safe.  Droidx.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B006MHWXMS 5 1325721600 127 I know there are list apps out there that have tons of options and extras,  and I've tried more than I wish to count.  This one,  however, has won my vote BECAUSE of its simplicity.  I can organize my to do's under my choice of list title,  move things around and prioritize.  I can set up reminders and back things up to Google.  Its not a perfect app,  but for me,  its as good as it gets.  AND it doesnt cost 25 bucks a year to use like one app I tried.My one comment toward improvement is to give a date layout option.  The European layout of day first,  then month threw me at first.  I can live with it but an American option would be nice.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B004S2W37O 2 1315180800 79 I have loved Cozi to keep track of family activity and tolerated the ads on the website and my phone.  I was so excited when the paid version became the free app if the day.  Not so excited now as I see the &quot;paid&quot; version is now &quot;free&quot;  and the ads are back.  I just feel sorry for those who DID pay for it.  I'm sure glad I didn't now.  So annoyed, I'm not sure I want it anymore
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B008N8IV2U 2 1350864000 65 I wouldn't mind the ads so much but they flash constantly and get to be so annoying I had to quit.  And I'm truly getting tired of reading about all the sexy girls that want to talk to me, let alone my kids.  I just don't think those ads should be on a game like this.  Can't even think to figure out the puzzles.  Sheesh.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B00881PTRC 3 1366761600 48 The color choice for some of the letters make them hard to see.  Also the dark blue selection bar obliterated the subject choice.  Cute idea but have no idea what the words were when I got them wrong because the letters were in yellow against the yellowish background.
A14MV1O6SJ4ZQP B004W89LGU 5 1312588800 23 One of my very favorite phone games.  The puzzles are just difficult enough (so far)... colors are bright, love the &quot;story.&quot;  DROIDX w\/gingerbread.
A14MYHK0W4OG7T B00G5LQ5MU 3 1388016000 30 This game seems to be a real brain teaser. I am looking forward to seeing what else it holds. You never know what you are coming to run into next.
A14MYHK0W4OG7T B00JTKDTLE 5 1400198400 20 This game is pretty fun and the music is very relaxing but it can still be challenging! I Love it!
A14MYHK0W4OG7T B007SYWFRM 3 1390867200 35 Lots of fun but does get a little repetitive and boring. Other than that it's easy to play and there are lots of opportunities to level up without having to sink real money into it.
A14MZBFHVTPKF B008TQ16OG 5 1388880000 45 fun game, very addictive. should be free like it is for android but at least it's only .99&cent;. My 4 yr old and 12 yr old kids love it and hubby too. just be sure to lock purchases, since there are in app purchases available.
A14MZBFHVTPKF B0080IOHLW 3 1336867200 23 I love dragons. and other -magical. thingsand I like the money but I cant keep enough yellow things and I like the jobs
A14MZBFHVTPKF B0076ANQQC 4 1333238400 45 works great on my kindle fire and my 2 yr old son loves this game. he loves all the cute animal effects, might end up having to purchase full version. keeps him entertained long enough to switch over the laundry and unload dishwasher everyday lol
A14MZBFHVTPKF B004SZHD3K 4 1329436800 101 At first I thought it was real money to but it's not. when you first start using this app it asks you to startup with a buy in of up to $20 "cash" in exchange for chips but it's not $20 cash it's virtual cash, I checked my credit card and there are no charges. As you play you when you win large amounts it exchanges your "chips" for "cash" (virtual cash). Also love the free wheel spin and poker mini games This is a really fun game and its super awesome that it's FREE to purchase and FREE to Play.
A14MZJTZAQS6CV B008655OVQ 5 1355788800 41 This was totally 100% FREE. Everything FREE if good, except for STD's. Those aren't any good at all, unless you are a research Scientist studying it's effects which means &#34;Pass me another notebook  cause I doing some writing on this subject.
A14MZJTZAQS6CV B008D29K7G 2 1355875200 25 This functions only when it wants to. It sits on my iPad looking like the FOX icon useless and benign the rest of the time.
A14N1W7MKCJMNJ B006AZZPCM 4 1369785600 76 This app is great it is everything like YouTube except for me sometimes when I watch a video that bar that tells u the time of the video is all the way like it is finished but the video is still going and the screen is black and I have to turn it off and on so it will work again it sounds like a lot of work but it's not it just gets me mad
A14N1XIIWI0TE7 B00850NK6I 5 1400025600 50 I have fallen in love with ebooks.  Now I am able to read those things that I can't get locally at the public library plus catch up on titles on my looong list of to read books!  Just discovered again how great audiobooks are in the car on long drives.
A14N1XIIWI0TE7 B0087TQYUG 5 1396915200 28 This has quickly become my favorite game. It works great on the Kindle Fire and rarely crashes.  I can't believe it took me so long to discover it.
A14N6QKQ1QV9KY B004H2MGOU 5 1357862400 20 good competition game with the kids when you are at a restaurant or sitting somewhere killing some time is perfect
A14N7PCJFRMH5V B007JPG04E 4 1335312000 22 Awesome game feel like you are playing on a real console just wish aiming could be easier more realistic. to the fkngers
A14N7PCJFRMH5V B0087TUZII 4 1344902400 25 I like the game it's start slow but gets better. Wish that the game could be played on a larger screen with a faster processor.
A14N7PGA6DPPLI B00785P2QC 4 1383436800 23 Not everyone wants to post a zillion posts on Facebook, and your friends don't like it either, otherwise this is a good app
A14N7PGA6DPPLI B00B116U0G 5 1360540800 24 this game rewards you  via pocket change,which you get coins every day and trade them for stuff like Nike fuelbands,PS3s and stuff like that.
A14N9YGGSY9MWQ B00IZ60WJA 4 1397865600 38 This is a nice little app for a dollar. I am not sure that you can't find the same content elsewhere though.  This is enjoyable for old movie and old tv buffs.there are some good old cartoons too.
A14N9YGGSY9MWQ B00BQPEIT2 5 1379116800 36 This is addictive and fun. This was money well spent. The scenery is beautifully designed. I like that if you die it lets you pick up where you left off or at least close to it.
A14NATD3Z5M3C0 B0064X7FVE 4 1361750400 20 It gives me current weather for my city quickly and also has other options to see extended forecasts, etc.  Thanks.
A14NATD3Z5M3C0 B005V1N71W 3 1392336000 50 except for the interruptions by commercials, i like it so far...  don't really want to pay for a better version though.  but having a bit of a problem figuring out how to add other artists to the &#34;channel&#34; i created.  but really haven't spent a bunch of time looking yet.
A14NAUYC6CGPDG B0088P2A7A 5 1358812800 20 Who doesn't use wikipedia at some point in their lives? A valuable tool for anyone looking for information. It's invaluable!
A14NAUYC6CGPDG B007SYDYLS 5 1358812800 35 This is a great game to play... Helps your mind with word association. No timers, no scores. Perfect for when your brain starts turning to pudding and you want it to go back to noodles!
A14NAUYC6CGPDG B00AA0TJO8 1 1355011200 68 I've saved those penguins so many times, I'm starting to look like them!I'm super fast through level two, with a big congratulations!  Then I'm back to winter wonderland, but never a level three!  What gives?  Am I missing something?I'd love to give more stars, but with two levels that take about 40 seconds to complete together, not worth it! I could have used that buck for something else!
A14NAUYC6CGPDG B005ZXWMUS 5 1358812800 22 Worth every penny of eight dollars a month. See shows and movies you thought you would never find again! What a bargain!
A14ND8ZOB7CLMS B0067R0APK 5 1386288000 24 Weather prediction seems like a fortune teller. 50/50 chance of being right or wrong.  If YOU SEE ANIMALS RUNNING IN PANIC, Run  with them.
A14ND8ZOB7CLMS B0064X7B4A 4 1386374400 32 I wish they had a version with no ads.  If so I would rate it 5 stars.  The break of those long ad videos was wonderful.  The long ads gave me angst.
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B008B84O6Y 5 1346716800 25 I like discovering things in the forests and the little mouse is my favorite character. I love this game. I could play it all day.
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B008K3OOJM 5 1345939200 19 I love this game. its a good game to her if ur parents wont let u get fish!!!!!!hahahaha awsome
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B008NCUFYS 5 1353715200 22 this is a fun game. I love all the designs for the balls. the fire one is the best ball I think.
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B0085N9I84 5 1346025600 23 I like the game because u get to raise monsters but I don't like the minimum of monsters if u don't buy them.
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B008Y0REKC 5 1346025600 27 the little monsters are so cute. I love this game. I never thought that I would like a game like this but I guess I do. &lt;-&gt;
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B005UQ9FNC 5 1346371200 27 I love this game because my mom wont let me get any birds but guess what now I can...... hays mom take that.... I love u mom
A14NG3JWOIX0SU B009UWL580 5 1353024000 23 I love this game. I get really bord so this game really entertains me. Im really glad that I decited to get it.
A14NHBAHOWL27J B004JZBGWI 4 1360022400 63 Love this notepad for grocerie lists, to do lists, etc. Calendar does not show information on what you have going on that day, just shows a dot of color for something in a specific catagory until you open the day, otherwise I would have given 5 stars. But easy to use, easy to acess lists, very very useful. And free ! yay !
A14NHFLBS7ZA32 B00E78QIDE 4 1377302400 21 Simple and thoughtful little time waster, but enjoyable.  Try it just for the fun of it. Riddles are not always easy.
A14NHFLBS7ZA32 B00FI1759K 1 1382313600 32 There. Are way way too many advertisements. The game play is alright and the difficulty is about right for this type of game, but I cannot recommend it because of the,ads. Sorry.
A14NHFLBS7ZA32 B007ZD17XO 5 1367712000 21 I have played this game on other platforms and I truly love all I have played. Keep them coming. Thanks bunches.
A14NHFLBS7ZA32 B00BGC5UAG 4 1368230400 38 Ok for what it is could be more creative In scoring like take away for hints. And misses.  Could have different .. more .. sounds.  Always allow user to change as the Colors.Billy in th tying and ppl
A14NLWTF0X8Z0S B00AR1AUAW 2 1387238400 29 There's usually a couple of answers that are right but if you don't pick the one the game says is right, you're wrong. I took it off my device.
A14NLWTF0X8Z0S B0066T8SDU 3 1337558400 90 I had this version of Scrabble on my Kindle Fire and it wouldn't work when I tried to play with my sister through Facebook.  I can play it by myself but it won't let me play anyone else.  It used to so I called Kindle and they tried to fix it but couldn't.  I'm STILL WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM SOMEONE SO I PLAY SCRABBLE ON MY KINDLE. If this has happened to you please call Kindle 1-866-321-8851 and report it so maybe they'll start doing something about this problem.
A14NLWTF0X8Z0S B00E3WJRIM 2 1387238400 43 I can't get the game to work. I'd love to play it but even the instructions are wrong. The instructions need to be clearer and there should be &#34;help&#34; buttons on the bottom when you're playing it so you can figure it out.
A14NLWTF0X8Z0S B0063GORYU 5 1326499200 21 THis game has given me hours of fun. The screen is responsive and it passes the hours quickly.  I love it
A14NPMSTSZE7Z B00B49Z8TY 5 1378598400 37 This is my favorite game on my kindle. It works so well, and its such a fun time-passer. I love the categories and everything. I would definitely recommend this game to people who love fashion. 5 stars!
A14NPMSTSZE7Z B00G118LYY 3 1383177600 38 I can't drive how I want to. It's really making me mad. All I want to do is drive and have fun but I can't control it. There are no instructions on how to drive. Please help me!
A14NQDMPB54YFX B0066T0EVE 5 1325030400 22 i love the game, controls take getting used to, especially opening things, but definately a 5 star game, scared me crapless, haha
A14NQDMPB54YFX B00AMPALV6 4 1356998400 22 great time waster but that's about it. no story and not much player-to-player communication but nonetheless still fun and worth the price.
A14NQDMPB54YFX B0054JZC6E 5 1327881600 20 this is a very fun spare time game, easy to play and alot to do, defonately worth the price, haha
A14NQDMPB54YFX B00CHSPB8Y 1 1367712000 24 its the same thing over and over again, I'm glad I didn't have to spend any money on this because I was greatly disappointed
A14NQDMPB54YFX B00CH87HF4 3 1368489600 75 part one : as a game itself, this app plays amazingly well with stunning graphics which we've all come to expect from gameloft, this game features multiple classes with specific upgrades for each allowing an infinite number of combinations.part two : its a money pit!!! you cant advance far in the game at all without having to spend money on things, the game would be much more enjoyable at a fair price with no iap's
A14NQDMPB54YFX B004VGH93A 1 1368403200 34 absolutely lame, these jokes sound like they were written by a two year old, and the only decent ones are the ones everybody has heard a thousand times, uninstalled instantly, not worth the space
A14NQDMPB54YFX B0080K98U0 5 1337212800 35 love the gameplay, worth more than the price and soooo much better than what I expected, I cant put this game down, works great on my kindle fire and I would definately recommend this app
A14NQDMPB54YFX B00A1SL8SE 3 1358553600 23 very simple game. easy to play, good time waster, worth the free sale. wouldn't recommend paying for it though. blab blab blab blab
A14NR8W9C5USVN B007DKC922 5 1332806400 21 enjoyed this game very very much. its fun entertaining and addictive.  works well on the galaxy tab.  gave it five stars
A14NVJA4NLS2FO B004GBARY8 1 1319760000 32 It's a very simple issue that trumps all but malware.  This is 4.16 megs yet can NOT be installed to the SD card, so consider that... nickles and dimes add up quickly.
A14NVSLYWC326M B00CSR2J9I 4 1369785600 29 I really like this app. its fun and challengingm the only thing is that I wish they didn't makenit al easy to flip over. but I like it overall.
A14NVSLYWC326M B008CG839O 5 1358294400 22 I have this on my phone and kindle fire and it works amazing! :) I love this app. it does not freeze.
A14NVSLYWC326M B00846GKTW 5 1377993600 27 I have the other game that I s recommend so I got this one after and I love it. it so much fun and keeps me entertained.
A14NVSLYWC326M B0091REZMW 5 1376006400 44 This is one of my favorite games I have. I don't have to spend real money unless I want to and there are so many different missions for u to complete that you wont have to buy diamonds or coins. I love this game!!
A14NVSLYWC326M B00B49Z8TY 5 1377993600 22 this is a fun game. I really didn't think I would like it but when I started playing it I was addicted.
A14NVSLYWC326M B00CZDSK7K 5 1373414400 26 I got this app because I have the first one on my computer and I love it a lot. this one is just as much fun!
A14NWME4F97AT4 B00G5LQ5MU 5 1384214400 21 Super fun. Free. Awesome. Love it. Buy it. Titanic coolness. BUY IT!!!! LOVE IT!!!! IT S FREE!!!! You should buy it
A14NWME4F97AT4 B00ED4TX2A 5 1376784000 64 It's a super fun game. The only problem is it crashes when you open it. I use a kindle fire HD and I have to try to click on it two or three times. But otherwise it's a really fun game. Btw the energy is gone too quickly but it comes back pretty quickly too. AWESOMELY AWESOME!!!!! Or as my friends would say..... CUPCAKERIFIC!!!!
A14NWME4F97AT4 B00HEVJU7W 4 1390176000 64 So it's a really fun app and it works on my Kindle Fire HD perfectly. At times the app is slow, but it usually works. Most of the full episodes are available, but I can't watch them all because some of them need you to put in your tv provider and sadly, Directv isn't one of them. But other than that it's pretty cool.
A14NWREC1IZVQW B00632HWOG 3 1383696000 64 I like having the ability to check my Yahoo mail from my Kindle Fire, but I do not like that I cannot sign out of the app, leaving my email exposed to anyone, including the kids, whenever I let them borrow my Kindle. There is also a problem with being able to delete emails from the app. As of 11.6.13, these issues still existed.
A14NWVTY3UTQ7A B007ZQK1MY 4 1348099200 32 Liked for the m&oslash;st part.  Was at about 80% complete when my kindle died.  Game went back to beginning instead of saving so I had  to start over.  otherwise I liked it.
A14NWVTY3UTQ7A B004UMLBCA 4 1325808000 41 Never done weight watchers before.  This app makes it so simple for a first timer...can't. imagine what it does for someone who is more familiar with the plan.  Just wish I understood the whole exercise points allowance.  Absolutely recommend this app.
A14NWVTY3UTQ7A B00885MDHM 1 1343865600 26 as soon as I started free download it suddenly gives alert that price has changed???? Wanted 1.99????  Should have let me try it first....forget it now.
A14NYFVNL3NQRL B00ESCOI7C 5 1385769600 21 This app is pretty legit SO far.... simple and easy to understand..n help is easier to obtain than other trivia games.
A14NYFVNL3NQRL B00EBE8MUG 5 1384214400 27 I like that it's graphically blurred n not all crappy cut outs!! And the shows are knowingly true . All in all, fun app SO far!! :)
A14NYFVNL3NQRL B00FXKHEK6 5 1388016000 20 This game is awesome...keeps me entertained for hours ! Love the variety of challenges and keeps on getting. Better .
A14NYFVNL3NQRL B008JK6W5K 5 1386547200 24 I really like this app.. plenty of different varieties ..and levels ...keeps me entertained for hours...never get bored..!!! I love it on this Kindle
A14NYFVNL3NQRL B00E5GJ7QS 5 1396569600 22 Love it. Very fast paced..no missions but love that there are objectives..can jus sit back and pass the time. Very cool app.
A14NYFVNL3NQRL B00DZ22QNO 4 1388016000 38 Just like the original &quot;guess the movie&quot; app, this game is fun and keeps me entertained for hours. I love the variety of movies it has and I learn about new ones too; if I've never seen them.

A14O04UXTDO6TA B007SYWFRM 5 1335571200 31 I found out how to get out of the game. First you go to stuff then click settings. The menu bar should pop up. Its a good game I'm level nine.
A14O04UXTDO6TA B007Z4AKQI 3 1337817600 29 Its a good game until something weird happenedI just logged on and it went through the intro and then the menu darkened and I couldn't play it. be careful
A14O2ZUKQQFDU8 B0071Q75AO 1 1329436800 57 ok so I just woke up and I did the finger scanner then it constly said I was shy. What am I shy about. I'm in my bedroom. I could be shy of my burger (Which is a bank) or how about my cat. sersouly. I do not recomend this to any 1 unless you prank someone.
A14O2ZUKQQFDU8 B00992CF6W 5 1353456000 20 this is the best game to get whether its on a tablet xbox or Pc its really fun to get.
A14O2ZUKQQFDU8 B007U7IKVM 5 1353888000 22 this is the best gun app that I could ever find with amzon . I reccomend this to people who love guns
A14O2ZUKQQFDU8 B007MNV5WU 5 1332633600 37 I have to emit Rovio really started thinking out of the box with this one. this is challenging, has new birds, makes old birds cooler, and different, unquie things. I reccomend this to all angry bird lovers.
A14O39EH4KQAIA B009UX2YAC 5 1377302400 136 I didn't think much about this app when my son asked to download it.  I checked to make sure it was fine...yep, just a running game.A few weeks later, and we are both seriously addicted to this game.  While there are in game purchases available, there is enough you can buy with the coins you collect while running that it doesn't feel like you are being restricted (looking at you, Candy Crush Saga).Premise of the game;  you're being chased by a security guard and his dog after tagging a train car.  I'm glad my son is too young to realize that's what's happening in the beginning.  Otherwise, you simply run and jump and try to go around obstacles.  You can also buy hoverboards and work through challenges to earn extra abilities and point multipliers.Overall, great fun!
A14O39EH4KQAIA B0058VW36U 4 1377302400 91 I recently downloaded this for my six year old son.  He REALLY likes trying to figure out how to solve each level on the game.  I give it a four simply because it is one of those games that can be repetitive after he's done it for a while.  He still thinks it's fun and will go back to it time and time again though.Since we don't have the account backed up with payment (it's on a wifi only device), we haven't run into the purchase problems that others have noted.
A14O39EH4KQAIA B008TY8PKG 4 1377302400 83 My son LOVES this game!  He's a huge fan of Phineas and Ferb (which I think has to be one of the best shows for kids going, btw), so we got this to try it out.  We ended up buying the full version because he loved it so much!  He also has Where's My Water (we got that after this one), so he has lots of practice.  He also loves the comments that the characters from P&F interject while he's playing the game.
A14O44JYVTQIUM B00ESCOI7C 5 1389830400 20 This is  a fun game. It is also challenging and I love a challenge. My son like this game too.
A14O44JYVTQIUM B00CEBKMN8 5 1375488000 45 I love the game and my son loves to play it to. This is awesome. Need more games like this one. And they need to have some like this for kids age 4 cause my little one will play this game till my battery dies
A14O44JYVTQIUM B008L29K6E 4 1381968000 20 I love this game and so does my son. We played for almost three hours straight he had a blast.
A14O5WCG2V3R96 B00594XOZU 5 1388534400 33 Got kik and its a great app to interact with friends if you don't have a phone. I don't have a problem with it saying &amp;#34;taking longer to load&amp;#34; it's an awesome app!
A14O5WCG2V3R96 B009HUBJPO 4 1390435200 55 Awesome app! I love it but if you don't make an account and continue clicking &amp;#34;free calls&amp;#34; it will pop up once in a while and it will continue until you click &amp;#34;sign up&amp;#34;. it is free and you don't need to pay for anything. It makes free calls if you have data or WiFi
A14O5WCG2V3R96 B004MC0FO8 5 1393891200 33 I love this because it helps you find a song when you don't know the name of it also it finds YouTube video for you and on some songs there are lyrics :)
A14O5WCG2V3R96 B008JGSM6G 5 1390348800 31 Great app! My mom and I both love it. Such a fun brain teaser and just to past time and when you don't get it, you aren't frustrated. Must have app!!!
A14O6NNQNVPPVS B007BPYCAG 2 1335571200 33 I was in my room today and as I was playing and a bizzar voice said no nono noooo I'm not lying my parents were sleeping and I have no siblings. good luck
A14O6NNQNVPPVS B0080IOHLW 3 1339113600 27 I HAD 20 FLOORS AND I'D JUST SPENT 2 BUCKS AND THIS MORNING ITS GONE. NOT THERE 20 FLOORS. beware o this money eating awesome game .
A14O6NNQNVPPVS B0061SLW7A 4 1341360000 24 okay but it will say I'm getting a  strange message coming. nonetheless its really good. you can customize your person. its kinds like siri
A14O6UK98VXX0S B00DWJBOI8 5 1376611200 114 This is a beautifully done game. Not too many hidden object puzzles. I love it when you are given a task to find an object in each scene and this game asks you to find a specific number of roses throughout the game. The puzzles varied so you never knew what to expect. The tasks were not too difficult but still took some thought and the scenes were fantastic. My only true complaint is how many times I was asked to rate the game during play...it was too many times. The price was a little steep but worth it although I wished there were more game play...I really didn't want this one to end.
A14O6UK98VXX0S B00B4VI8MQ 4 1367107200 44 This a fun app. The hidden object sections were challenging yet not undoable. The graphics were good. It wasn't long enough for my liking but I still enjoyed the game for a couple hours. I cant wait to try another game by this maker.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B009PSV1HE 4 1353196800 46 Dinner dash is a great time killer, but I hate the fact that you have to buy tips in order to try and get ahead. However, the price was reasonable enough. I wish you could change her outfit like you used to be able to do.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B00CT9ZVGI 5 1380758400 21 Loved the game, loved the suspense. Honestly it was a good game. Loved the story line, can't wait for part 2
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B006D1ONE4 5 1330214400 25 way better than angry birds, great at killing time. Love it on my kindle fire! highly recommend this app. its good for the whole family.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B0097EWK3A 5 1349049600 21 I couldn't stop playing this game. loved it. thank goodness the hint button was unlimited.  sometimes I forgot were things where.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B00J06HWC4 5 1399161600 43 Love lovE love this game. Doesn't take to long to Level up, and I like the graphics. Even the in app purchases are more bang for your buck. Just watch out for the perverted and horny people in the chat, lol. No seriously.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B005ZFOOE8 5 1379548800 28 Love, love, love, this app. Being stationed overseas it connects me to home, by listening to the station's from home. I have had no problems with the app
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B00G9EZ448 4 1384819200 29 Love the game, the only glitch I saw was the connection to facebook. It does not. But I do love how facebook is not required to play like most.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B00DRHY8EW 5 1381363200 43 This game well deserves more than 5 stars. It was engaging well thought out and complex without being too hard. It makes you have to remember a lot but that is what made the game fun for me. Looking forward to part 2.
A14O7U3IU7WRMB B007PW1BRC 3 1334102400 25 I don't like starting in the middle of the game, but for it to be a free app there really isn't much to complain about.
A14O8CYWKBEGHM B008MEM24S 5 1346284800 22 This game is great for children and adults who like WMW. I know my daughter likes it! Best game of the century.
A14O8CYWKBEGHM B008Y7SMQU 5 1346630400 31 this is the best logo quiz game because it gives you the easy logos first then the harder as you get toward level 4. it has logos like facebook and fiat.
A14OBYVK0MT3IG B004UIBIHM 5 1386115200 380 I don't know how some of these people came to the conclusions they did on some of these reviews. Most of the complaints are inaccurate (unless the app was updated and changed the features). You can add exact cents and new categories and you can edit entries already made. I love it as it helps me keep my math correct, plus I can put in automatic deductions and deposits. You can also do backups and then restore it if you lose your info. Glad I got it. Also, you can add more than 120 entries. It tells you to enter 0 to have unlimited entries. Nice App. I just reconciled my checkbook and it came out perfect since now I don't misread my own writing end up with the wrong figure. :-)An update: Just wanted to add to my review. I just accidentally took this app off my device. It restored beautifully and seems to do auto saves every so often so I only had to add a day of entries. Maybe when I accidentally removed it from my app, it did a backup before it deleted it, I am not sure.  Just know that there were some backup dates there that I didn't do manually.  The only thing I do not like is the white background around the checkbook. On my kindle fire hd, the background is black so it stands out as a white square around the checkbook and is not pleasant to the eyes. Perhaps they should have added a pretty colored background - a background that can be used regardless of the background color of your device and more pleasing to the eyes. I got rid of some apps because of this. Just can't stand the appearance. But I love this app so I guess I will have to endure it.  By the way, you do not have to be on the internet to use this, and it doesn't ask for account numbers, etc.  Just a good way to double check your math. I always back it up with a physical check register so I have one for my income taxes, etc., but I always check to make sure the balances match, and it has helped me to prevent errors in my physical checkbook. Great app!
A14OBYVK0MT3IG B0055S348W 5 1386115200 318 I have been wanting an app for my kindle fire hd for quite a while. I read the reviews on this app and didn't want to spend $12.95 if it wasn't going to do what I wanted. However, when it went on sale for $4.95, I thought that I would take a chance. It works perfectly with my mobile bluetooth printer as well as as my regular e-printer. Setup was really easy. They have you download updated drivers and something else to be able to print documents and then you just scan for the printer and then select it and when you tap on a document, a window will come up for you to choose which program you want to use to open it. You pick printershare and it is ready to print once you click on print. Works great. Can print from websites, too. Glad I took the chance. It is back to $12.95 now.An Update:  Still love this app.  I have had a couple of updates lately and the only thing that is an inconvenience is you have to download the document file again to print documents.  When you click on a document, and then the PrinterShare icon, it instructs you to download something in order to print the documents.  Never have to do it again until an update, then you have to repeat the process.  Wish it would stay installed so you didn't have to repeat doing it after each update.  Keep finding out new ways to use this.  If you want to print a web page, click on 'share' and then click on the PrinterShare Mobile icon.  Works great.  And I can print my e-mails if I go to the hotmail or yahoo website and print from there instead of from my e-mail app on my kindle (you can't print from there).  Overall, it is a great app and I would highly recommend it!
A14OBYVK0MT3IG B008VAGGWM 5 1385942400 23 I thought this game was really fun and some were really challenging. I thought it was fun and would recommend it to others.
A14OBYVK0MT3IG B007T8BYWE 5 1396742400 33 Love all the FlipPix games.  It is a mental game and I like that. Don't appreciate them making you give a review to proceed with the game, though. Do like the game, though.
A14OBYVK0MT3IG B0073G5PU4 5 1360108800 94 I love this app. It does exactly what I want it to do. It is the only calendar program that I could find where I could write in my appointments, etc. , which I prefer.  If some commitment goes for a couple of days, I can just draw a line through the days and not have to keep writing information in each day.  In the beginning I had some problems with it crashing on me, but they updated it and I re-installed it and I have not had any problems since. I love it.
A14OC5Q7XXIVFM B0069G5Z9K 5 1397520000 65 I like to play this game as a time killer .I like the different items you can get through out the game . I tend to be on the cheep side .So i like the fact I don't have to drop tons of cash to play this game .Also the different achievements you can get are lots of fun too.Like high five 75 scientist .
A14OC5Q7XXIVFM B00GINENG0 3 1399852800 106 I'm not big on Tom .On the other hand my kids love playing with him.Which would not be so bad if after every minute a new ad didn't pop up.Some of the ads cause the kindle to crash or freeze up .Which means reboot. I highly recommend you don't buy anything on this app.If your kids are using this make sure you have parental setting in place .Other wise Tom may cost you some of your hard earned cash!!!Other wise Tom is fun and funny when your not being pestered by Flow from progressive , The guys that brought you candy crush and some Many others!!!!!
A14OCTCB3H5IEN B00DOIBYYG 2 1381363200 34 I don't think it is the best thing ever ......but if you enjoy your kindle freezing then it's fantastic......the app would freeze then your kindle froze it was awful.....don't get I repeat DON'T GET!!!!!!!
A14OCTCB3H5IEN B00A8ECU24 5 1388880000 31 This app is perfect for mlp fans. It gives you fun tasks and it is fun for all ages. It also is a great way to pass time.I LOOOOOOOOVE this app!
A14OCTCB3H5IEN B004UID2LC 4 1393200000 35 I really enjoy this app although I must say that sometimes it doesn't load for me. The adds also cut off part of the top of the video. Other wise i quite enjoy this app.
A14OFECG10GT8U B00A4O6NMG 4 1371600000 50 I love this 'game' (more of entertainment) I would have given it 5 stars, but it is sooooo addicting! I get started and loose track of the time! It is fun and well worth the price. Just know, you've been warned! (Set the timer or have a clock handy) :-)
A14OFECG10GT8U B007SYAXIK 5 1353196800 39 Got this game as a free of the day app. Not too bad. Kept me busy and interested. Music is a liitle annoying, but that can be turned down or off. Not a bad game. I would recommend it.
A14OHTBCQUIRR9 B00A0XOT68 5 1352678400 20 love this game!! tons of fun, and it's totally free!!! very addicting. love it! entertains everybody too, even little kids.
A14OHTBCQUIRR9 B00A3E2BVE 5 1354320000 27 so stoked when i saw the app store finally had this! it's a great game and i've not encountered any bugs with it. get it. right now.
A14OHTBCQUIRR9 B00DJFIMW6 5 1385596800 25 probably one of the best apps out there. my 5 yearold nephew loves to play. with each update it just gets better. download. download now.
A14OJKRAUW9UHE B005YIPHL0 5 1367798400 34 as you read these prayer it awaken the real you the. spirit man and reminds us that the greater one resides in you and me all we must do is yeild to his leading

A14OKOZW0PDTAD B005DSLRDS 3 1364342400 32 This is an okay, fun, time waster app. A few NSFW clips, a few bad quality ones, some pretty good ones though too. Seem to run kind of slow on my tablet.
A14OKOZW0PDTAD B00A2RZDZI 5 1359331200 26 Star Wars fan here, saw the original movies in the theater starting back in 1977. This app takes angry birds to a different level. Very fun.
A14OKOZW0PDTAD B004MC8CA2 5 1359331200 30 An easy way to be able to read the Bible and have it with you. Nice for church and ouor church has used some of the apps features for services.
A14OKOZW0PDTAD B008TY8PKG 4 1359331200 21 A fun time waster, especially if you like Phineas and Ferb and Perry the platypus and his alter ego Agent P
A14OKOZW0PDTAD B004SJ3AXI 5 1359331200 20 It's another installment of the Angry Birds series, not much more to say other than fun fun fun fun fun

A14OOO44WA45E9 B008KPB8P8 2 1384473600 21 having difficulty accessing it on my Kindle Fire.  I even deleted it and reinstalled it, but to no avail.  Thank you.
A14OOO44WA45E9 B00GGQLZUG 4 1390867200 30 slot bonanza is fun.  Don't always lose, don't always win, but have fun doing it.  4 game fronts with it, so you have a different screen if you want.  Thanks
A14OOSVDYDQNXI B00GWJQVVA 3 1402185600 28 I rated it a three star because I think u should have the animals for free and some of the people free but the rest should be blocked.
A14OQ6PI8VYQ8M B005EIRU6U 4 1348185600 20 This is an entertaining game and easy to play. Reminded me of when we played this as kids. Would recommend.
A14OQ6PI8VYQ8M B00D6SBOWG 4 1403308800 35 This is a fun game and enjoy playing.  My only issue is that it takes up so much space MB that I have had to remove some of my other apps in order to play.
A14OQ6PI8VYQ8M B00CJ77HU8 4 1369872000 41 This game is quite fun - moves a little too fast at times but I am assuming that is what it is supposed to do.  I enjoy trying to capture the most points by placing the symbols in the right spot.
A14OQ6PI8VYQ8M B008Y2FRFO 3 1352246400 47 This game is fun when you are just sitting around and need something to do.  I will not buy more coins.  I don't like the fact you have to wait several hours to play again after you have used all of your coins.  Otherwise it is fun.
A14OQN8YR0VIDY B004LZIZHU 3 1341360000 54 This is a fun game and I would give it 5 stars except while u are playing it it forces close. :( So as I'm trying 2 level up it forces close in the middle of it an I have to start all over again!:( PLEASE FIX!!! Then I will give it 5 stars.

A14OUM7F51ITOG B004SRNH10 5 1314835200 219 What company in their right mind wants to pay multiple times to have their apps developed on multiple native platforms. When they can write their sin Flex/Flash once and have them run on all the platforms. Let Adobe do the work of figuring out all the differences between platforms. If you want to do multiple native platforms right, you would want expert developers for each platform doing the work, so you would have to hire different developers for each platform like Web, iOS, Android, WebOS, Blackberry, Mac and Windows, just to name a few.A well written flash app is as good as any native app. And a crappy written native app is as bad as any crappy written flash app.Flash and Air work great on my Evo 4G and Samsung Galaxy TAB, but seems a bit sluggish on my Xoom, but did get better with a resent update. I have confidence that Adobe with eventually completely fix the sluggishness.I've been a developer for many years on many different platforms and the Flex/Flash IDE's along with the other Adobe products that come with the CS5.5 Suites are the best set of tools I've ever used for developing apps and creating the artwork, ads, manuals, etc...BTW:Before giving a bad review READ THE DESCRIPTION, it states which phones are not compatible yet!
A14OUM7F51ITOG B004UMMWVY 1 1305072000 29 I had to add my 1 star to this app. Maybe the developer will take a hint, and charge a reasonable price for such a simple app. Like FREE!
A14OV138QUD9W6 B00E5GJ7QS 5 1383091200 17 Great gameLove the colors different cardsThis bingo is good for every one.works great on kindle hdVery addictive
A14OV138QUD9W6 B007TO3JW6 5 1356998400 22 Fun to play wish had more money so could play longer and not have to use real money in order to play
A14OV138QUD9W6 B00CMF27DE 5 1368576000 23 Loved this game.  Totally enjoy playing could spend hours playingLoved the bright colors and cute cats.  Maybe they can do one with dogs..
A14OVD77IDYX1I B00D3ULE1I 2 1373500800 20 You will find that it is not the best buy and. Can find better games out there. So good luck.
A14OVD77IDYX1I B00H7Y9CKG 4 1395964800 29 When I started playing I had fun from the start. I like the way you can breed the dragons. So if you get started just remember to have fun.
A14OVD77IDYX1I B00BWBHIUG 3 1387497600 27 I know that this game was meant for kids,but I am having a great time. I would rate it higher,but for the fact it has a limit.
A14OVD77IDYX1I B00FAPF5U0 5 1388793600 23 I was so glad I can now play it. When first I got it, I couldn't put it down. I just love it.
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B0092S4WLY 5 1377907200 23 A great way to challenge yourself and waste some time. Sometimes frustrating but always enjoyable. I would recommend this game to my friends
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B00EDEMLTW 5 1381276800 40 This is similar to other match 3 games except it gives you goals to meet that get harder and harder. So far it hasn't been so hard that I am frustrated so I continue to have fun. Well worth downloading.
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B008GU42KK 5 1393027200 37 I had fun with this but had some trouble sometimes figuring out what I was supposed to do in tight spots. A few more instructions would have been nice. But I would buy more from this company.
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B00AEJM6H2 5 1380672000 45 I had a great time wasting time playing this. It isn't too hard doesn't run out the timer too quick and would be good for all ages. I think the hints come up a little too quickly but that's a minor problem. Would definitely recommend.
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B009RLG7RI 5 1396656000 45 I paid for this game and really enjoy it especially the music that plays. It is different in the different villages. The graphics are nice and the game changes depending on which hero you choose to help you. I would download it as the FAOTD.
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B00IAQ3RJM 5 1401321600 25 I like match 3 games the at give you set challenges. You can play as a guest and not integrate with Facebook. A fun game.
A14OVTDU6CLZG0 B00CWY76CC 5 1377820800 21 Challenging but not impossible. Easy to get caught up in winning. Great way to spend some free time. I would recommend.
A14OXURKH929QJ B0055DUUDE 1 1308960000 20 On my LG G2X, it never gets past the title screen.Given that, a 20 word review is hard to do.
A14P2IJP5WQNZU B004KU5LHS 5 1377561600 35 Love this app. Works great and is only off by a day or two but I have only had it for a few months and it gets more accurate the more info I input (:
A14P2IJP5WQNZU B0054JZC6E 4 1381968000 33 This app has a ton of little games. Each set has its own games which cost a certain amount of coins to unlock which you earn from playing the unlocked games. Pretty fun.
A14P2IJP5WQNZU B00E1GFH2U 3 1383436800 22 The games are fun and unique but you can play each one only once every certain amount of minutes. A bit annoying.
A14P2IJP5WQNZU B00CRLSN4U 3 1382572800 41 Fun concept,  but if you get stuck on one and you don't have coins you get nowhere. It does have a handy Share on Facebook type button that allows you to get help from your friends. This is the saving grace
A14P2IJP5WQNZU B00EDEMLTW 4 1378425600 126 I downloaded this app because it keptpopping up as an ad on Bubble World's. I was immediately sucked in and am currently in the third world. The levels get very challenging so it is easy to be stuck on one level for quite some time but that's part of the fun in my opinion. The only thing I would suggest is the inclusion of optional power ups. They would be bought with points or stars you win for successfully completing levels and would make the most difficult levels a bit more doable. Other than that, awesome game, great graphics, music is pleasant, and overall very gratifying app.Update November 11, 2013:I have beaten the game twice now and am playing a third time. There isn't anything comparable!!
A14P2IJP5WQNZU B007VUA7VO 5 1357257600 55 This app works just like it says it should. I am very pleased with it and I really like all the little features that let you know approximately how much time I can use different features with the battery life left. It even lets you know how long it has been since the last charge.
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B006D1ONE4 5 1325289600 25 I Love this game!! I got it on free app of the day recently however I would have paid for it.  Swampy is so cute!!!
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B006OBWGHO 4 1326067200 24 I Love This deliteful game and trying to take of his needs I enjoy how simple it is to play in my Kindle Fire!
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B0079PXROU 5 1330041600 81 If you are like me and don't know or care about all the bells and whistles of other complicated programs available, then this program is for YOU!!!  It just tells you your battery percentage and estimated time left on the battery. I like how it puts this info right into the ongoing task bar. NO wading through mundane inform. Hanks to the developer for such a simple app. Now I use it and I can get the info quickly and fast.
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B0066T8M1I 4 1325030400 30 I just started this game on my Kindle Fire and have had no problems with it, EXCEPT I can't seem to change the house rules!! Very aadictive and fun, though!!
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B00658U5HE 5 1326326400 30 I just ABSOLUTELY love this battery app.  It shows the User how much battery is left before recharging....all at a glance in the notification bar!!  A MUST HAVE BATTERY APP!!
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B006MYTHH0 4 1328054400 61 I love Amazon and most of their free apps of the day...at least they are generous enough to offer this everyday!! People can be so picky over EVERYTHING!! I love games and realize nobody is perfect. This game is totally enjoyable and people should appreciate whatever generosity they can get. Or design their own game and see how easy it is.
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B0066T8SDU 5 1334793600 48 I am a new player to this game and. So far I love it. I have found no problems so far. The music could be louder but I think that is a Kindle Fire issue as other programs could be louder. I totally reccomend this game for anyone!!
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B006XIR9KM 5 1334880000 52 I really enjoyed this game!! I love any kind of memory game and I must admit this one is one of a kind.  I love the smooth and colorful tiles and with how they are moving all around to keep you on your toes.  Highly recommend this game! played on Kindle Fire.
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B0060I3IJG 5 1328918400 26 I love this app as you can stumble upon anything and get lost for hours. I highly recommend this to people who love browsing the internet
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B0067Q42BY 5 1329609600 51 First off, this works perfect on the Kindle Fire. Secondly, I found ONLY ONE PAGE OF ADS THAT I WOULD CALL THE START SCREEN on other PAID games and software apps that I have used before. This is a wonderful game that I highly recommend. Don't discriminate on such trivial grounds!!!!!!
A14P5K10BQ9HFJ B004F1S6A6 5 1322784000 21 Than you for such a nice program.  It really fills All my needs with no problems. I would recommend to others.
A14P6S127W4BS B007MFDUP8 3 1346630400 24 there are a lot of people who ask for single people and some people just to talk on the guess thing but its fun
A14P6S127W4BS B007PTJOV0 5 1342656000 37 I think it is a fun cheap version Mario game because of the bugs are like the turtles but I like how smooth it runs and jumps it is great for the soft screen of kindle fire!!!!!!
A14P6S127W4BS B008MEM24S 5 1345334400 22 I have a kindle fire. me and my freinds cant get enough its perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is awesome I recomend. buying this :D
A14P6S127W4BS B0086700CM 4 1345852800 33 its fun and adicting but it has thoose moments where you start some where and end up in another place you know and its really statical and choppy but ya it is fun!!!!
A14P6S127W4BS B007BPFIE0 1 1351382400 25 ok this is like taking care of teenage baby do not get this unless you don't have life. SERIOUSLY DO NOT: DO NOT: DO NOT
A14P6S127W4BS B0097M6WDG 5 1351382400 25 I think it is funny its the same controls as temple run though so I recommend it. :) Get it and try it your self!
A14P8L979R9SWD B0091REZMW 5 1364515200 36 this game is so much fun. great for a rainy day. the one thing I dont care too much for is how hard it is to get more diamonds after you have used the initial amount.
A14P8L979R9SWD B009UX2YAC 5 1387756800 23 this game is the most awesome game in the wourld so awesome that I cant stop playing ever I play this all night
A14P8L979R9SWD B008JJS6D2 4 1367625600 22 I really like this game except for it starts to get really slow and cant figure out how to turn in collections.
A14PM3ONHBEHVG B00CO6TOBY 5 1378339200 20 Love this game.it's relaxing and fun to play. The more you play, you figure out techniques to make more levels.
A14PM3ONHBEHVG B00CRHF748 4 1390176000 34 It's fun, and if there were more free puzzles it would be better. The app said free then when you open it, you only get a few free puzzles and have to purchase more.
A14PM3ONHBEHVG B00E46D1QQ 1 1378339200 20 I didn't really give this game a chance and just deleted it. Don't use this as a true opinion. Sorry
A14PM3ONHBEHVG B00DQ8APIK 4 1379376000 20 This game was fun. I didn't realize how many brands are out there that I recognized. It's a fun game.
A14PM3ONHBEHVG B00AEJM6H2 5 1375401600 22 This game is so much fun.  It's easy to play, but it's good at making you think.  It's easy to play anywhere.
A14PM6RRXRT0D B00BWBHIUG 4 1372636800 48 It's a relaxing game that only takes a few minutes to play if that's all the time you have. however , I wish you didn't have to connect to the Internet in order to play. Right now it won't connect to the server so it can't be played.
A14PM6RRXRT0D B00FAPF5U0 5 1388361600 21 Love this game. No problems and it's fun!  I find it a relaxing diversion when I'm waiting or just sitting around.
A14PM6RRXRT0D B006OOHVVC 5 1348617600 20 This game doesn't take long to play and it is just challenging enough to make you think without being frustrating.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B0050D6PH4 4 1311724800 30 The graphics are attractive and the look and feel of popping the bubbles is very pleasant. This is a great game for when you have a few moments to fill.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B004L07KWQ 5 1320192000 29 My 3 y.o. enjoys playing with this and the ability to save and share the photos online is a nice extra. The pictures it makes are aesthetically very pleasing.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B00685VI98 5 1322956800 173 This is a creative fun puzzle game which has been well implemented. I love it that there is no time pressure, so I am able to relax and enjoy it. Each puzzle has a shape, a number of lines to use, and a number of pieces to cut the shape into where each piece should be the same size. There's no one right answer, you can create your own solution each time, and once you're done it shows you the proportions of the area of each piece you made as a percentage so you can see how to improve it. At the end of each puzzle you can choose to try that one again or move on to the next. You can also see a grid of all of the puzzles you've already done with what score you got on each one, and from there you can choose to do one again. There are hints available if you get stuck. The controls are easy to use. This is one of my all-time favorites.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B004WPG1A2 5 1322870400 20 The shift concept is a clever idea and adds interest and challenge in visualizing a plan to navigate each puzzle.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B004DLPXAO 5 1320192000 58 I don't often have my kindle with me when I make quick runs out to the school for example. I almost always have my phone with me. This is very convenient for that reason. I also find it easier to read in bed with a small phone that fits in my hand and has it's own low light.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B004YEJGEO 4 1319760000 63 This game is fun and aesthetically pleasing. I can play it in little bursts because it's not against the clock or requiring constant attention. I wish the instructions were easier to get to. They happen as you go along but I found it a little confusing at first. A menu items with some basic instructions would have increased my enjoyment at the beginning.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B0058VW36U 5 1322870400 29 This puzzle game is a lot of fun and aesthetically pleasing. Om nom looks so happy and cute when it eats the candy it makes me smile. Highly recommend.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B004Z9Y3VY 4 1320192000 34 This is a lot of fun. It's not something you'd run through more than once of course, but you can always hand your phone to someone else and have fun watching them play it.
A14PRKDGZDT8JS B004DPC5Y2 5 1319760000 22 I bought this May 2011 and my 3.y.o twins still love it and ask to play it all the time. Great game!
A14PRSBSL1KBL9 B008KPB8P8 4 1383004800 29 Only reason I dnt give it 5 stars is because live stream is not in all areas. I live in Tucson & no Live Stream??!!! Come on ABC really.
A14PRSBSL1KBL9 B00CW6DAKC 3 1386115200 48 I ENJOY THIS GAME, BUT I CAN NEVER SYNC W/FB! So Im left w/10 neighbors since it refuses to connect w/FB. I have followed the trouble shoot instruction on 2 different occasions &amp; still doesnt connect. I lose out on asking for help. Fix &amp; would be 5stars.
A14PRSBSL1KBL9 B009PCBEPE 3 1384128000 21 I enjoy the game but it crashes often &amp; has to restart. If this was fixed I would give 5 star's.
A14PRSBSL1KBL9 B0093QQAEM 3 1386460800 29 I HAVE NO PROBLEM W/ oldies some are pretty good &amp; some better than the stuff out now. For .99 cents who care s if some have never heardcof.
A14PRSBSL1KBL9 B00EJILIPA 1 1383004800 86 It is NOT FREE you have a very very limited free example of game & it asks for 4.99 several times before allowing free time. Dont waste time downloading game. Looking for clues I will say is well hidden. so either buy the game straight out or pass it by.If it was a .99 or 2.99 I would buy it but 4.99 is way to much for this game. I will delete game & watch for price to drop or become free app of the day.
A14PRSBSL1KBL9 B00FAPF5U0 5 1383004800 44 I LOVE CC! I have it in my Fire, on my Android & Laptop. Only thing Idnt like is it doesnt always sync w/FB. You can only use item you &#34;buy&#34; on the devise if you want boosters. They dnt carry over in inventory.
A14PTALHHO9NQL B00E7VV2RS 5 1382313600 28 Fun to have and play . I like it because there people two kill . This batter then those blood games and good two players assault and battery

A14PZ2M3C3N0BK B00HEJZ1KO 4 1391385600 44 its good to download songs and listen but hey there is no way to put them together I'm in shower trying to listen to music and its just the same song over and over I know have memerized all the songs I have :/
A14PZ2M3C3N0BK B00I8Q77Y0 4 1392076800 25 I like kinds like flappy bird.but when I touch it the screen just bounces the bird id hard to control and I little bit trippy
A14Q1RITX3E2PB B00BFUUMO8 5 1364515200 23 This is a fun game.... I have played it now for three days, but I can see it getting boring soon. Have fun...
A14Q1TFKYU8YCK B00I8Q77Y0 5 1392336000 21 this game is FUN but ADDICTING... its really like the original Flappy Bird game but more fun because... it drops POOP!!!

A14Q1TFKYU8YCK B008Y0REKC 5 1390176000 20 Its a good way to practice responsibility and kind of a good way to practice taking care of a pet!
A14Q30U55W69V1 B00GNIJAEA 5 1401494400 52 It's really fun to be able to put yourself in a cartoon with friends! I'd like to see more options for creating a look-alike avatar, and options to put more than 2 people in each cartoon, but it's still really fun! Has worked great on my Kindle Fire first gen...  GET BITSTRIPS!
A14Q30U55W69V1 B0058EBNAO 4 1375315200 72 ...Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;...It seems to work well, and also has been pretty pretty accurate.  I DO wish that there was an easily-accessible legend with solid definitions for the symbols.  Maybe there is, and I just don't know where to find it.  Anyway, a good purchase, and I feel good about recommending it!  It's been alerting me to &#34;Coastal Flood&#34; & &#34;Flash Flood&#34; warnings&#34; for days... oh, and the warnings are correct!
A14Q30U55W69V1 B006HJKKCG 5 1360368000 57 I haven't had a reason to use this app to communicate with anyone, but I've played around with it, and it seems to work well...at least as far as I can tell.  Since I only speak English, I can't really guarantee that it's giving me the words I need, but it seems to do a good job...
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00FWPWNKS 5 1388707200 22 LOVE  IT LOVED ONE LOVE TWO SO MUCH FUN CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW IT ENDS UP.. JUST STARTED BUT LOVE IT
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00DLJ31HQ 5 1373241600 23 This game is great. You can guess the pics without moving the pieces. It's quick and easy and it is for all ages.
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00DWZ3S90 4 1395964800 30 I think this would be a great game for kids. Some grownups might like it, but I am bored with it. It is like a candy crush saga for children.
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B005HSL626 5 1359331200 23 I love this game, the graphics are great and the arcade part it so much fun. I just want to play every day.
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00GTGSEW0 5 1388707200 20 JUST STARTED IT BUT I AM ENJOYING IT ALOT, HAVING SO MUCH FUN LOVE IT MORE THAN CANDY CRUSH YEAH
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B007CK1MEY 4 1359331200 29 I love the different themes, I just wish i had more themes without having to pay for them, but the the three you get for free are very entertaining.
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00JTKDTLE 5 1401408000 29 I really like this app. I have so much fun and it is truly addictive. I find myself losing all sense of time when I am playing this game.
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B008XG1X18 5 1382140800 22 I love having a computer board  where I can post  my ideas and pics of things I love and everyone see it
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00IF2JW8G 2 1395273600 30 I didn't understand what was going on and when you first get in the game they want you to pay right away. I just didn't get the game at all.
A14Q41WH6VGGLH B00514DIE0 5 1359331200 30 if you are a Mahjong player you are going to love this one. as you finish one level you have so many more to go and  I just love it.
A14Q4XSI2LRIY0 B00H1TX87A 5 1396828800 23 Love these games! Thanks to the makers for another challenging puzzle to escape. My family all get involved when mom (me) gets stuck.
A14Q4XSI2LRIY0 B0092S4WLY 5 1373328000 26 My family loved 100 floors and have enjoyed all of the Escape apps as well. It is tun for us to all work together to escape.
A14Q4XWN72OPTX B006OC2ANS 5 1331078400 20 cool graphics and skill development but doesn't get deeper. Of course there's pressure to pay real money for better stuff.
A14Q4XWN72OPTX B0055SWM08 5 1316390400 24 Simple special puzzles that offer fresh challenges against a backdrop that makes you forget how long you've been playing. The name makes sense now.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B004HGK6FW 5 1328313600 59 I really enjoy this app.  I have never had problems with it, the puzzles are challenging, and it is easy to use.  I especially like the new digit enter keys.  It took a bit of adjusting but it is a definite improvement over the old format.  Best of all, it is calming and helps me fall asleep at night.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B00A8ECU24 3 1401926400 89 This game is fun and really nails the essence of mlp:fim. The biggest blight is the desperate demands for money. It is almost impossible to get over half the characters and shops without spending real money, and the constant ads popping up to shill the creepy equestria girls dolls are equally frustrating. I can't tell you what to do to make the game currency purchasing good, but I know when it works. This one doesn't. Making a game fun only if you spend money is a bad business move.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B00AZL3PBK 1 1361145600 21 Terrible game. Waste of time. Good thing it was free or I'd feel ripped off. Yes, this game was THAT bad.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B00BWBHIUG 4 1368403200 94 The graphics are lovely, the music is soothing, and the game is very simple. Microtransactions are &quot;encouraged&quot; by the game in the form of quests that require pearls-a currency that can be bought (or harvested, but only one every 3 days). As yet I have not been forced to stop because of these requirements but that may change. It also requires an internet connection, which, if you have the first-gen kindle fire, can be easier said than done. Overall, this game is fun, informative, beautiful, and overall very enjoyable despite its few negative points.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B008JGSM6G 5 1344384000 24 Very easy to pick up and play anywhere.  just enough challenge to keep it interesting, but easy enough that you won't quit in frustration.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B0066T8OH0 1 1351728000 23 I was very disappointed to hear the terrible music they used to abuse our earholes. I wish the original music was an option.
A14Q9WYLHQ0Y70 B007PW1BRC 1 1334102400 28 I would rather suffer an ad constantly and be able to play this card game properly than have the app show me a couple random phases of gameplay.
A14QA7Z2U5DGA4 B00FHYX6O6 5 1405900800 33 great game I say so myself when I first played it yesterday it's kind of funny cuz the game quality said crap but idc it's awesome always play it and tryout the sandbox
A14QA7Z2U5DGA4 B00992CF6W 5 1356652800 28 Pc so buy it its so good on my world I have goldSo doneThis game is awesome you guys should buy I play it on the kindle and
A14QA7Z2U5DGA4 B00KWVZ750 5 1405900800 73 Awesome game when I first played this game I was exited im at the ship parts so it was 29 days ago and I started off with red which in this game is a knight so than u unlock chuck which is like a wizard it's fun when u unlock bomb so I unlock the girl than bomb and now I'm trying to unlock the 3 blue birds!!!!! Recommend to 6 and older
A14QG7D4J2M4DA B00E5GJ7QS 4 1399507200 24 I really like the fact that you get rewarded even if you don't bingo.  Many other bingo games, you don't get rewards every game.
A14QG7D4J2M4DA B009KS4XRO 4 1377129600 34 I really enjoy playing, but feel that more people would play if we could play for free more than once a day, and if the payouts were better.  Thank you for the free gamesites.
A14QG7D4J2M4DA B00AMEFZ72 4 1392249600 28 Fast paced!  You can play slot while playing bingo. You also advance levels fairly quick. Only negative is once people bingo, you can't see the bingo board anymore.
A14QGA3PK6JDVY B0064TVQ5E 5 1358726400 39 I'm a long time Mah Jongg player! I love this app! I can play for a few minutes when I'm on my lunch, waiting for friends, waiting for an oil change etc.  I have recomended it to several friends!
A14QGA3PK6JDVY B006VXRNYG 5 1358726400 29 I downloaded this for my 2 year old great grand son. He loves it! I have suggested it to many of my friends for their children and grand children!
A14QGA3PK6JDVY B007N5YIUS 5 1358726400 34 My daughter and grand daughter have Angry Birds so they suggested I download it. It's relaxing to sit and play when I have some down time. Something to take the mind off your day
A14QH2WM04QPH9 B00BNH1PF8 5 1363824000 36 I I I I I i I iI ii. I i ii iKiri iiiiootoiiiii.  I I I I i i iiii I iii I ii I I I I t. ii I I I I I
A14QH2WM04QPH9 B009SDHIPK 3 1357084800 21 the offense sucks if make a pass it makes ur wr run backwards and sometimes the quarterback doesn't throw the ball
A14QH2WM04QPH9 B00BMH4GQE 5 1363564800 22 goodbest dam. game ever I I I I I I I I I no no no no no non on I played
A14QI3ZUWY36QX B009ZZGX98 3 1357689600 22 Only gave this one an average rating as it's much easier than the on on my PC.  But it is still fun...
A14QI3ZUWY36QX B004K4RY9M 4 1364947200 34 I have always liked the wordsearch game and love this edition.  The only problem I have with it is to line the words out it is sometimes hard as the line will jump around
A14QI3ZUWY36QX B00FAPF5U0 5 1402531200 22 Again I play this on facebook on my computer.  It is a very fast moving game and I really enjoy the challenge.
A14QI3ZUWY36QX B0063M22QO 3 1364947200 21 Liked the regular Mahjong better.  This one is too easy....I have not really played this one enough to make anymore judgement
A14QI3ZUWY36QX B00B5KHZA2 4 1361836800 30 This game is both intriging and fun.  Keeps me satisfied for a long time.  If a person likes puzzles this is the game for them.  The scenes are absolutly beautiful.
A14QI3ZUWY36QX B007RDTICY 3 1402531200 25 Have only played it one time so far and it is just average in difficulty. It's much like the other Mahjon game I've already downloaded.
A14QJPBBZAWIF B009NF54ZE 4 1385251200 53 I like this game a lot.  Not too challenging but still makes you think. Love the variety of different games, never gets boring. Wish you could skip past the story lines if you want to, can take a while to get to next game. Over all I really like and enjoy this game.
A14QJPBBZAWIF B00A37XD90 5 1382832000 22 love this game. very additive. can't stop playing. would recommend. great graphics and sound. interesting story line. you've got to try it.
A14QJPBBZAWIF B00DJFIMW6 5 1378252800 22 My 11 year old loves this minion game, he steals my kindle often to play it. Thanks.. really :) I mean it.
A14QKN6ENDIK1Z B00CO6TOZA 5 1388361600 32 12 year old boy gave this game a five star rating.  Says it is fun and you can be very creative with it.  A lot of entertainment value for a free app.
A14QKN6ENDIK1Z B00BSW0M34 4 1364601600 28 11 year old likes the game. Doesn't want to do anything else at the moment, mesmerized by it. So now the 7 yo grandchild wants to play too.
A14QKN6ENDIK1Z B008Y2FRFO 5 1364601600 29 I can't believe I can I have actually won prizes playing this.  I am never able to at the fair.  Kids 11 & 7 think it is super cool.
A14QKPEEZDFAT3 B009UX2YAC 5 1361318400 24 the best game in the world gotta get it or you are a nobody and I mean a nobody so get it right now
A14QMZVNFWFIC B00AEJPK0C 4 1388448000 81 Jewels Legend is easier than Bejeweled because the combinations are easier to see and you just have to swipe the path of 3 or more to clear them from the board.  I liked the fact that you can also swipe through the lock and chain to include that space in your path.  The layouts on the higher levels are getting more challenging but so far I have managed to get at least one star on every board.  This game is addictive.
A14QMZVNFWFIC B00CJ77HU8 5 1386460800 57 Great game!  It is very challenging, colorful and you are playing against the clock which adds an element of excitement.  Only on the very first easiest puzzles did I get any 3 star ratings.  I usually sneak in under the wire for 1 star, but there are many, many puzzles so I will keep practicing with it.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B008655OVQ 5 1391990400 63 Because I can get most of my news from this site, I visit it often, sometimes several times a day. I learned about this from a retire naval officer because it also was his home page. I am a &#34;news junkie,&#34; and this is my first informational page of the morning before progressing to the others that I read (both &#34;left&#34; & &#34;right&#34;).
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B0066W1AZK 1 1401321600 39 Maybe I don't understand how to play chess electronically, but I could never figure out how to play it. I think I left it on my Kindle Fire HDX just as a challenge to try an figure it out.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B0062AX2DE 5 1401321600 94 With this app, you can have it just give you your daily reading. Whether or not one believes in Tarot I have found the daily card to be interesting. As in astrology, sometimes it applies, at other times, not. The app also gives you the opportunity to lean the about the tarot deck, which I also found interesting. When reading about this on Amazon, I was impressed by the reviews of professional tarot readers. I do not aspire to become one, but learning new things always draws me in. I find it quite interesting.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B007K8RFJ4 3 1391990400 61 I &#34;purchased&#34; this for free and really don't know how it is better than the remote. Perhaps I am just not used to using it.  I downloaded this based on others recommendation, but I either need to find out what the advantage is or delete it. It does work well but I guess it's all in what you are used to.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B007ZGO7EM 5 1391990400 24 I downloaded this for the times that I need to calc something out. It is very easy to use and basic, just what Iike.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B0063IH60K 3 1353801600 36 This is a typical Solitaire game, nothing much to comment on. I need to find a solitaire game that lets me chose which run I will play on. In the meantime I play this on occasion.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B0066T0BTO 3 1401321600 56 I used to be a fanatic of this game on my iPod touch, then put it on my KIndle Fire HD & HDX and have had a number of issues with it freezing up. I also find the graphics not as crisp as other games. Right now and for months I have instead enjoyed Dragon Gem.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B008D29K7G 5 1391990400 56 Next to Drudge this is one of my favorites because of the different subjects that Fox.com offers on their website. It covers the national, international, sports and Hollywood goings on. This is a daily site for me, although usually on my laptop. I put this on my tablet for times that I don't have my computer.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B00AEJM6H2 5 1391990400 80 Every time I lay down to rest or get ready for bed, this is what I do: play Jewels Star. It is a highly addictive game of getting three or more jewels in a row. The more jewels that you can line up in a limited time advances you to the next level. After you reach the last level, another game opens up. I have been playing this for a couple of years now and it keeps drawing me in.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B00CJ77HU8 5 1400976000 60 This is one of the most addictive games I have ever played. I usually move on to something else and go back later. This one however, I have been playing every chance that I get.I wish that I could move on to some reading that I've dowloaded, but this game is so challeging, I am always compelled to keep playing.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B009HQ9UHC 4 1353801600 83 This I find to be quite challenging because there aren't any understandable directions, so I need to kind of guess what I am supposed to do and what the goal is. Because of this, progress is slow, but intriguing. There is an illustrated book - nothing written - to be used as directions - can be used a hints, I guess. Because I am naturally a problem-solver, I find figuring this game out as part of the challenge. I find this game enjoyable.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B004LZIZHU 2 1391990400 33 Some people that I know really like it, but I didn't find it that great. I took it off of my tablet. There are other three or four-in-a-row that are better I thought.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B004SJ3BCI 5 1353801600 38 The best way to play this game is with one of the new stylus. It plays like all of the others and is a kick to play but frustrating to get 3 stars (my challenge) to move up.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B0066TUXU6 5 1391990400 81 I used to subscribe to Hulu+ and am now a dedicated user of Amazon Prime, so cut my subscription. I used to watch all of my movies on the Kindle Fire using this. I highly recommend this download. If you have a Kindle that takes the mini-HDMI you can get the cable that has that and the HDMI on the other end and plug it into your TV to stream right from your tablet to the TV. This works very good.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B0064TVQ5E 5 1353801600 30 I enjoyed this enough that I purchased it. The challenge is good and can be stopped and resumed at a later time which is nice while waiting for an appointment.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B006P2Y2QK 5 1353801600 50 This game can also play Las Vegas&#34; style - one run through the deck. I am looking for a solitaire where I can choose which run to put the card on if two runs are going. I have one on my iPod Touch that I prefer because of this feature.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B00850NK6I 5 1391990400 85 I have this and have used it to borrow books from my local library. I downloads books to your tablet. You &#34;check out&#34; books and after the lending time is done, it extracts the book from your tablet. No over-due books! I used it once, but have found other alternatives where I don't have to return the book in two weeks - Amazon Prime. I have found that I have so much going on that two weeks in not enough time to digest a book.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B005KC664W 5 1353801600 21 Very good game. I particularly like that it shows which numbers you have left to use. Would pay for this game.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B00AUXZJAS 5 1391990400 108 There are numerous games, for wont of another word where you can pick what you want to play. None of them take very long, a matter of a minute or two. Each game keeps points of how you are doing and you can compare that with the available ranges, to see how you compare. It is suggested that you do these on a day basis. Actually it is fun and doesn't need a brainy person to do it. From what I understand, though, each exercise does get more challenging. It appears that it provides the level that you do best so that you don't get discouraged and quit.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B006BDHAX0 5 1353801600 79 I purchased this after using the free one. As with anything after you try it - if you like it - buy it! There are progressions and personal completion time to be challenged if you like. I notice that there are three stars for each game. It appears that a game played a 7 minutes gets one star, so must be that fewer minutes earn more of them. The goal must be to get three stars for each game.
A14QRR7Q3ISTHB B006CQ8TC2 5 1353801600 48 This is a cute game! I got it as a free offer for Thanksgiving and have had a blast with it. I could not find any directions for it, so it's a learn-as-you-go, but this also means that you will improve your score with the more you learn!
A14QSBQKADIRGO B007ZGO7EM 5 1369008000 23 I needed a calculator and downloaded this one. It  works great. I have to write nine more words so hope this is enough.
A14QSBQKADIRGO B004XE06OY 5 1372809600 26 This is a free download of a commonly enjoyed game. You can select the level desired and it is a useful AP for a waiting room.
A14QSBQKADIRGO B0063GORYU 1 1404950400 39 anyone who has played Spider knows you need to be able to move more than one card at a time and not sure if it's this download or my device, but 1 at a time is all that works.
A14QSBQKADIRGO B0063IH60K 5 1400716800 20 An enjoyable game to while away waiting time anywhere you have your Kindle. You can't always win, but that's life.
A14QT8VLQFZYQV B00E5GJ7QS 5 1378425600 22 Fun easy to earn bingo bucks kind of hard to get bongos at first but gets very challenging and fun...keeps me occupied...
A14QT8VLQFZYQV B00BGC5UAG 5 1364428800 25 Fun game you guys did a great job...very challenging and takes up unused time...hope you have one where u can scramble letters for better clues...
A14QT8VLQFZYQV B00CMF27DE 5 1383264000 32 My kids love this game it's easy for them to play cause it spots the numbers n bingo for them...I love it too cause I love bingo...n cats cats cats cats cats...
A14QT8VLQFZYQV B00E8KLWB4 5 1379030400 22 Finally a hidden  object game I can rely on with out purchasing anything...awesome game...hours of fun manageable time...have fun people I am...
A14QT8VLQFZYQV B00AIQP9DE 5 1363564800 25 Good game takes up free time when there's nothing else to do.... plays awesome on my kindle fire hd and is very challenging at times.
A14QT8VLQFZYQV B007PT3QOQ 5 1373760000 35 Fun game and I love the graphics unused to love playing the Oregon trail in the third grade I remember r my teacher sister June let us play it at computer time for a hour....
A14QUX6S5GVQ44 B00C7X0ZNU 3 1383436800 102 That is about it. The slots are real, straight from the casino, but the payouts are the worst of any of the twenty or so slot games I have tried. I do better at the actual casino. Too bad...Update: I had to come back and add a star to my review.  I can no longer say I never win.  It is just rare, and some games are better than others.  Honestly, I would bump my review to four stars, but it is so hard to level up.  That becomes really frustrating to a player.  Still, this is a solid three star game.
A14QUX6S5GVQ44 B0081JPTXK 2 1368316800 35 Good - slot are mildly fun, a small amount of free coins every 4 hours, bonus games ok.Bad - You have to spend money to play all games, leveling up is slow, graphics just okay.
A14QUX6S5GVQ44 B008YOBYNG 4 1360713600 60 Would say 3.5 with a bit towards 4 stars. Good games, does not eat all your coins right away, and free coins every four hours. On the bad side, you are restricted in the amount of coins and lines you can play until you reach a high level. Also, bonus games are weak but I have played a lot worse.
A14QWVBK06PYKT B008OZTIK6 5 1353715200 24 This is perfect for my grandson. He is 4 and he really likes to play and learn at the same time with this game!
A14QWVBK06PYKT B008JGSM6G 5 1353715200 30 We all can play...so many different levels...it is fun and addicting.  Even my 4yr old grandson and 9 yr old granddaughter can play at their individual levels and have success.
A14QWVBK06PYKT B0087HEQ6M 4 1339113600 25 this street is cute but definitely way overcrowded. how about a moving van to move to another block? or maybe have a construction crew job?
A14QYMU8N9ZEMM B008V06NRU 3 1386806400 39 This app is fun at first then it just gets boring, like if u have more important things to do then take care of ur pou then it get sick and it takes forever to get it normal again.
A14QYMU8N9ZEMM B00I8Q77Y0 5 1391904000 26 this app is pretty cool i like how the tubes change colors and the birds..................that's pretty cool!!!!!  &lt;3 so other than that i think it cool.
A14QYMU8N9ZEMM B008K8VDPU 5 1384041600 21 coolest piano app u can ever get i love how it teaches u how to play many different song. soooo cool....
A14QZ9CN9UAHKJ B008D2QRAO 2 1360800000 34 I guess slots are not the thing for me anymore.  You play and play and never win, or when you win it's not worth it.  I prefer games that challenge my mind, hand/eye coordination.
A14QZ9CN9UAHKJ B0096YJDNQ 3 1394582400 36 Made me dizzy using it though.  I have a nexus 7.  I couldn't get it to settle on my sky, even with the settings right, but it looks good, despite the issues I had with it.
A14QZ9CN9UAHKJ B005FT0A8I 1 1357084800 29 I kept getting a popup error and could not play the game.  Unfortunately, I deleted it after loading and unloading it two times, both on line and off line.
A14R3L1JWSWRNX B00B4G3MV8 1 1386288000 90 Showtime will not let you view movies/series on Kindle Fire HD via an HDMI cable connection. I keep getting error messages asking me to unplug my HDMI cable. This is stupid considering HBO, STARZ, MoviePlex, Encore, Hulu, Netflix, Crackle, etc. does!  Lots of people travel and connect their tablets to the TV for viewing, there is no reason for Showtime to restrict viewing.  this may not be important to everyone but it is to me - tools. For this  I am also canceling my subscription until they allow the capability.
A14R3L1JWSWRNX B007K8RFJ4 5 1386288000 40 This app works so well with my Roku - I lost my remote and I don't care. If I find it, I don't think I will use it. Love the &#34;Play on Roku&#34; setting not found on the regular remote.
A14R6NSH6D3WGF B00BMK357W 5 1387238400 30 enlighten me of the game time spent I loose. how long I play next thing I know that the battery is in the very last of turning. out line red

A14RJE75S6XW09 B00F9ZO3Z4 4 1383350400 50 It is a bit frustrating that these games are advertised as free. They are not. The games chew up the free credits too fast and then you have to buy .more. The bonuses are fun and the stars are added up fast so you can advance to a new game.
A14RJE75S6XW09 B00AQR3QN0 3 1373500800 25 Not what I thought. It is not totally free as advertised.Confusing for young children and adults. When you say free,then that's what it should be.
A14RJE75S6XW09 B00CKG0A0C 3 1377734400 20 Points rack up quickly but the bonuses are boring. It is entertaining though but I would rather play something else.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B00CEVALHA 4 1402358400 41 I gave this four stars cause it's fun though it's a little confusion on some of the things in the game.  I would however recommend this game for older children or adults the younger kids it might be to much for.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B00DRPVE3M 5 1375920000 31 I started playing this game and have to make myself put it down.  Wishing the playing the game was free instead of costing those gold tokens.  Still though worth the buy.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B0085VR7WU 5 1376092800 29 I've been playing this for a while and enjoy it to know end.  The only thing that bothers me is it sometimes hangs.  Other than that highly recommend it.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B00ELV0WF2 5 1400112000 28 I can't put this down. A game that keeps you thinking and busy for hours.  Good for long road trips or doctor office or just any long waits.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B008RA3X5E 5 1365638400 38 I downloaded this and can't get get enough of using it.  The features are easy to use and the alarm wakes me up and I sleep deep.  Thanks for an app that will get its use twice over.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B00BJ4ETBW 5 1374019200 30 I played the free game and had to buy it.  This game is a great deal harder to do which makes it fun ans challenging.  I highly recommend this game.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B00G5LQ5MU 4 1388793600 24 I find it very challenging and fun.  I would recommend this game to everyone if you want to make yourself really have to think.
A14RKVPCZUNL7B B00AQMSJI2 5 1378252800 24 This game is enjoyable.  The only thing that bothers me is the way it's more like a puzzle trying to find places for buildings.
A14RM0I9F9FU8V B009G1J62C 2 1353542400 31 I did not enjoy the game, it is more like a shop class from highschool. Build the blocks so they don't break, and then do it again over and over. Boring...
A14RM0I9F9FU8V B00CKOYVG8 3 1368403200 60 Angry Birds has so evolved that is it difficult get into the more simple one. I believe this would be a much better starter game for those who are just beginning, but if you have been playing for some time, it does not carry quite as much apeal. A solid game, nonetheless I was not as enamored with the tactics.
A14RM0I9F9FU8V B007N5YIUS 4 1362873600 38 This is a fun game but the ads drive you crazy. For the price it would be better to get the paid version. Still overall if you do not mind advertizing, this is fun and mind boggling. :)
A14RM0I9F9FU8V B0081JPTXK 3 1353542400 34 I enjoy playing yet the time is all too short because much like a real casino the money goes too fast.The wins are often few and far between, so often the game is short.
A14RM0I9F9FU8V B004SJ3BCI 4 1336089600 106 A simple and yet highly addictive game, creative and full of laughs. The sounds and scenes are amazing and each of the progressive birds are amazing. You quickly find your favorites and the ones you realy prefer, then the program changes a bit and they are not quite as strong, or usueful for that particular round. The game certainly teaches you patience, in the beginning you can not move on until you have mastered the scene. It is fun and frivilous, and certainly seems innocuous, yet be aware, it will become very addictive in a short time. Something so simple, and yet so frustrating and fun.
A14RM0I9F9FU8V B004TTY694 4 1362873600 56 This is a great application and can be used in may ways, such as a note book for students, a place to jot thoughts for writers, and a great place to keep a list of medications for those who need it. Easily accessable, and safe, you can take your thoughts with you where ever you go.
A14ROUL33FLEY0 B0057J06HQ 1 1358553600 22 It looks good but it is not. Don't get this game please. It insults people Don't buy this please use time wisely.
A14ROUL33FLEY0 B00CRLSN4U 5 1375747200 20 Super awsome and amazing . wish that they were easier too do though.please make an easier vision. Thank you. Yea.
A14ROUL33FLEY0 B00B2WWEFE 5 1361232000 23 I think it looks like a good game. It  is taking forever to download. But I think it will be a good game.
A14ROUL33FLEY0 B00AREIAI8 5 1359331200 35 My HORSE is kind of boring. I wish it had more to do. But it still gets 5 star's. I got it because my sister has this game so I thought I would try it.
A14ROUL33FLEY0 B009HKL4B8 4 1388275200 24 This game is an OK game. I just wish u could send your sims to church. Please upgrade the game and make some modifications.
A14ROUL33FLEY0 B00I8Q77Y0 3 1392249600 24 THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING! If u like a challenge then u should get this game. I have only gotten 1 point,but it is ADDICTING.
A14RQLTDSX05QM B00G4NUQYM 3 1395792000 26 This is an interesting game. I am enjoying it. Makes you think hard. All don't make sense but it still seems like a good game overall.
A14RQLTDSX05QM B005HPIO88 2 1327363200 24 D for airplane? E for fire truck ... seriously? Learn your alphabets before developing an app... that too for kids...Even kids can catch this...
A14RQLTDSX05QM B00942X8PY 4 1364169600 20 This is an interesting game and for free so why not. Keeps you interested and engaged to play more. Addictive.
A14RQLTDSX05QM B009T8XBBO 5 1373241600 33 I have played this game on the computer before and loved it, I am glad I was able to get a tablet version and can play it all the time now. Thank You
A14RRYWTTUBTD7 B00FEMJF6O 5 1384732800 47 I played the original on Facebook so was very happy to see this version for my Kindle. I like the changes I've seen so far. It's still the same game at heart but it's something new! I haven't had any problems when playing it on my Fire.
A14RRYWTTUBTD7 B00AQF8CJ0 5 1379289600 28 A puzzle wrapped up with fun little creatures! Working out the solutions for each level is a challenge but it's always fun to make the pudding monster happy.
A14RRYWTTUBTD7 B00CEKIGGO 5 1379289600 49 I bought this game for my nephews to play because I thought it looked cute. It's too hard for them (2 &amp; 3 yrs old) but that doesn't matter because I'm addicted! I play this game every available moment of the day! Such a fun &quot;sims&quot; sort of game.
A14RTPF71VCIDO B009L9Z6G4 5 1354579200 43 I been a huge wresting fan since i was a kid so this is a wonderful app.I love sitting with my sons & reading to them about the fascinating legends of wrestling then they tell me about the cool ones out now :)
A14RTPF71VCIDO B009PSV1HE 5 1358726400 22 Im a long time fan of Diner Dash & this game did not dissapoint.Awesome levels & upgrades.Would deffinetly pay for this game.
A14RTPF71VCIDO B007PT3QOQ 4 1367107200 69 ..You run out of energy to do things around your town?! & everyone else stands around while you get your town going on your own.Theres so many things you can build but then you need to build the supplies to build what you need.Its alot of building without many reward other than being a good way to get you leveled up quickly.Atleast this game updates often & its free.
A14RTPF71VCIDO B007N5YIUS 4 1354579200 29 Angry Birds=Crack lol.The graphics on this one are so cool that it just made me smile from beginning to end that I was playing..plus,it shuts the kids up :D
A14RTPF71VCIDO B004SOR4H6 4 1354579200 25 Its a decent app that does what it says it does & im happy with it.Free,wonderful & awesomely looks good on my kindle fire HD.
A14RTPF71VCIDO B004SJ3AXI 5 1358726400 30 VERY COOL version & I love all the levels which makes me so happy because most free versions only give you a few levels but this gives you many.Awesome game!!
A14RTPF71VCIDO B0088QGB7Y 4 1366588800 26 My kids LOVE this game.My one complaint..you have to buy smurf berries to get the real good stuff-talk about creating money hungry youth.Other than that..Great game.
A14RTPF71VCIDO B007SYWFRM 4 1367107200 43 My kids love this game & all the creatures & their families you can get.The graphics are really smooth & adorably animated(The glacier & the rainbows are the best) also the audio too.If your family are fans of this franchise..get this game.SCRAT RULES!
A14RTPF71VCIDO B008MEM24S 5 1358726400 23 Awesome game,Deffinetly wouldve payed more for this one.My 4 & 6 year old LOVE it & I enjoy it also..& Im 30 Haha.
A14RTPF71VCIDO B0064T6LV8 4 1358726400 24 This game is cool.Its kinda tough to see but worth it.I wouldve liked more levels but am satisfied.It does what it says itll do.
A14RW6KQKI3M0J B007PW1BZY 5 1334361600 59 For those of you (like me) married to great people that hate PHASE 10 this a great app to buy. it was a little funny to learn the controls but once you get the hang of them it is tons o' fun. I suggest using a stylus to make card moves easier. best $0.99 app I bought so far.
A14RW6KQKI3M0J B004SBS8LA 1 1300752000 48 1.) Took forever to download. (I'm on high speed wifi network, not 3g) no biggy.2.) won't even go past the "ROVIO" screen. freezes then force closes.3.) that ain't cool. i had high hopes now...not so much.I am deleting both angry birds and the amazon app store.DE-REGISTERING MY DEVICE
A14RW6KQKI3M0J B0063IH60K 5 1330473600 22 easy and great. super super. cant say snuff gr8gr8 things about it. buy it and you will be. very pleased and happy
A14RW6KQKI3M0J B007XKEY6Q 3 1337990400 94 love the game but HATE THE ADS. after almost every move an ad pops up...now they are videos that you have to skip over to get back to the game. id rather pay for the app. stupid ads now hang up the game mores often and ask if id like to force close. please give an update to paid option. ads are the worst for the end user especially when its the same ad over and over...visits us on facebook....visit us on face book....yeah yeah we get it you are lonely and want friends.
A14RYXJCCVGUOF B00AU13VA0 5 1358294400 36 Beautiful graphics. Fun match 3 game. The mini games and build your own city rewards is a fun addition. And in relax mode there is no timer. You can lose a lot of time playing this.
A14RYXJCCVGUOF B009T8XBBO 4 1358294400 89 First off,I love this game! I first started playing this game on my iPad. I then bought My Kingdom for the Princess III which I found plays fine on my phone but not on my new kindle fire HD. I did download the free version first to see if it would load, but the up grade price of $2.99 was more than the $.99 sales price of the full game. I bought the full game and it works fine. I hope that the third version will eventually work too.
A14RYXJCCVGUOF B009T8X93O 5 1358294400 42 Works fine on my kindle fire HD. I didn't do the in game upgrade because it cost more than the sale price of the full version. So I bought the full version for $.99. I can play that game all day long.
A14S0IAPK3T6XJ B00HJ30F1U 4 1396569600 24 This is one of the few games I play that allows me to be briefly distracted and return to game without too much frustration.
A14S0IAPK3T6XJ B00F3W1GAS 4 1394236800 23 Don't play this game unless you are wide awake and ready for the challenge.  Not for a relaxing time, but for the challenge
A14S0IAPK3T6XJ B00HPUGZI4 3 1394236800 25 This is a good game for my grandchildren and they seem to be focused on it more than the usual time spent on most games.
A14S0TIHE1ZZ04 B00FAPF5U0 5 1386028800 40 Love candy crush saga!!! I play it when I'm on my laptop or kindle fire..I will be the first to tell everyone how addicted I am to the game..I have no troubles with the game on either of my devices...
A14S0TIHE1ZZ04 B00H59CTW6 5 1403568000 37 It's a very dreamy game...you get to design your dream house with your own taste..I love it!! I would recommend it to my friends & family..& it connects to Facebook so your friends can see your house.
A14S0TIHE1ZZ04 B0064X7B4A 5 1362873600 26 I play words with friends on Facebook. Love the fact of being able to  it on my kindle fire, it's more convenient. This app is awesome!!!
A14S0TIHE1ZZ04 B009LNHMLC 5 1388448000 33 Don't normally get word search puzzles on my kindle..but I'm glad I got this one, it's not boring...very addicting. I highly recommend this app to all ages..Thank you for a great puzzle app!!

A14S2HWLSMULME B0085VR7WU 5 1385596800 21 This is a fun interactive dice game. It is completely different from all the rest could use a a chat feature
A14S2HWLSMULME B00A9VD67E 4 1390608000 21 Many different games to choose from and hours of time passing games. The game has decent graphics and runs just fine.
A14S2HWLSMULME B0071PARPA 4 1379808000 20 This is easy to use and the back grounds are creative can't figure out how to get the download packs.
A14S2HWLSMULME B00I10HCV6 4 1396137600 36 When you are either waiting on some one or passing the time before you get off work lol. There are a few different ways to play the game it's not the same exact thing every time
A14S2HWLSMULME B00AF6MF9I 4 1390867200 20 The game can take w while to load sometimes but it is interactive with other players all over the world
A14S2HWLSMULME B00BLS2U6M 2 1387238400 50 The problem began with the last update you may be able to make 3 moves but after that it crashes and has to reload it has become a major inconvenience and it is not my device because it is the only one that does it and it started after update
A14S2HWLSMULME B00A9NXGAO 4 1363824000 21 The clothes are to expensive and it takes to much to make someone your boyfriend unless they are at the bar
A14S43QXL15TLX B0066T8JRK 5 1339545600 44 The game of life is a very fun game to play with friends or solo.  Its quick and is very entertaining.  If you like playing board games you should totally get The Game Of Life!!!!! I hope this review is helpfull to you :]
A14S43QXL15TLX B00B2V66VS 5 1359331200 21 Temple run 2 is a great second version of temple run 1 ! it is really fun and easy! 5 stars!!!
A14S43QXL15TLX B00B2WWEFE 5 1360195200 51 I love this game!! I had it before on my I-Pod and I loved it but now its on my kindle fire &lt;3 YAY cant wait to start playing it.  If you loved Diner Dash you should like Wedding Dash! Its a fun game for all ages and its free!!!  :D
A14S43QXL15TLX B0086700CM 5 1339545600 32 Temple Run is a totally awesome game ! You should soo get Temple Run you will love it! Its quick and does not have tons of pop up adds like some games.
A14S86BCI27A2Y B00529IOXO 1 1347926400 52 I thought updating this thing would be better!!! It really wasn't, it shows half a screen, and is so small and stupid. I still don't get notifications either, I hope the creators make a better update fast. Cuz this shit it stupid I swear. Don't recommend, thank you for your time. Byee'
A14S86BCI27A2Y B005KN4PEE 1 1324944000 48 I got a Kindle Fire for X-MAS and I wanted to fool my dad that the screen broke. Well... when I tested the app it looked hella crappy and fake I've deleted it right away.I thought it looked like it on the advertisement so I got it,it didn't.
A14S86BCI27A2Y B004Z9Y3VY 1 1325203200 55 ALL YOU DO IS PRESS A RED BUTTON AND READ THE TEXT THAT IT GIVES YOU. THE STUPID RED BUTTON SAYS THINGS LIKE WHY DONT YOU KILL YOURSELF OR YOUR DEAD AND BECAUSE OF YOU SO IS HEAVEN AND HELL. ITS DUMB THEN THE GAME REPEATS ITSELF SO I DELETED IT IN TWO MINUTES!!!!!  :/
A14S86BCI27A2Y B004Z2VHAQ 1 1324944000 39 RIGHT WHEN I DOWNLOADED IT ANYTIME I TOUCHED MY SCREEN IT BROKE I WAS LIKE WHAT THE HELL I DELETED IT BUT IT WONT STOP CRACKIN AND IT GOT STUCK LIKE THAT FOR TWO DAYS!!!! WASTED MY TIME!!!  :[
A14S86BCI27A2Y B006HUWEHY 1 1325116800 50 ALL THERE IS, IS AN ENDLESS LOOP OF HILLS, HILLS, AND MORE HILLS!!! THIS GAME IS ONLY GOOD FOR 5 YEAR OLDS AND OLD PEOPLE THAT HAVE A LOT OF PATIENTS. NO WONDER ITS FREE!!!!  WHO THE HELL MAKES GAMES LIKE THIS ITS NOT LIKE THERE GETTING MONEY FOR IT!!!

A14S86BCI27A2Y B00CQ9U1PW 5 1374537600 52 This game is really fun, I like that you can buy from tons of weapons to beat your boss. Its just funny that you can beat him till he dies, but besides that its really fun. Like I said.. you kill your boss to get money.. so you are like a murderer.
A14S86BCI27A2Y B004GVYXTS 5 1325203200 59 I ALWAYS PLAY HANGMAN WITH A PEN AND PAPER WITH MY BROTHER, NOW THAT I HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE SO NOW I CAN PLAY ANYTIME I WANT. SO TREE'S ARE SAVED AND OCTOPUS INK IS ASWELL??? I THINK, DO THEY USE OCTOPUS INK FOR PENS??? I DOESNT MATTER EVERYBODYS HAPPY!!! &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS AGES 10 AND YOUNGER.&quot;
A14S86BCI27A2Y B0086700CM 1 1342224000 39 Nothing is interesting bout' this app. I got it to see how it was, and I was surprised... Surprised at how stupid it was!! Everyone is playing it and saying its fun. Well in my opinion it really isn't.
A14S86BCI27A2Y B00657H8XO 5 1325289600 43 WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT I WAS THINKING TO MYSELF, THIS IS JUST LIKE THE ONLINE FREE GAME HOTDOG BUSH!!  EXCEPT ONLINE YOUR GEORGE BUSH OUR FORMER PRESIDENT THATS A HOTDOG VENDER!!! NOTE: HOTDOG BUSH REQUIRES A COMPUTER MOUSE WHEN PLAYED.  THEY COPIED!!!
A14S86BCI27A2Y B004Q3CJQ0 4 1324944000 50 I love this LED light, when our electricity shut off at night during a party we only had a couple candles. So I used my Tiny Flashlight and it lit up where we were hanging out at. This thing is very handy and super useful!!!  I love my LED light!!!!
A14SAPEFGO2SL5 B008K8VDPU 5 1383609600 20 I absolutely love this update! This has to be the best piano app ever! Get it  now!i glib glib glib
A14SAPEFGO2SL5 B006VXRNYG 4 1386288000 21 You can draw with awesome tools! Even one that looks like a sunset! There is even one with real 3D effects!
A14SAPEFGO2SL5 B00A8ECU24 3 1383004800 33 I like it but everything in canterlot costs way to much. You people need to lower the prices or I will stop playing. I won't spend all my money on a stupid game.
A14SAPEFGO2SL5 B009HKL4B8 4 1388361600 24 I love it! A big fan of Sims! I'm just really pissed that I bought coins for five dollars and I didn't receive them.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00FZEK72M 4 1389571200 24 So far, so good!  And, I will admit this is a challenging game.  Slightly  harder than I thought, but definitely in a good way.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B0080SC22I 4 1339718400 40 I played this on my kindle fire and it worked great.  the only thing keeping me from 5 star is the &quot;hint/clue&quot; button.  It didn't stay lit up long enough for me to see the little sparkles.  please improve that!!!
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B009ZHQLHA 5 1369872000 21 This is one of the best games I've ever played!!  I wish there were more canvas to uncover.  Please create more.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B008BM3TKM 5 1385078400 108 I think this game, and the II episode are two of the very best apps available.  I have played them on my 2nd Gen KF and KFHD 8.9&#34;I  have played them both over and over, finding new graphics and amazement each time. I wish more games were like this one, not easy but not totally unplayable without a walkthrough guide.  I'm not feeling like I have a blindfold over my eyes and totally clueless like so many other games, but not needing to seek a &#34;clue&#34; all the time either. Even the clues are challenging but logical.  I love them, and only wish there were more like it!!!
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00BX736EG 3 1379548800 41 This game is an okay game.  Some of the pics are hard to figure out, but after played a second time and really thought about them, I figured them out.  So think about them and it will be a great game.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B008K6HN8I 1 1374105600 49 I got this at the much trusted raving review of another kindle fire lover.  IT WILL NOT UP DATE, BEING USELESS.  What do I need to do, or what other type app like this should I try? For camera use with a KF HD?  Any suggestions will be appreciated.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B008GU42KK 5 1347408000 26 this is one of the funniest games I've played so far.  very neat entertaining and much enjoyment. please put part 2 or something more like it.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00881VLCE 4 1375142400 96 This is the best app/game I've got.  I thought my jigsaw puzzle putting together days  was over. Thanks so very much for this. I purchase more as they come available, along with the free ones.  I have gotten some wonderful comments when I share my completed puzzles on Facebook.  Keep them coming please!EDIT:8/03/2013Since getting my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 device and FINALLY getting all the bundled puzzles I'd already purchased on this fancy device, this game over heats my device, shuts it off in the middle of game play and freezes up.  Now, I'm baffled.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00F1XSETA 4 1379548800 26 This little game is a great way too pass time.  Not too difficult.  I'd recommend it.  It's the first one of this kind that I've played.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00846F1YW 4 1342224000 66 l love these games but have the same issues with it as I've had on other reviews of this kind.  It is when you hit the 'hint&quot; button because of all the glittering stars marking the response does not stay up long enough for me to find.  If that could be fixed all the games I play by this maker would get 5plus stars by me!!!!!!
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B007A2IPF8 5 1330732800 24 this is my kind of game!  I love the strategy n graphics.  it works great on my kindle fire.I love. the hidden objects game.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00CDBLC8S 4 1386374400 21 This is a pretty good game.  Easy enough with strategy as well.  I recommend this game if you like word game.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B009NF54ZE 4 1355184000 30 I absolutely love this game.  can't wait for the part 3!!!  the graphics are out of this world, look  real not blurry or fake.  can't wait for the next one.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00HETUEFG 5 1397606400 21 This game is great.  Pretty challenging but can eventually figure the pics out.  Different from other wood games.  I like it.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00ASKP5PW 4 1358553600 21 I haven't had time to get half way through it yet.  I'm not like some folks..finish in a day.  But will.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00CJ95O2E 5 1385856000 49 This battery saver is the best one I've used.  It is simple to use and understand.  HOWEVER unlike other reviewers here my little robot doesn't do cool things.  That's not a problem for me, but if he will I want him to.  I hope mine isn't a dud.  LOL
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00JRSXIZ0 5 1400284800 20 Liking these new games .  I like the fact that game instructions are easy to find.  Is interesting and challenging.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00I5WL0HW 4 1393718400 57 I am thoroughly enjoying this game so far, but I am curious to find out the other two games of this series put out by Big Fish that T.L.  &quot;The Kindle Queen&quot; is referring to in the review they posted in February of this year.  Please let me know, because I enjoy all the Big Fish games.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00EBQRSTK 4 1379721600 32 I'm enjoying this game so far.  It is reasonable with the puzzles being playable.  Some games like this are so difficult or &quot;odd&quot; that is it is not sensible.  This one is.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B008FF8PT0 4 1341014400 66 I've just started this game but so far is great.  I only wish the screen with the hidden objects was brighter.  even with my screen brightness setting on as bright as it can go I. still have trouble seeing it.  it's so dark.  other than that,  game is awesome.  ONE more thing..... it doesn't even give you any kind of &quot;help&quot; other than the hint button.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00HTKA4N2 5 1391558400 30 This game is a must have.  I completed it in 2 hrs plus a few minutes.  I only wish it was longer. I will definitely be looking for the sequel.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00GI8AMI8 3 1385164800 104 Help!! I never considered myself &#34;plum dumb&#34;  lol, but where is the strategy guide??? Where is the hint or clue s? And, where in the world is the note book/journal??  Gotta have a notebook/journal! So, I will be the first to say...&#34;I have taken my own notes, I've gone back and forward and front and right to left and back again...'I need some kinda clue.  Game at this point, makes no sense!!  I will definitely be leery of Echo Lake in the future.  Sorry, but give me something...just ole Davey getting this place out of luck is great, but I gotta have  more.  Lol
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B009AY04A8 4 1353888000 31 I've just started this game and so far it's interesting and fun.  if i could've waited before posting I probably might have given it 5 stars!!I've alreadyy purchased the next one!
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B0091REZMW 4 1383868800 20 So far, so good.  I'm not that far into this game yet,  but I'll give it a 4 star rating.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00B2W1RSY 1 1366416000 80 I have had this free version, and also bought the full version.  I have YET to achieve a successful download!  I am unable to download either one of them.  When I got the apps/games it said was compatible with my device.  I am using the Kindle Fire 2nd Generation.  This isn't the only game that won't download, but it is the current one that has failed.  I believe I have attempted to DL This one at least 5-6 times .
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B006R8GK2Q 4 1327968000 54 I originally got the free game, but purchashed it soon after. I love these kind of games, and this one is just as neat.  Just be careful touching the screen because all &quot;x&quot;s deduct 20 seconds fromyour tlme. It is a really neat game.  Wish there were more like this but a little harder.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B009DDKZT6 4 1372896000 65 I am absolutely loving this game.  I really need anyone to help!!!  Summer season, level 10.  Please tell me how to put only 3 pieces of yellow oddly shaped cloth, to create the 3 full sides?  I can do the orange ok.  Please, please respond to this with any suggestions!!!  I'll wait patiently.  Would send this to the developers however there is no way too.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B008NX8OCM 5 1362960000 44 This is by far one of my favorite e MahJong games.  I love the game.  Only place as yes it is  on a compute.  This particular game h as s slot of different scenarios with different tiles.  Really a good game err to play
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00E3BK0QQ 5 1397174400 27 This is one of absolute best games, in my opinion.  I wish more were like this one.  Absolutely worth the price.  I play out over and over.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00E5MN3DU 1 1378944000 26 I have tried 5 times to download this.  FAILED.  will not dowblnload.  I'm disappointed.  Not only it not being playable on the 8.9 it wont download.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00H83GGVO 3 1389398400 95 I gave this a three star,  because no matter how far in the game I am, when I quit the game and return to play, I can never, ever start back where I stopped.  I have to create a new profile and begin again!!  Is this common?  I did the "report a problem", but nothing.  HELP!UPDATE:  Well, after leaving review, going back to the game, WALLA it returns to stopped place in game without having to create new profile.  However, THANKS!!  Will review again once finished .UPDATE:  Wrong.  It is not saving.  I was wrong.
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B008N04TMO 5 1351209600 33 This as well as #1were awesome!  I'd advise everybody that likes these type games that these are some of the best.  I'll play them again and again.  hope to see a no. 3???
A14SC7SRAOXMWT B00CT9ZVGI 5 1379116800 33 I am always excited when Big Fish has a new game!  As with 99% of their games, this one ranks a 5 star from me!  Will be patiently waiting for the next one.
A14SFS7VIRP9FA B0086700CM 5 1357171200 63 My daughter and her cousins love this game because it is fast pasted. The tutorial was there when the kids needed it. It is addictive, the graphics and color are very good, the sound of the monkeys are very realistic. The kids can't wait to play it again and again.  The only question is where was the treasure or idol that was taken?
A14SFS7VIRP9FA B00DRA55DW 3 1376265600 76 I downloaded Toenail Salon for my daughter. She played it for 30 minutes and decidedthat is was boring.  While the graphics were good she found it hard to use the nailpolish icon to paint the toenails. Needless to say she became frustrated with it andwanted something else.  I am sure it would be a nice game to pass the time but Iwouldn't count on it being something you rather play with for an hour or so.
A14SFTFC5XGKC7 B00BMH4GQE 5 1366761600 24 Like the other ones but better in so many ways. One is that it is free and they are much higher quality of photos.
A14SFTFC5XGKC7 B009AEIMWA 5 1358380800 26 The app really helps you relax and sleep and you can get an alarm or a sleep timer set along with a variety of rain choices.
A14SFTFC5XGKC7 B00AAX68HG 5 1359504000 21 Try it. When you do you will know how I feel. Fun for anything. You will love it just like me.
A14SFTFC5XGKC7 B00G9B1MEM 5 1384905600 20 I had it on my mom's iPhone and I liked it, but on my kindle fire hd, I LOVE it!!!!

A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B004RJ6978 5 1321747200 42 Still needs some work but perfect for someone like me that just keeps lists everywhere. (I have to, so many books and dvds, I started buying them double)Wish you had option of sub-subnotes and also suggest to somehow incorporate a barcode option.
A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B007D2XSW0 5 1348790400 42 There is just so much you can do with this app. I've finally has the chance to tweek some of the pics I wanted to use as background but wouldn't because of one thing or another. PicShop let me do it. Thanks.
A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B004Y21WXE 5 1309910400 34 Love the free app from Amazon today. &quot;converter&quot;. I just uninstalled 2 apps in exchange. Like the description says...&quot; If it can be converted it will do it&quot;. And it's really easy to use.
A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B008245WE0 5 1344643200 21 Give me the sound of rain and I sleep. Now if you can add thunder to it....I'll sleep like a baby!
A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B0052UZIFA 5 1307232000 21 Just love it. Just totally addictive. I just wish there were more levels. I have already went through them all twice.
A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B005DO1N2W 5 1328745600 39 It does what it says. Cute!. Now if only I followed it. Like the option of reminding me to read it.Hey, if you ate not into this why download it? Or complain about it?Dan... Ever heard of scrolling down?
A14SLYVZ7YS2NY B0058EBNAO 5 1323043200 20 I stopped counting how many I have tried and never really found what I was looking for until this one.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00BHHIWQO 2 1374364800 22 It's OK but nothing special.  I was disappointed with it, I expected it to be more challenging and fun. Wouldn't recommend it.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00GY0PQZ4 3 1393804800 28 I like the challenge that it gives me.  It is a real thinking game.  At first I thought it would be too easy but I was sure wrong.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00FPISXPQ 4 1395360000 26 So far they have been pretty easy.  Hoping that as I progress they get a little harder. But all in all I am enjoying the puzzles.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00IKZX1ZI 4 1395360000 28 It is very similar to Candy Crush and I am enjoying it almost as much. It has the same type of challenges only a different cuter set up.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00FAPF5U0 2 1391040000 35 I am playing Candy Crush on my IPhone and on my computer but this version on the Kindle doesn't sync with them like Words does and I don't want to start an entire new game.
A14SMQKCJV938R B007TBAQCK 2 1391040000 23 I tried a few games and found it confusing.  I am looking for something simple and easy to play so I deleted it.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00ALKKM98 4 1393804800 25 I am always looking for something different but something that makes you use your brain.  This game does that.  I is a good challenging game.
A14SMQKCJV938R B006P0A5KO 2 1389744000 23 It didn't really give me much of a challenge.  Not real thrilled with it. Deleted it from my Kindle shortly after trying it.
A14SMQKCJV938R B00E4MCCF6 3 1394582400 23 I enjoyed Jigsaw World and would have like to continue except they wanted too much to do so.  Too bad it was enjoyable.
A14SRBP9YCTPGZ B0086700CM 5 1338422400 46 it is simply addictive and I love it!!!!!  Wish I had more time to play. I had seen some one playing this on an iphone and was waiting for it to come to android and kindle. what a happy day for me to finaly get it!
A14SRBP9YCTPGZ B0087HT36U 4 1347667200 30 Great easy game. Simple to play but very addictive. Like it better than AB. Been playing on and off all day and loaded to both my phone and my kindle
A14SRBP9YCTPGZ B0054JZC6E 4 1326067200 32 overall,  it is simple, fun and some what addictive. well worth the download. it would be great for kids. I have. not tried the up grade yet but am planning on it
A14SRSTL6KZCBB B008XG1X18 5 1389744000 24 I can use this anywhere..YEAH!!dont have to always be at a lap or desk top.much more convenientto view and dont have to disturb others
A14SU38ANQ0CDX B00846GKTW 3 1340668800 30 Its fun but the money will not be given yo you. :( ;-;jjjjhhhbhhvvyvyvh h y yvyvu u h h h u h h h h h h. h h. h
A14SU38ANQ0CDX B006OCM13M 5 1340668800 23 Its really entertaining *(^_^)z Once you have neighbors you just rank up (:add me!! Miss_SykesI van seriously just play this forever lmao xD
A14SU38ANQ0CDX B006OC2ANS 4 1334707200 22 Its okay. but my little brother loves it. xD fun when your bored xDDD Its not very bloody or gory either ^^
A14SU38ANQ0CDX B009OYOASG 5 1351123200 20 I downloaded bakery story awhile ago.. and loved it! I was addicted for awhile, and this is tons of fu
A14SVZ1DP2VQU9 B008JGSM6G 4 1343779200 65 My 12yr old recommended this game. Thought it had all the features his old man would like.. No guns for a start. He was right on the money, it starts out on an easy level so you can get familiar with the operation and strategy required and gets progressively more difficult without becoming impossible. I found that I could not put it down. Great game!
A14SVZ1DP2VQU9 B004SCG69A 5 1326240000 55 I will shoot tlstraight, its too hard. However, its one of the, no THE best completely free game on my kindle fire.  To me, survival mode made the game the most fun, and you can change the control setups so you can aim perfectly with the howitzer, or go dual sticks, like battle bears GO.
A14SVZ1DP2VQU9 B0054JZC6E 2 1325721600 112 At first glance, this game looked amazing.The problem is that most games feel stiff, difficult, and just not fun. Stiff games are the bane of my existence, digitally speaking. this game claims that you must earn points by playing old games to get more. However, they do not mention that after you buy a set of twelve games, you have to beat a certain score for all twelve to continue. And when you wrangle with controls, things can be quite stressful. I mean, one game you &quot;bounce&quot; a soccer ball by tapping it.but the engine makes it land anywhere it feels like! it's not really your best interest to play this game.
A14T4AL9QQCAJE B007SYWFRM 5 1340236800 40 THis game reminds me of the movie, "Ice Age".IT has terrific graphics and interactive play.The slouth is the main character.The wooly mammoth has conversations with the slouth.You can put objects onto the screen,and 'build' a tiny village.The game moves quickly!
A14T4AL9QQCAJE B00BOW41P8 5 1374710400 18 There are drop down options for every sectionof the newspaper.I find it very convenient & quick to load.
A14T4AL9QQCAJE B00DJFIMW6 1 1374710400 24 It froze up and would not load on Kindle Fire.The graphics are fuzzy.I wish it could work because it has cute soundsand story lines.
A14T4AL9QQCAJE B00632HWOG 5 1389225600 17 it works well with Kindle fireI had another email app installedand this one is betterIt installed seamlessly
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00GY0HJ4K 5 1388620800 45 If you are looking for the best game since Candy Crush, then this game is for you.  Fun, exciting, frustrating and adorable in the same game.  What more could you ask for.  I recommend this game to any age level and skill.  SO MUCH FUN!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00CD6R17O 2 1366416000 111 It is just an ok set of games: nothing to shout about.  Graphics a little childish, slow play, and not enough return.  I got bored real fast.  There are a lot of better slot games out there.  You just have to look.  I have down loaded so many I feel like a slot connoisseur.  I have rated so many and only impressed with a few. And those pop up ads are sooo annoying.  The game lets you know there is a bonus waiting for you and BOOM another stupid ad they want you to download something. That just isn't fair at all. Might be gone soon if they don't improve it.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00FAPF5U0 5 1388620800 20 Now I am ready for the rest of the sagas....Pet Rescue,  Farm Hero's, Papa Pear, etc.  BRING THEM ON KING!!!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00GGQLZUG 5 1385337600 48 Wow...who would have thought this much fun could be in a free app.  Delightful, indulgent, and satisfying all in one place.  Easy wins, bonuses, and mini games keep your attention.  At least some imagination and creativity were used in the development of these games.  A MUST TO HAVE!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00A79N0I8 2 1366416000 55 I have the kindle 8.9 and the viewing area of games only cover half the screen, right in the middle.  The games are fun, but since it is so small  you can barely see how you won.  I  would give this a higher review if I could see it...and I do not even need glasses!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B008R9OIUO 1 1345593600 45 I have tried many times to get this game but each time itntells me it is there but when I go to play there is nothing but a white screen.  I wish they would fix third as it looks and sounds great from the reviews.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B008D2QRAO 3 1356566400 83 THis app all of a sudden quit letting me get my daily bonuses.  It is one of the best slots game I have but they have become awful stingy with bonuses and harder to get any wins.  This is probably due to an upgrade they made....PUT BACK THE OLD VERSION! !!!!!!!  I may just lose interest. very fast and delete.  A month ago I would rate this game a 5 but now it's down to 3.  WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!!  PUT OLD VERSION BACK!!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B007SYAXIK 4 1366848000 20 Lots of fun, frustration, enjoyment,and  knowledge  go with this game.  Most definitily gets your brain revved up.  I love it.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00EQ4UF88 1 1380585600 28 One of the worst I Have seen.  Graphics yucky, slow, very low bonuses and payouts plus too many stupid ads....I hate ads.  Do not bother with this one.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00975HIYU 2 1348790400 70 why do all these newer games require facebook to play the games?this is really quite. stupid on the app side.  not all people want to be permanently want to be on liine just to play games.  this app is quite fun until you find out a lot of your hard earned coins are not given tonyou because you're not on facebook.  what a shame slot galaxy...I really did llike you.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00GXH3TGG 3 1391472000 35 Says to update before you can play, but where is update?  I am not going to delete from cloud and 're download just to lose all my coins.  Come on people...get your butts in gear!!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00DCU2TCC 1 1372636800 58 Even rate a review.  I wondered why I am even bothering to take the time.  This game is so badly  made that the developer should be ashamed.  Poor payout, poor graphics, poor subject matter, poor everything.  It seems that all the slot developers have become brain dead when it comes to new and a exciting games.  THINK GUYS!!!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00KSOQ66K 5 1404345600 68 Hit or Rich is one of the best slot game out there.  The graphics are great, the bonuses and payouts are good, plus the themes are so interesting.  This game from Zynga is one of their best.  I would recommed to all ages as some of the children (and adults) will recognize a lot of the themes.  Great bunch of games.  Can't wait to see what's next.  ENJOY!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00BN6K97Y 5 1363478400 34 What a fantastic game!!  If I could give this game 10 stars, I would in a heartbeat.  BEST SLOT GAME APP I HAVE SEEN, EVER!!  See for yourself cuz it is free anyway.  WOW!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00DX65ORM 5 1374019200 26 This is what a game should be!!!!!!  It has got everything an excellent game should have.  Way to go TOP GAME!!!!!  Do not miss this one!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00H343YNQ 5 1390348800 39 So many different games to play with most of them with animal themes.  Fantastic variety, with just enough good payouts to keep you coming back to play more.  One of the best on the market.  It is a Keeper.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00GTXFOIA 1 1385510400 42 Even load on my kindle fire, even after about ten times trying.  All it does is say download from Amazon app store.  All I get is lines running across my screen.  Looked good and if they fix it I will try again....maybe.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00GMIB0O4 1 1394064000 40 Takes forever to load, freezes,  doesn't give you bonuses, etc, etc, etc.  In other words, this game just does not work.  It sucks.  To bad, too, because it looks great.  Bye bye.  Let us all know when it gets fixed.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00H90NQG4 1 1389139200 29 If app wouldn't quit on me every 3 min.  Just when I'm starting to have fun again it stops, shuts down and I have to restart.  Doggone it all
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00KMX5V8G 5 1405641600 33 I have  been waiting forever for one of the best games from King.  Now I can actually see it larger than on my cell...This game has it all!!!  The best of the best!!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B0081IRIKI 3 1340668800 50 This is the same game from Facebook named Slotspots.  Just as the online version, this app doesn't work half of the time.  It mostly goes out when you are on a bonus round and then it loses all of your bonus points.  Too bad....some of these games are so gooooood.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B008NCUFYS 4 1345593600 28 wish the scores and balls would stay when you log off and come back later.  It is depressing to see big scores and a lot of balls disappear.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00FPYJLCY 4 1381795200 22 Throws me off line as soon as bonus comes up then poof...all gone.  Graphics good and seems to pay okay...just needs fixing.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00CNT8KW6 4 1373328000 104 This is a great game collection , but with 1 drawback.....no new games have been added for players who have gone through all the levels of all the games.  Very good payouts and pretty good graphics on most of the games.  Hopefully they will add new games soon.  If not then I guess I will delete it.  No fun playing the same games over and over and over.......BEWARE!!!!!!!  WHEN YOU DOWNLOAD THE NEW GAMES THEY HAVE THEY TAKE ALL YOUR HARD EARNED CHIPS!!!!  I HAVE OVER 8 MILLION AND THEY STARTED ME ALL OVER AGAIN.  NEEDLESS TO SAY I AM NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00FZUF5VY 1 1384992000 43 $100.00 every four hours really sucks especially since you do not win anything to keep you playing.  Graphics look great but what good are they if you cannot play?  If you are very rich or have a lot a patience do not bother.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00KQHVWWC 5 1402617600 26 Everything you want is here.  Great graphics, FANTASTIC.animation, great wins and the best super spin features you have ever seen.  Never going to beat this one!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00DG8N78A 2 1376352000 105 very different...graphics ok....but you are playing. against other people which is fun.  one drawback...ICannot get on facenook here so have to keep changing playing name.  running out of ideas.  it seems stupid to me.  I hope it is fixed soon.  otherwise good game.  I am changing me review from a five to a twobecause of all the trouble trying to buy credits.  As soon as you purchase, game goes out, no credits or powerups, but you sure get the bill from Amazon.  I have contacted both developer and Amazon about this problem for months now.  It works for a day, then more of the same.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00IS87HYI 5 1401580800 35 One of the best games ever!!!!  Good graphics, great animation, and. Strategy building all rolled into one.  I hop now they will come out with Germ Heroes Saga, which is Fantastic also.  Thank you King!!!!!
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B00E8W4HQE 1 1380585600 23 Too slow, terrible payouts and horrible,cheap bonuses, plus no auto play button.  What else is there to say?  Do not waste your time.
A14T57AOTAT7W6 B008878MQQ 4 1355011200 22 lots to choose from and fun bonuses...just wish they would add games quicker!!  different themes and good graphics....I like it a lot!!
A14T83BUJVB38 B00E8KLWB4 3 1397433600 22 the game is great but for the people with small screens its almost impossible to find everything. otherwise its a good game
A14T83BUJVB38 B00CTQ6SIG 5 1376697600 53 it's very slow gameplay but it gets in your head and you just HAVE to free all the people. Also, building your own Springfield is fun too. Unfortunately, the game makers want to get rich selling dounuts. The prices just don't add up and you feel like your getting robed by a game.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00CWY76CC 5 1372636800 27 This one was worth downloading. you have to think and that keeps your mind sharp. I'm actually looking forward to the new levels. so hurry up MobiGrow.
A14T83BUJVB38 B007AJU2MK 1 1332288000 21 This game is fine for kids, but beware, adults, mind numbing slow braincell death is inevitable. Stay clear of this game.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00E0I9EEG 3 1379548800 45 although the puzzles were a lot of fun and entertaining, I got through them on my lunch break. now the funs over because not all touch screens react to the same timing. more puzzles with small, large and mega lots would have been much better.
A14T83BUJVB38 B0088QGB7Y 5 1375488000 23 really fun game. too expencive to play.  I think beeline is using this game to finance another war. someone should look into it.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00DQ8APIK 1 1379289600 48 why do I have to pay 300 points just because I cant remember a name? if I don't want to (pay) then the game is over. I should be able to skip it and when I remember come back to it. at least then I could keep playing.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00CJ8P82Q 5 1388620800 34 excellent game to keep you on your toes. Better than Zuma. All it needs now are powerups to help you through those stages that make you want to slam your device against the wall!
A14T83BUJVB38 B00D5YT6IA 1 1372464000 55 its clear that it is deliberately set up so you have no choice but to spend money. If you get stuck on one,  that's it, the game is just wasted space unless you pay over and over. My kids weren't born rocket scientist, their trying to learn. there should be hints to help them along.
A14T83BUJVB38 B008NCUFYS 5 1364169600 68 this game is perfect for keeping your mind busy while your traveling, waiting in a doctors office, or just sitting at home waiting for something good to come on the boobtube!! But don't be stupid enough to spend $120.00 for balls, just be patient and it will give you more for FREE. There are other games to play while you wait. I recommend Coin Dozer, or Pride Claw.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00AA87JGU 3 1372464000 28 I just started the game so I cant give it a very high rank. the first level was stupid, but the second is showing a little more hope.
A14T83BUJVB38 B009UX2YAC 5 1365033600 29 If you need something to keep your mind busy for awhile then this is the game. Trying to collect things for your missions will keep you busy for hours.
A14T83BUJVB38 B008K3OOJM 3 1345680000 45 its aggravating to buy deco and not be able to place it where I want it in my tank. The only options are to move them from tank to tank or sell them. I don't like everything piled up in the middle of the tank.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00CDBLC8S 4 1375315200 34 This is a great game for reading exercise,  spelling practice, or just passing time. I do wish though it had a way to look at the picture for a minute after you guess it.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00CMMR9SU 1 1369440000 28 in order to get the stars required to move on, you have to play the level 80 times so the game will give you the right color bubbles.
A14T83BUJVB38 B0069EAMUY 5 1368316800 30 this is a great game for exercising the old noodle. Young and old alike can enjoy.  Perfect for young students to practice for spelling bees, or just expanding your vocabulary.
A14T83BUJVB38 B008IXP8IU 5 1370908800 60 For not trying to get rich off your game. I'm not one to buy into games, but this one is worth it because you give free daily and bonus games for playing. I've also improved my vocabulary simply by having fun. Their not easy but not so hard you cant finish them. That gives a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
A14T83BUJVB38 B0092KDEGG 4 1373068800 35 stop the stupid exhausted time limit and it will be a great game. If I were in the movie Saw, I don't think I would sigh and lay down to die because I was tired.
A14T83BUJVB38 B00EBE8MUG 3 1379203200 42 a fun game if you sit in front of the t.v. 60 hours a week. some folks don't like every genres of entertainment. it would be nice to have a pass button, otherwise the game is over when you cant guess one.
A14T8H3PJMONHV B008CJ19HY 5 1376784000 20 the kids can make all different shapes and designs with this game they think it is fun and like it
A14T8H3PJMONHV B007NZV2HK 5 1363737600 20 I have not played it much yet, but so far it been fun, these are my favorite kind of games
A14T8H3PJMONHV B0080H2TFE 5 1363737600 21 I ordered it off the apps because it looked fun, so far I have noy been able to put it down
A14T8H3PJMONHV B004K4RY9M 5 1363737600 20 this is a great game, i have books with word search but this is a lot more fun. no erasing

A14T8H3PJMONHV B004SCR8QU 5 1376784000 21 the kids can draw and paint and do all kinds of different kinds of activities with this game . its awsome
A14T8H3PJMONHV B00ABGEFWC 5 1384646400 21 Great GameMy grandkids picked this. they like the cartoon so they figured they would try the game and they love it
A14T8H3PJMONHV B0054JZC6E 5 1384646400 21 My grandkids picked this game, say it gives them a lot of different games to choose from, and i like that
A14T8H3PJMONHV B007CK1MEY 5 1363737600 20 My granddaughter and i have been having a good time playing this game, its fun to play against each other
A14T8H3PJMONHV B006OBWGHO 3 1384646400 22 got it for the grandkids. don&#34;t play it much. they seem to think it is not as fun as the other games
A14T8H3PJMONHV B00ALKKM98 5 1363737600 20 My oldest grand kid loves this gane, she plays forever and is really good at it.this is a fun game
A14T8H3PJMONHV B006MI4JEM 5 1363737600 23 Wanted to try this game and it exceeded expectations.highly recommend this game for everyone.It makes you think and be creative with your words.
A14T8H3PJMONHV B0063GORYU 5 1384646400 22 I like to play solitare so this game is a little more challenging and lots of fun. I play it a lot
A14T8H3PJMONHV B0063GSL60 5 1363737600 22 I really like this game, I like to play card games. and this is one of the better ones i have played
A14T9KMXC1QDJY B008Y7SMQU 5 1349654400 34 this app os so addicting. I thought it would be easy but its not. I know ur thinking honestly? how can it be (I thought the same thing)  and its tu. and hard too!
A14T9OB2VRV6NK B00EBFKPAA 3 1378512000 22 It's a fun family game. Me and my kids play for hours at a time! Keep the games coming! hours of fun.
A14T9OB2VRV6NK B00IAQ3RJM 5 1396828800 22 It's a great game! I love playing games like this to pass my day. So much fun.my kids love it as well.
A14T9OB2VRV6NK B00HFTHXMC 5 1390608000 22 This is an awesome new game that not only do I enjoy but my whole family enjoys also..I also love the graphics.
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B0091REZMW 5 1352678400 28 this game is great for all ages. my daughter and I sit and play together. I love that it has pictures, names, and hints. one of the best
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B00BXPQN2K 4 1389052800 91 when I downloaded it the first time I was happy. I play this on facebook so I knew what I was doing. however if I was not connected to the Internet then j had to start back to when I was last connected. sucks big time. especially when I advanced three locations and had a lot done. oh well going to try again this time with the net everytime. one more screw up and I'm done.other then that great Colors and fun for all ages. my 6 year old loves game.
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B00G5LQ5MU 4 1391385600 35 somehow not what I thought. its fun and makes u think. great way for kids to learn problem solving. I like that u can come and go and not start from the beginning each time.
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B00BWBHIUG 4 1378771200 24 very cute great wat to teach a kid to budget. also its very family friendly. love that I can make the fish swim fast.
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B00IZLM8MY 5 1401580800 67 I love this game. the adventures the people go on. plus you can log it to your facebook and put your friends in as characters. I have it on my phone as well and its fun. keep me occupied when km shaving treatments.also when u contact them in the help section. do give them time to answer but they will answer you. first game to do that
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B007NACZPI 5 1341187200 34 that t-rex. hell get ya if u don't watch out. I love this game. keep an eye out for when they want money. u do not have to buy anything to keep playing. enjoy!
A14TF3DEO08N1Z B008ZOHCKE 5 1378080000 121 this ap does more then I though it would. I can keep over 1000 books separated and organized. I can add and delete very easily. also best feature I have found was that it has a voice read out option. this has come in handy when I lost my voice and I had to teach a class. yes the voice talked fast but yet you could keep up. I don't like that if u have to pause for a moment it starts back up from the beginning. however I did find that all voice readers do that so I guess its not a big deal. now to create a checklist too and I can loose another ap. something to think about.
A14TMSMEAHUY8D B009KS4XRO 4 1392595200 24 Game is fun to play, but when you get into a really full room bingos come so fast that it slows down the game.
A14TMSMEAHUY8D B004HXHVZ8 4 1402876800 22 Great free movies and lots of ways to get more of them.  Would like to see new ways to earn new movies.
A14TMSMEAHUY8D B006R8GK2Q 4 1340582400 20 This a great hidden object style of game.  And its nice to have a story behind the game.  Great Game!!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B005HSL626 2 1376611200 23 This really just wasn't for me. A fun game, but as I said, not really for me. Maybe for someone in their teens.
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00BGC5UAG 1 1373587200 23 This game jut wasn't for me. I really didn't like it. Something more for younger kids, then young adults. Kids would like it.
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00AIQP9DE 1 1373587200 22 This game would not work for me on my Kindle Fire. It would download and the get stuck at the last %
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00ATPVA78 5 1373587200 23 I liked this game a lot the graphics were good and it was a lot of fun to play and to kill time!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B008NX8OCM 3 1373587200 21 It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. The graphics, I think, could use a little work. That's all
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B008FF8PT0 5 1376611200 20 This was a really fun game, the story line was great and the graphics were amazing! Def a fun game!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00BXOAX40 5 1373587200 26 It's a fun game and I love how you don't have to sync up to FB and play it, you can just play as you go!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00BJA2VFW 5 1373587200 20 This game really was a lot of fun! It's a great time killer but it's also fun to play. G
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00E8KLWB4 5 1377043200 32 this is such a fun game to play!  I love the fact that it is an ongoing game and not something that you play for an hour an you are done! !
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00AEJPK0C 3 1371513600 20 It's a fun game but can be a little on the reptitive side, but it's ok to kill time with.
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00B2V66VS 1 1373587200 20 to download all the way onto my kindle it. It kept getting stuck at the last percent of the download.
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00910Y1OQ 5 1373587200 20 This was a fun and challenging game! It was a great way to pass the time and it was fun!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00514DIE0 1 1373587200 20 Yea, not as fun as I thought and the graphics were too small from me to see the tiles. Disappointed.
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B0085CEBGY 5 1338163200 30 this was a great game, however I wish it were just a little bit longer. I would pay more for a longer game. but the price was perfect for it!!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B0086700CM 3 1373587200 26 I like this game a lot my hubby and I have a little competition going on with the game to see who can score more! lol
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B008LXN9II 1 1373587200 22 Sorry, I love hidden object games, to kill time, but this was NOT a good game. Graphics were not impressive at all!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B008N04TMO 5 1373587200 23 Great game with amazing graphics and a great story line! Loved both of these games in the series! It's a lot of fun!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B0084DYNGC 5 1338163200 22 great hidden object on my kindle fire!! would highly recommend this game for anyone who loves hidden objects!! great job big fish!!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B00A4EZ3QS 1 1371513600 20 It really wasn't that great. It was an ok time killer but other than that it was not that fun.
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B005EIRU6U 5 1373587200 24 I like this solitaire game the best out of all the pyramid games out there! It's a great time killler and fun to play!
A14TN9U3CVWJS7 B008MEM24S 4 1376611200 22 It's a fun game, just really wasn't for me. I would say that for kids from 6-16 would have fun with this.
A14TOHVJY8UG76 B00A9JG6RS 4 1355875200 29 good game to kill time. also needs some thought to get through each level. deffinately a good free game but would pay .99 for it and not have minded
A14TOHVJY8UG76 B008Y2FRFO 5 1349568000 37 I didn't think I would like it but I find myself going back to it over and over. it is s good time waster when I don't want to think about what I a doing to much.
A14TOHVJY8UG76 B0086700CM 4 1338336000 41 this is deffinatly one of the better f.a.o.d I have gotten. I would not have minded paying a 1or 2$ for it. I give it a strong 3 to 4 stars. I wish I could say the same for other f.a.o.d.
A14TOHVJY8UG76 B00FJWGHZG 5 1382227200 39 Good match game. It is a good time passer. It is know candy crush saga but it serves it's purpose since its free it's even better. But it is worth 99 cents if you had to pay for it.
A14TOHVJY8UG76 B00CH26TL8 4 1382918400 34 So glad to finally see king bringing some of the games to kindle. It was my one disappointment with my kindle. This is one of the better time killing games that isn't to easy.
A14TQSTTMPXNUB B00DEG4Z1W 5 1372377600 25 It's a really nice game even though it takes money to upgrade you don't HAVE TO and its time taking (which is good ) :)
A14TQSTTMPXNUB B00ANH526W 5 1372377600 38 The game is so fun to play the only bleepin thing is ...... if you really want to have nice stuff you have to pay up with real money and I can't even get the beach house aaaaaarrrrrrrrrgggggggggr
A14TQSTTMPXNUB B008K8VDPU 1 1384128000 101 My mom says using the word &quot;hate&quot; is to explicit, but I think hate is the perfect word for this app, and I have 5 reasons to hate it.1. Having to move the piano to get to other keys is time wasting2. &quot;You need the diamond pack for this&quot; is agitating to see every time you press a button3.maybe this is just me but I was looking forward to better piano songs4. Apps pop up in the middle of you playing a song, that's annoying5. Does not teach how to play the piano (I wasn't expecting it to do that though...)
A14TUPMFXAUHOP B008Y7SMQU 5 1352592000 59 I was just looking for something to do I went yo the app store and found it and 5 Mins into it I was all like wholly crap this is hard I ones what it was its just j didn't k ow how to spell it get this app asap now I love. us u know yeah get ignoble
A14TUPMFXAUHOP B00AKFBURC 5 1383436800 23 It's funny how u can kick people wall u run and grandma's can run that good so it's funny how she can run
A14TUPMFXAUHOP B007L3M1W4 5 1337644800 22 just a good time killer and my doughters play it all the time and use there imageanations its fun for my girls
A14TUPMFXAUHOP B00FATEJYE 5 1390521600 22 I have this game on my Wii u and its amazing but the kindle addition is just like it on the Wii
A14TVZL46Q8A21 B009G9KFQ0 5 1372723200 55 I love this app!!  It's so helpful. It gives me alerts when it's going to storm or when there's a watch for something bad.  I use it all the time.  It works perfectly on the kindle fire HD and is easy to use!  If you are looking for a weather app, this is the ONE!
A14TVZL46Q8A21 B008B88LEU 5 1387324800 106 This game is very addictive and works GREAT on the kindle fire HD!  I play it every once in a while so I have enough turns to play.  The more you don't play the more turns you get.  Every time you put an object down, you use a turn.  There are not unlimited turns.  You can buy turns but they get really expensive.  You have to use real money.  You only get 2 maps to play on.  If you buy the game for $2 you get a new map.  Then you can buy more maps!!  And repeat.  This is a great time waster and is lots-o-fun!!
A14TVZL46Q8A21 B007VUA7VO 5 1368489600 25 I love this battery app!!!  It is easy to use and when I plug my kindle in to charge, it goes straight to this app.
A14TVZL46Q8A21 B00DQ8APIK 5 1375833600 42 I love this game!!  It's easy to play and is so indicting.  There's some weird brands, but you get a free letter every few seconds.  Don't listen to any of the other reviews, because this game works perfectly on the kindle fire.
A14TVZXDBSB5VY B00IAQ3RJM 5 1398902400 27 I love this game love the challenges,the daily coins, the special effects and the fact that you can 're due any level just love t he GAME
A14TVZXDBSB5VY B00CEBKMN8 5 1375833600 62 I love this coin game it's the best one so far I've played other coin games but this one out do them all l ok love it. I would like to know how the spin is activated I love the way it all just jumps out at you the art is so real it's crazy who ever designed this app Great job
A14TVZXDBSB5VY B00BMW6ER8 5 1392336000 24 I so love this game it's so much better than the original bingo rush I play this Version more than my other bingo games
A14TVZXDBSB5VY B00DT4GRTM 5 1383868800 31 I really love this game but like the others I wish you would give more coins and gold it takes too long to get them but I still love the game.
A14TXMCBEHU13C B00I8Q77Y0 4 1393372800 20 I like the game because its fun to play against or with family and challenge each other and also friends
A14TXMCBEHU13C B00594XOZU 5 1393459200 23 its fast and fun you get to talk to all your friends and people from all over the world its great get kik
A14TXMCBEHU13C B00C8R8TZ6 4 1371686400 29 first one I was stumped...I like this game though, I especially like that you can post to facebook for help...few too many ads. have fun and God Bless ;)
A14TYCEGRV76WG B008L29K6E 4 1353024000 24 This is an awesome game. I just wish that there were more puzzles! But how can one really complain when the game is free?
A14TYCEGRV76WG B00ALKKM98 5 1356566400 29 My whole family liked the first Flow game, so I decided to get this one as well. An excellent decision! I really enjoy the extra challenge the bridge creates.
A14TYCEGRV76WG B00820STKI 5 1342483200 101 My 4 year old, 6 year old, and 11 year old all love this app. They fight over who gets the next turn! I even enjoy playing with it. It's fun to see what shape the fireworks will be next!The games are nothing amazing, but they're still really fun. And they are easy enough for kids to figure out, even if they aren't able to read yet.Awesome for a free app. Purely entertainment- don't expect your child to get a counting or spelling lesson from this. But it is great fun, and I think it's fun for more than just toddlers.
A14TYCEGRV76WG B00BWBHIUG 2 1372982400 189 ... it isn't working for me right now.I loved this game. All the good things in everyone's reviews? Completely true. It's beautiful, it's engaging, it's clean, it's simple to play, it's a really awesome game. Yes, there are things you need pearls for, but you can earn them. It just takes time. This game requires a degree of patience. I have never had an ad appear, which earns it the only two stars it gets from me right now.But for about the last week, it won't load up. I get a game pop-up that tells me the connection to the server isn't available and to try again later. My internet is working fine, the issue is something with the game. When I can play the game again, I'll give it the five stars it deserves.I have had a problem with it freezing up my fire now and then. Not often enough to make me not want to play or to take away any stars, though!As for the people who call it a &quot;money grab&quot;? Uhhh, hello? Disney. And aren't most games? If it's not &quot;in-game content&quot; then it's ads.
A14TYCEGRV76WG B0073LHCCS 5 1355184000 31 Word games are my favorite games and this is one of the better games available for the kindle fire. I've had no problems with crashes or freezing up. Awesome brain exerciser.
A14TYUDDO5CN47 B0069G5Z9K 5 1349222400 20 Seriously.  Awesome.  The whole collecting money to upgrade + playing slots at the end makes for one heckuva addicting game.
A14TYUDDO5CN47 B00A2RZDZI 5 1352592000 21 Just when you thought they'd run out of ideas, here comes this one.  Awesome.  Light sabers, lasers, the force, cmon people!
A14TYUDDO5CN47 B006D1ONE4 5 1323043200 30 This game is great!  it's exactly what I hoped it would be- great puzzles, funny concept, and a great sense of accomplishment when you figure out the difficult ones!  excellent!
A14TZTY4KRRV4U B007U7BIO8 5 1360627200 21 Great features from colors to different sound choices and selections. I would def download this one to use.  I love it.
A14TZTY4KRRV4U B0094BB4TW 4 1360627200 36 I have to sign in and out to make facebook update.  I am not sure what is wrong with this software.  I eventually get to view and post after turning on and off a few times.
A14TZTY4KRRV4U B005ZXWMUS 5 1365292800 40 We are very pleased with WiFi and Netflix. I love how it updates after you watch a movie to try to find another movie with similar taste. We have a bit of freezing now and then but overall love it.
A14TZTY4KRRV4U B00A757EFW 4 1360627200 48 I can play this for hours and when you reach a certain score it turns you off and wants you to pay for a full version.  I don't want that monthly charge.  I keep playing over the same levels and its very exciting and precise with the movements.
A14U0KCH5N86LK B007U8JRWW 5 1360540800 109 We love this app! It is so interesting to watch people all over the world and different areas to see the time changes and season changes esp between the north and south equator. Our favs though are the pet cams. It is such fun to watch dogs at play it makes us laugh esp the ones in the swimming pools! We have actually named several dogs that we watch regularly and see different personalities. One little dog seems to know the camera is on her and she walks forward and backward on her hind legs and looks up at the cam. So funny and cute! Well worth the price!
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B00A04F8NU 5 1356393600 34 I love this game! As stated prior its cute and not only do I really enjoy but my grandchildren as. well. The story is cute and the graphics are great! 5 big ole stars!!!!!!!!!!!
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B00CH26TL8 5 1388534400 23 I love this game......after the 1st level I was hooked! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a challenge and lots of fun!
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B00F0VLN2S 4 1382313600 23 so far I love it.....I have almost completed level 1. it is interesting a diff from most hidden object games....bf makes the best
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B00AR1AUAW 5 1358294400 20 this is a great game to exercise the brain......fun fun fun to play.....definitely get this app you will love it!
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B009RC8UFO 4 1356912000 41 have only played 5 whole minutes but like it do far.....I read other reviews that it cost $4.99 to continue and I don't usually buy games that cost more than $1.99....but will see how I like it when demo runs out
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B0097HTPE4 5 1350172800 23 I am addicted to this game.....love love love it!! Helps with the kids with word meaning learning is more productive when its fun
A14U4I3KTB9G9F B009LGKCS4 5 1350259200 23 I just bought this game tonight and already hooked! Best word game ever!! Plays perfect on my kindle fire! Kudos to the creator!
A14U5RX9VBCOM1 B005VS7A1I 5 1379462400 21 lately youtube.com hasn't been working on my kindle...so I downloaded this and I will be posses if I cant watch videos
A14U5RX9VBCOM1 B00F2UZ2UQ 4 1403654400 69 I honestly love this game. It is right up there with virtual families, but... well I went to sleep and all my villagers died. I though &quot;oh its no big deal. it will only be one time&quot; and I restarted the game. I went to bed the next night and it happened again. then again. and again. eventually I had to delete it because I would get no where.
A14U5RX9VBCOM1 B007DLSWJ0 5 1357862400 26 a b c d e f g h I j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

A14U5RX9VBCOM1 B00F7YHDWC 5 1381622400 54 This app is fun funny great cool and everyone loves to play and watch others play it. I got this originally for my ten and six year old sisters but found myself enjoying a level often. I would lend my kindle fire to my friends and they would play this app and loved it.
A14U5RX9VBCOM1 B008N1V11U 5 1345420800 34 I love batman I always have and always will I am a kid so buying a 7$ app was not acceptable with my parents so endless chores to pay it off definetly worth it
A14U5RX9VBCOM1 B007F2EGFQ 5 1337126400 31 omg this is the 3rd best app ever to me you may have a different opinion well to bad it has fairys and people and money lots and lots of mny

A14U92H8OXW3BC B00H0BGCJK 5 1397001600 49 This game is very good. You can create your own monster, your own style and fight other monsters. You can also join other people's game. Mine is Furious. This game makes me non stop on my kindle. I can't stop. Get this game! AMAZING!!!! Thanks for taking your time
A14U92H8OXW3BC B00A3E2BVE 5 1376438400 33 This game is awesome fun for everyone and every age can do it too but first it takes awhile to load at first sometimes fails but is a very fun game! : )
A14U92H8OXW3BC B00B2V66VS 5 1376438400 52 A great game! does not even take forever at all. way way way better than temple run because has great new items and is very fun, more camera affects witch means you can see more clear! And really the truth is well let me get to the point.... ITS A AWESOME GAME!!!
A14U92H8OXW3BC B009ZXT4BY 5 1375401600 27 I love it! But if you don't buy the full version you only have a.short time I got the full version so it's pretty awesome for me
A14U92H8OXW3BC B008JJ7XYK 5 1376524800 59 This is a great game really fun just takes awhile to load and update stuff but it's supposed to be like that : ) . Anyway it's a fun game were people can learn and build up there imagination about monster's so have fun with this app and its not a waist of your space on your kindle! :)
A14UEA5K0JKFWP B0060I3IJG 5 1326672000 20 this is a great app for wasting tons of your time with with a nearly non-productive app. I love it!
A14UEA5K0JKFWP B005A89508 5 1336348800 30 I love all the negative ratings because it is a cheat app so I thought I would counter those ad best I could. App works ss designed. Good job Conspire.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B007RDTICY 5 1373500800 45 I'm not able to play Mahjong on my computer and I really enjoy playing it on my Kindle Fire.  It keeps my mind sharp and that is always a good thing.  Helps past the time when you are waiting doctors offices, car being serviced, etc.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B00FAPF5U0 5 1384300800 67 I have played Candy Crush Saga on my pc for some time and was very pleased when it became available to play on my Kindle.  I travel a lot and it is great to continue leveling up when I am away and not just when I am home.  I probably would have paid for this game, but downloaded it when it was free for the day.  Win/Win!
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B00AMR1HZ8 5 1369526400 88 Anyone that likes the television show will like this game.  I haven't played this game on my own Kindle, but I have played it on some one else's Kindle.  I so enjoyed it, that is the main reason I purchased this game.  It is exactly like the show.  The sound and pictures are so good it makes the game exciting.As of 2 days ago I have played Wheel of Fortune on my own Kindle and it is still as much fun to play as I had indicated above.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B0081JPTXK 5 1370995200 38 This game is just as exciting on my Kindle as it is to play on Facebook.  The graphics are excellent as well as the sound.  This is really fun to play when I have a few extra minutes.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B0064X7FVE 5 1372204800 42 I travel a lot and it is always nice to be able to check the weather for whatever place I am going to or my home area.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know their local weather in real time.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B00636V5CM 1 1370995200 36 In order to read it you must have already purchased a subscription.  If I had a subscription I wouldn't be reading it on my Kindle!!  I think this information should be made available prior to purchase.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B009LGKCS4 5 1372204800 74 I like word games and this one is certainly a lot of fun to play.  It can be frustrating when you get down to the last 1-2 words and you can't play them, although that doesn't happen to me to often.  Frequently I complete the game in record time which is shown on the screen, which makes me feel good.  I was visiting family over the weekend and my sister really enjoyed it also.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B007MTQ8C6 5 1373500800 29 I play this frequently on my computer and now I can play it on my Kindle.  It is a quick and fun game to play and I like that.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B0063M22QO 5 1369526400 29 I like to challenge my mind and this is certainly a good way to do it.  I haven't played the timed games yet, but will in the near future.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B005ZXWMUS 1 1370995200 29 I really can't give this a good review for the simple reason that I didn't order it and I don't know how it suddenly popped up on my Kindle.
A14UEBU6PAY4A2 B007TBAQCK 2 1369526400 36 I can't give a good rating for this product since I haven't been able to open it.  If a game doesn't open fairly quickly I am not going to sit around waiting for it to open.
A14UGDSBCWLANG B006SMEV9K 5 1382054400 35 i have this on the iphone and love having it on the Kindlei am always jotting things down on paper and this is so mucheasier as it is always with me. Good app and free!!!
A14UGDSBCWLANG B004JKCMGM 5 1382054400 19 great game to keep your mind alerti love word games anyway!!wish they gave more time on the game though
A14UGDSBCWLANG B007EC27QM 5 1382659200 31 I am very satisfied with this app. The calculator is a great size and easy to use. I like that it keeps the last entry showing incase I second guess myself.
A14UGDSBCWLANG B00BJSJKJ4 5 1382400000 24 I always played this game years ago and it is better on the kindle.The graphics are nice and it's easy to play.  Love it!!
A14UGDSBCWLANG B00CRLSN4U 5 1390521600 31 We love movies and this game really makes you think! I love the fact that it has mostly recent movies and a lot of popular movies anyone would enjoy this game
A14UJE0ZTDIXWW B00846GKTW 4 1337904000 65 A lot decisions need to be made with game, so I think it is not for young players but is perfect for teens and tweens.  As usual continual purchases of &quot;points, game cash&quot; is necessary which gets expensive.  I would rather buy the game than mess with this constant cycle. Otherwise the game is entertaining and somewhat educating as to fashion and creating a style.
A14UJE0ZTDIXWW B007SYWFRM 4 1337644800 26 This keeps the grandkids busy and happy and I find myself playing it too.  It is necessary to. wcontinue to buy acorns which gets very expensive.
A14UJE0ZTDIXWW B006U0Y07I 4 1343088000 24 This will keep you interested longer than most other hidden object games.  Not great for very young players but preteens and adults will enjoy.
A14UJE0ZTDIXWW B007USZX7U 5 1364860800 24 Great for young children learning to match objects.  Timer allows older children and adults to challenge themselves to beat the previously recorded Best Time.
A14UJQCJLN5DW2 B00DRPVE3M 5 1390608000 41 I've always loved Uno so when I saw the app I thought why not try it? I wasn't disappointed, and the neat thing about it is you actually play with other people around the world so it's a pretty cool game.
A14UJQCJLN5DW2 B00BJ9VBLI 5 1387843200 22 This game is a fun little timeline! Much better than jeweled if you ask me, works great with my Kindle Fire too!
A14UJQCJLN5DW2 B0067Q42BY 4 1325548800 35 Great time killer.The tiles are a little small of course because I downloaded it on my cell, but bigger than most mahjong games. I bought it for.my sony ericsson xperia play and it works great.
A14UNU4GMCJ3MA B004X80QNG 4 1323302400 38 This is a great app the only thing that is missing is a widget. Syncs with google calendar and tasks. Has many options to modify to your taste. I'm using it on my galaxy s2 and galaxy tab.
A14UNU4GMCJ3MA B0055DUUDE 4 1308441600 24 this is a good game, i had no trouble installing it on my galaxy tab. The graphics are excellent and so are the controls.
A14UOFISIBKTXU B00BJSJKJ4 5 1366761600 24 I love word games.  This one is great, the speed keeps you on your toes!  Even my husband and friends are addicted to it.
A14UOFISIBKTXU B0064X7B4A 5 1367107200 27 Love this game!  Keeps me in touch with family and friends. I don't win every game - but it's fun to relax and compete with each person.
A14UOFISIBKTXU B00AEJPK0C 4 1383091200 23 A lot of fun to play usually.  Rather annoying when constantly resetting over and over when there are no moves on each reset.
A14URC8NFCHVA2 B00J4YTRP2 2 1397174400 42 These games are so short I finish one in 3 days and are not worth the cost when it is not expanded to last a lot longer.  If it was a longer game I would give it at least 4 & more.
A14URC8NFCHVA2 B0066WJLU6 3 1397174400 20 good until the computers are shut down  (electricity)  otherwise I would not use it much unless the kindle still works
A14UROZCRNXT1C B00AZOSBTI 4 1377907200 29 This game is similar to another I've played.  The control of the games lies with the game and not with the player.  May be more interesting at higher levels.
A14UROZCRNXT1C B00FAPF5U0 5 1382486400 23 Mostly a lot of fun.  Some levels present more challenges than others but over all one of the most enjoyable games I've played.
A14UT3JZ498B4Q B00AIUUXHC 5 1388620800 21 This game is definitely one of my favorite games because it is so addicting. I can't stop playing its too epic!
A14UT3JZ498B4Q B006AZZPCM 2 1373846400 126 The app like all other youtube apps for kindle works good for a second but then it breaks. I have downloaded and un installed Tube Mate, vTube, and Play Tube so many times I lost count. IF ONLY ADOBE FLASH PLAYER&trade; CAME WITH ALL DEVICES. It just gets a little annoying when you're trying to watch a youtube video and all you get are Error messages saying &quot;Tube Mate has stopped working unexpectedly!&quot; It started causing problems on my kindle. When I try to look up videos on silk I get a message saying &quot;Silk has stopped working unexpectedly and has been terminated!&quot; So my best advice for people that want to watch youtube is to watch it on a device that has a flash player.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B0051UP5NQ 5 1395619200 82 No ads. If you can use Microsoft Office, you can use this. I got this when it was a faotd a long time ago and glad I did. I am able to edit and create with this app. I can sign docs with it and write protect docs. Spreadsheets are easy to add to and edit, too. PDFs are easy to view. No complaints. I would have bought it for full price of it hadn't been offered by Amazon as the faotd.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B00840HIUS 4 1339372800 25 cute game to pass the time. I don't pay attention to the nickeling or diming because I don't get that into it.good time killer though.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B005UOK2KY 3 1354320000 33 This is exactly like paper toss with minimal differences such as a blender in place of the trash can and fruit instead of paper. Great for a 6 yr old... uninstall. (Droid 3)
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B00CEBO09A 3 1371254400 208 Start with the game.... the game cracks me up! Its enjoyable and the chickens response to failing certain obstacles is hilarious! The music is cute and adds to the hilarity of the game. It definitely makes me laugh.The ads and the rest of the cretin nonsense that makes the game bad... IAP, push notification, access to my Amazon acct. For this I have to be super careful like the Ninja Chicken or get plugged with the dog cannon. Uninstall.**Edited - Update** Sometimes it's just easier to find your PC instead of trying to leave a review on a tablet or phone. (typos corrected). The developers should be ashamed to add so much nonsense to the game. If I want to exit this stupid game, the developer should NOT force me to go through 3 pages of "wouldn't you like to try this game? Or this game?" UGH! Seriously. Shameful and it borders deceitful and desperate. If you're not a talented enough developer to create a game that will sell itself, then you need to get employed in the brick and mortar world. I like the game, but I hate the desperation of the developer who bully's the very people who'll make or break his ridiculous business! ***Edit Complete**
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B0071APYJY 3 1390262400 185 At the end of the transaction, it does what it needs to do. However, there are a few things about this app that frustrate the user (that being me). One, it's very difficult to figure out what pizza is what. Just because there are millions of people using this app, it doesn't mean that all understand what your specials are. I'd like to see this app clearly show what is on each pizza. I don't want to guess that's what I'm getting because I'm not paying for what I don't want no matter what this app does. Two, it's difficult to navigate through the menus and find the Manager Specials, etc. That should be a tab all its own. Finally, you should never ask to save someone's credit card information. Even if you have a million people who want to do that, there's many, like me, who do not want that offer. Overall, it does what it is meant to do at the end of the confusion and if you've been able to navigate the app and order what you want, it'll get it done...
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B006GWE5PM 4 1376956800 58 This game wasn't very visually appealing from the onset of looking at it before I downloaded it, but after a few rounds of golf, I started to enjoy it. It's challenging if you're not used to the controls but once you get that skill mastered, the game is fun to play. I'd recommend it to a friend! :)
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B004V5A7K8 4 1354320000 56 This app takes me back to the days of pong when PC games were h'll to install let alone play. What a great time wasting game. On a negative note, some times the game lags and you will lose a game ball when it does. That needs some work. Other than that, it's a good FAOTD.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B007SN9TKE 5 1390262400 57 Whenever you're looking for a recipe to fix at home, this app will make it much easier for you to get it. Matter of fact, it'll give you many variations of the recipe you're looking for and maybe you can change one up to make it a little different. Wonderful app. Wouldn't trade it for another one.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B0081IWNYO 2 1390262400 34 This app seems to have a good idea, but when it starts adding words to what you're saying, I can't say that it's on top of its game. Didn't like it and uninstalled it.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B004UNGZ8Y 1 1313280000 20 bleh Amazon...u know better! As for the developers, why would you prey upon those who don&apos;t understand 2.0 android software?
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B004IAE62Q 3 1317340800 21 Um, and it has the look and feel of atari. The lack of accuracy and smooth control is awkward and lags.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B00GRVV29E 4 1394150400 70 I you are looking for a quirky app that will help you to relax and just show down after a long day, this'll do it. With the color scheme and the patterns and motion, it is a great way to calm down and let the day pass on. It doesn't take much to use the app and it is nice to have. Cute. The no stress app of the day.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B0096A9QXC 4 1398297600 150 Played through a few levels. The object is simple enough. In some way or another, you navigate the scenes in one way or another to get the  most objects required as you can before time is up.  Chances are kids will adore this game as  it is challenging their dexterity,  hand  eye coordination,  math and colors as well as speed.  The controls are taught on a  by level basis and are simple  to do.  Depending on your device sensitivity settings will  determine overall whether you can complete levels to continue game play.No ad ware and that is a plus.  There is an option for in app purchase but everyone now knows how to control that.  Nothing nefarious about the game. I am bored with it now after just a few levels so be aware that adults are not going to go  crazy over the app but  kids will.  Good game.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B007D3BQY6 3 1349136000 20 Its like the eight ball. Random generation of goofy but relative things. Cute but not a long term app. Uninstalling.
A14UTTY3I2IV4W B007ZSADMK 3 1355961600 69 Okay, so it's a kids game. Typically about 4 yrs to 11 yrs old. Would possibly teach hand/eye coordination but overall, not really much for anything else. It's a superb time killer if you're into these kinds of games. Not for me though. Downloaded it in case I have a kid I have to entertain over dinner but uninstalled it within 20 minutes of getting it as the FAOTD.
A14UVXC18B1A6Q B00658U5HE 5 1344297600 26 I wanted an app to track my battery usage and this app does that.  I am very happy with it. I would reccommend it for everyone
A14UVXC18B1A6Q B00FEMJF6O 5 1385510400 20 The graphics on the Kindle Fire HEX are much better than on my IPad 2. I also enjoy the quests.
A14UVXC18B1A6Q B008K3OOJM 5 1352592000 35 This game has really nice graphics! Love the reefs! Far better than the rest. The fish actually look real. I just wish it wasn't such a slow starter. Still trying to get some nice fish.
A14UVXC18B1A6Q B00BWBHIUG 5 1370563200 28 It is a bit of a slow starter,  but once you get lots of algae producing corals planted,  it is a lot of fun! I love the graphics!
A14UX8HGWKRZ3C B00CEBKMN8 5 1376265600 26 Great game for passing the time. Doesn't involve a lot of thinking but does want you to place coins in strategic places. Would recommend this game.
A14UX8HGWKRZ3C B00BHHIWQO 5 1375228800 25 Really like this game very few problems, however it has crashed once. Would still install again. Nice that you can play even if  off line.
A14UX8HGWKRZ3C B00DWZ3S90 5 1397001600 21 I really enjoy this game, you can pass the time very easily. Not complicated at all. Defiantly would buy this again.
A14UX8HGWKRZ3C B00GTGSEW0 5 1387238400 33 I really enjoy this game. I like the different levels there is no pressure to by lives and it can  be continuous play. You don't have to wait 30 minutes fir another life..
A14V3BKYYDFZYZ B00G5LQ5MU 5 1391299200 21 Good fun with just enough puzzle elements to keep it interesting.  Fun to play and not too difficult. I recommend it.
A14V3TRR83SZKJ B007PT3QOQ 1 1333929600 48 I don't know how the game plays when it says I have no Internet connection when I have full bars. I also tried the web and the appstore (obviously) and it worked, so its obviously a bug in the app. This makes it unplayable until they fix it.
A14V3TRR83SZKJ B0066T0EVE 4 1333584000 47 This game is good but lacks the polish of the IOS version. it is hard to press on objects to pick them up and it doesn't have an extra gun the IOS version has. if they add that then I would give it a five star review.
A14V3TRR83SZKJ B004VMTI42 4 1339200000 37 Whenever I open a link or log into something it opens 3 more tabs, two of which don't even load stuff. I don't know if its my settings or something but I hope they fix it soon.
A14V3TRR83SZKJ B0086700CM 4 1339200000 38 Great app, but the accelerometer needs to be more responsive on the Kindle Fire, when I hold it upright then it goes to the right and he doesn't turn as responsive as the iPhone app. please fix this.
A14V4SL100M5SI B008OZTIK6 5 1381622400 31 I was trying to find something for my 4yo to working on numbers and math and it turns out that my 2yo also loves it. The whole monkey series is great.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B0064TVQ5E 3 1357776000 26 Wish there were statistics and other simple features.  Every game ends in a &#34;win&#34; and only the time it takes to solve a game is measured.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B004HGK6FW 5 1357776000 25 This game is well thought out and offers stats, levels, history, and is excellent in responding.  I prefer it to ppaper and other online versions.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B005ZISF8Q 5 1370995200 23 Best all-around home magazine in its category in 50 years - D. I. Y., recipes, gardening how tos, and all on a budget.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B00DJ075FQ 1 1400630400 26 I dumped it when it started to play and suddenly it wasn't free!  That's low down and annoying. I can play for free on my laptop.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B0063GORYU 4 1357776000 20 Why does this keep coming up when I click on another app?  If I want to play it, I will.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B0063IH60K 5 1357776000 25 . . . But cards don't need to zip to the suit pile or another column when I click on them.  I'd like a choice.
A14V4ULPC8A7DK B009C7JS14 3 1357776000 23 I'd like to keep 5 locations ready at my fingertips for free.  Only get two and then have to pay . . .
A14V8V39EOTZSF B008AZGWYK 4 1369872000 37 It is just a good as the computer website.  Great practical medical info on many subjects.  Now I don't have to search each medical condition the web - it's all here except for a few less-popular ailments.
A14V8V39EOTZSF B005YH5R7A 4 1379030400 31 It has almost everything and more than you could want.  I would really love audio enhancement so I could listen while resting my eyes, or learn to pronounce the Latin prayers.
A14V8V39EOTZSF B006C4U9RW 2 1365897600 37 I'm still trying to get a stream of music I can tolerate--it seems to be all weird music on this product.The descriptions of the stream selections are weird, yet all the selections I tried sound the same.
A14V8V39EOTZSF B00AKNSOSM 4 1379030400 25 This is a pastime of mine to lighten my mood after reading the news.  However, many of the videos won't load on the Kindle Fire.
A14V8V39EOTZSF B006R8C4U8 4 1369872000 68 I especially love the audio feature.  I wish the prayer section would also include audio.One problem: I use Kindle Fire, and sometimes the site won't load.  Occasionally I can get it to load if I delete the web history; at other times it won't help, so I wait 'til the next day to return.  I wonder if the ap could be upgraded, because it seems to get overloaded.
A14V8V39EOTZSF B007JOA03M 1 1369872000 35 I completed the registration information as requested and then nothing happened.Aparently this ap is for medical professionals only so I removed it from my device.  At least it was free and I didn't lose $.
A14V8V39EOTZSF B00BOW41P8 3 1379030400 38 Many articles are 'different' in perspective than the usual news stories, and are more interesting.  But the free app limits the number of articles you are allowed per month (3), in order to sell you a monthly subscription.
A14VA3B74OI1NQ B004TI2ZXY 4 1356739200 38 I needed a mapping program and I have this on my laptop.  I would prefer a better one....but hey, this was free and it does the basic stuff and for my Kindle that is all I really need.
A14VA3B74OI1NQ B00AQ398AY 4 1357948800 58 I was so excited about getting a Kindle Fire for Christmas that I totally spaced it and forgot about getting some protection for it.  Luckily I hadn't picked up anything yet.....so finally doing my research I came up with this gem....actually read the reviews and was impressed.  I have already suggested it to 3 of my other friends.
A14VA3B74OI1NQ B00ET47USI 4 1405641600 26 Much better than a lot of the other Spider games out there.  The graphics are better and that in itself makes this a much better experience.
A14VA3B74OI1NQ B007FJFDXS 4 1357948800 86 It's nice to be able to sit down and play a mind challenging game for 5 minutes then go on to something else.  This is just the perfect game,not too hard, not too easy.  The opening graphics are crude....but the game board is smooth and polished looking.  This could be done in much higher graphic quality.....and it might be even more fun, but for what it is.....it is good.  Get this one folks for lots of fun without feeling intimidated by bad guys or unsolvable levels.
A14VA3B74OI1NQ B00A7Z8KAU 5 1356739200 50 I have the full blown version of this on my laptop and I love the app to draw, doodle and sketch ideas.  This is much better than just a basic drawing program and it gives me a way to practice some skills in a portable manner!  I highly recommend it!
A14VA3B74OI1NQ B00AFCEIB0 4 1357948800 52 What can I say....It's Google!  This app works every time and I get exactly where I need to go in a hurry.  Some people love Google and some hate it.....pros and cons with any program.  Give this a try and see what you think.  I like it and will continue using it....
A14VADTEIWS9B4 B006MHWXMS 4 1325548800 26 I like this app as much as the next guy. It helps me out with my regular needs like grocery lists and appointments, stuff like that
A14VADTEIWS9B4 B006QZM73Q 4 1326758400 22 this is a message to all u guys who actually put negative reviews.  HUSH I got kindle fire and it works perfectly
A14VADTEIWS9B4 B005QT60PO 5 1359590400 32 This game is truly amazing! I first of all, LOVE flight games/simulators, but this,along with ONE OTHE  GAME, is the best simulator ever,! :D I recommend that you get this game. :)
A14VCKIBY5HX31 B00BNH1PF8 3 1362614400 20 Some are so easy and others are hard. Once you find the answer some of the pictures don't make sense.
A14VCKIBY5HX31 B00CWY76CC 3 1384905600 29 It's a very challenging game. Some levels take awhile. But it's nice just to pass the time. There are 10 levels and more coming soon. Hopefully they'll be good.
A14VCKIBY5HX31 B008JK6W5K 3 1361232000 37 Some of them are hard and some are easy. You get hints once you get so many right.  It's nice that I can play for awhile and then come back later. Your not tied down to it.
A14VDO47T0BO61 B0063IH60K 4 1336262400 29 I enjoy playing this game.  There are many different versions of the game using this app.  If you enjoy solitaire and like variety then you will enjoy this app.
A14VDO47T0BO61 B00B2V66VS 5 1365465600 28 My niece loves this game.  She plays this game for hours and is constantly buying items with the coins she wins to make the game even mire entertaining.
A14VF0MW0KIUVI B00BG3ID0Y 5 1373155200 21 I love this game. It is a little hard but much easier than other ones I tried. But still love it
A14VF0MW0KIUVI B00CWY76CC 4 1373155200 20 It is a very good games makes you really think. It also has good graphics and good for any age
A14VLC7BPL9JR B00BWBHIUG 3 1368144000 122 I am at level 25 and still cannot get my fish...game states a new fish for each rare plant not already grown... not true!!! I absolutely love this game, i have it on my phone as well as my kindle fire, but I am growing weary of planting rare seeds only to get the same plants. I finally grew a rare plant I didn't already have and no new fish. I am embarrassed to say how much money I have spent... so you can imagine my aggravation. I await somebody's reply. the graphics are phenomenal as is the storyline. however the fish take too long to produce just 1 pearl. as I said I love this game.....so PLEASE look into this matter......John.
A14VLC7BPL9JR B00AEWUQG2 3 1374537600 45 so so ...game should't cost stars ... what r u thinking.. start out with say 100,000$then make you wager an X amount. overall concept is pretty cool love b n able to play fb friends !! might wanna rethink &quot;stars&quot; theory...would rate 5 if rethought
A14VLC7BPL9JR B007SYWFRM 4 1382659200 122 i love this game it's a lot like my other fav. game. the graphics are superb... the mini games are kool and the friends section is really great ... the in app purchase is not really required to play so that makes it a plus in my book... and the offline play is just as equally fun... although the expansion of land is a little costly.. but to only have one setback really says alot for the game ... me and my wife are so into this game that we are trying to see who can stay a level up on each other... in short this game gets 4 stars from me... try it  ... you will  not regret it ...  :-)
A14VLC7BPL9JR B00AKJTBL0 5 1360713600 25 excellent game, storyline is cool. just started playing hope it is as good to the end as when i began. i really like the graphics.
A14VLC7BPL9JR B00AA87JGU 3 1375142400 41 what can i say i started the  game and one minute into it the game asks for a rating. so here gos..... it's ok. i don't even  know how to play it yet... but i am gonna give it a try.
A14VLFS1XNQ1EY B006QMYF0W 5 1365638400 24 It has what ir requiere for a solitaire. Its interesting, challenging  and make you have fun. You can spend two hours playing withouth noticing
A14VLFS1XNQ1EY B007N8RULO 1 1365638400 23 There is another spider solitaire much better,. This is boring. When I bought it I thought that was another spider solitaire, not this.
A14VOOOGIF1BS3 B006PJ3UKC 1 1403222400 33 Not much news from this app not with the effort to download it. To me it was worthless. But try it and see if you like it not everyone's tastes are the same.
A14VOOOGIF1BS3 B0063IH60K 2 1380412800 52 not a bad game to play just has to many ads and to many popups. gets aggrevating trying to play and stupid ads popup which there is nothing thst catches my eye to want to nuy. on a scale of 1_10 i would rate it a 3 maybe more like a 2.
A14VOOOGIF1BS3 B00DPGB68G 5 1391644800 53 Very interesting game I love to play it when I have some idle time takes my mind off every day chores etc. Very easy to play and no popups except at the beginning of the game but that is a non issue with me. I would highly recommend it to any age group.
A14VSQ8YR3NQ8J B00DWJBOI8 1 1390867200 40 Tried to play and when I got to a certain point it wants me to unlock the game...that's fine but the picture is messed up and won't let me click on it to unlock it! What a waste of time!
A14VSQ8YR3NQ8J B00I3D27CU 5 1401494400 24 So far a very good game. I enjoy the way it is progressing and the challenging way you have to go about finding items.
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B00A4034W2 5 1359763200 22 This game is a lot of fun and it is awesome and I love it. Good free download for the kindle fire.
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B00AA87JGU 5 1361145600 33 I liked this game. It helped me kill a whole lot of free slow time, and it's free to download. Works real great on the kindle fire. I recomend down loading this app.
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B009C7ZQM4 5 1379894400 29 Get this, it cleans your device super fast and keeps it running great. This rules. I can't believe this was free. I'd give it six stars if I could.
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B009LQ8X58 5 1391990400 32 This really seems to keep my kindle fire running nice and fast. Easy to use,effective, and all kinds of mad cheapness. I would get it if I were you. I mean,why not.
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B00A3E2BVE 5 1369958400 38 I love this. I love music, I love trivia, I've been playing with my wife all day. It's eight o clock pm and I'm just starting dinner, I never am late cause of a game, unroll now. Fun.
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B007P8BMTS 4 1362528000 23 Post your own company that I have any time soon as possible to go kiddo the NoiseGo Or has supernatural and I have
A14VTY3WSZ5MJG B00C7TAF3Y 4 1369180800 42 This is a very good game. I wish it was a little longer cause I wanted to play it more, but at least a second part is going to be coming out apparently. I'll probably buy it if it's longer or cheaper.
A14VWW8PEY4G85 B00DLJ31HQ 5 1375315200 22 This games makes you think and is lots of Fun. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a great family game.
A14VWW8PEY4G85 B00BPC23XO 5 1375401600 20 This games is great fun for the whole family to enjoy. It really gets you thinking. It's loads of fun.
A14VWW8PEY4G85 B00D0VZLVE 5 1375488000 21 I love this game.  It has been loads of fun for me and my husband to play together. Great family game.
A14VX36INPY5X6 B009HUB40Y 1 1401926400 22 There are too many pop up to even try to enjoy the game. No continuity of ply. Just a jumble of ads
A14VX36INPY5X6 B00GDADUPS 1 1388707200 32 It is for a very young group.  Very repetitious and slow.  There are only a few ways it can mix up the bars so they all look alike after a few games.
A14VXYUVTV9YKP B00CF34B2I 1 1389225600 28 The same situation with everyone else who rated 1 star. No storage. Except this time, I have a kindle fire HD! There is no point in this app.
A14VXYUVTV9YKP B008GXHOFW 1 1354665600 42 If this game worked, it would be great, but on my Kindle Fire it is buggy and it will freeze my entire kindle, requiring me to recycle the power on it. Unplayable. Too bad, as this game has a lot of promise.
A14VXYUVTV9YKP B009SDHIPK 1 1357257600 20 Unplayable. Controls didn't work. Messy UI. Don't bother. Waste of time and money. In fact I want my money back.
A14VY1EV3CKVCH B004FRX0MY 5 1396137600 43 The quality of the playback on my Nexus 10 is excellent. It is even better on my bluetooth connected speakers. The player will not only play Amazon bought MP3, but ones which I have gotten from various web sites; things such as presentations.
A14VY1EV3CKVCH B00GRVV29E 5 1396137600 26 It is rather relaxing to just make pretty patterns by using one or more (up to about 6 for me) fingers and watch them swirl around.
A14VY1EV3CKVCH B0055SWM08 5 1322352000 53 The app is really quite easy, for the most part. But it was definitely worth the dollar. Many because it was challenging without being frustrating, like some others are due to my arthritis. Poor motor skills don't really matter. In addition, the music is quite soothing. Not for fans of first person shooters.
A14VY1EV3CKVCH B00FRM93FE 4 1391472000 28 Some of the puzzles are quite difficult. To be honest, I had to cheat by watching the YouTube video to see how to find some of the treasures.
A14VY1EV3CKVCH B009RLG7RI 5 1396915200 106 I am staying up _way_ too late playing this. I keep thinking, just one more round! The game has two portions. The first reminds me a bit of Candy Crush in that you must align the same objects in order to have them disappear and give you points. One you have cleared the level, you use the points to create housing and other things such as trees (important for happy settlers), a market place (once it become availabe), a tavern (when available), and other structures (castle, light house, ... depending on the village).Again, it is very fun and addicting. Even to an old man like me.
A14VY1EV3CKVCH B00CBT4F3G 5 1396137600 45 I really enjoy playing this. I even replay scenarios that I've already &#34;won&#34;. The only minus is that it appears that this is only a teaser for the full SteamOS game. I only play games on my Android tablet. Oh, well, so much for that.
A14VY9PWD7FHV6 B00E5GJ7QS 4 1404000000 26 Great game, fast paced and entertaining. Easy for all ages to play . Great for just using as a distraction for my kids when they're bored
A14VY9PWD7FHV6 B00AMEFZ72 4 1404086400 27 The game play is fun and great for all ages. Perfect for when you have to kill some time due to the short duration of each match
A14VY9PWD7FHV6 B00HHAAWX6 4 1405209600 131 Love the game just wish there was a way to get the red crystals more quickly without purchasing them and the purple, blue and green crystals as well. I do like the level of the challenges in the quests and the fact that unlike most games, you really have to put forth a level of effort to acquire the supplies needed for the buildings in the quests. All in all, a great game with a fun and interesting storyline. Has also worked as a wonderful incentive as a reward for the special needs children I work with. They love getting to play it and see the changes that quickly document their efforts in game on tablets we have for them to use. Keep up the good work and the great games!
A14W3Y3HVF3233 B006JPS1OM 5 1326067200 28 I downloaded this game to my kindle fire and it takes FOREVER to load I'm giving it 5 stars because I have played it before an love it.
A14W3Y3HVF3233 B00599ZRSC 5 1326585600 27 I was not exspecting THIS AMAZING game I thought it would be lame but turns out I was wrong I say every one should get this app!!!!!!!!
A14W3Y3HVF3233 B004HM35RC 1 1325548800 25 I wouldn't download this app it wont download when you try I have a brand new kindle fire and it froze in tell it died!
A14W4WW8NAE27W B007ZGO7EM 5 1355356800 34 I like it is just a basic calculator.  Ads and subtracts and divides and can figure percentages.  I had a lot of trouble with percentages in school, so this fits the bill for me.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B006GECE9Y 1 1357948800 28 Cam can't open flash player can't download dolphin.  amazo in their short sightednesd will not. Support flash player.  Dolphin does but amazon won't allow you to get. It
A14W4WW8NAE27W B00A04GA14 3 1354060800 59 Have not had time to try it yet.  I'm not a real big gammer bought the kindle more for the reader it is and the ability to keep track of emails.  Tried the game for a minute late last night and looks like it will help with hand/eye coordination. And seems entertaining enough to keep me interested for awhile.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B004LOMB2Q 5 1354060800 82 I was pleasantly surprised to see this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I love the app on the smart phone, hope it works as well on Kindle.  Only draw back I can see right now is the fact that with my phone I can include a picture with a particular note.  I suppose I can still do that only will have to import a picture from the Amazon Cloud first.  Looking forward to a lot of good use from this app.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B004TI2ZXY 5 1354060800 57 I have only had this app a couple of days so far but looks good.  I tried it on a simple test to a store in town and it plotted the course perfectly and quickly.  Using on Kinkle Fire HD don't know how it will work in car with no wifi available I'll have try that latter.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B0063IH60K 5 1354060800 31 Saw this app on my Kindle Fire HD and I like to play solitaire. It helps me relax and unwind at night and helps kill time in Doctors office waiting room.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B0064X7FVE 4 1354060800 49 I never liked this app on my smartphone, but really like it on the Kindle Fire HD.  Primary reason is the small screen on smart phone could never appreciate all this app can do.  Keeps track of current conditions as well as forcasts, and a lot of interesting features.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B0094BB4TW 4 1354406400 44 It is a facebook app that does what it was designed to do.  I am not a big fan of facebook but seems like you have to be today to keep up with everyone else or they look at you like an old fish.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B0065AFQSU 5 1354060800 40 Great app does exactly what I want.  Keeps me up on the score and playing times. Ern has a live feature if I can't watch a game on TV or listen on radio. I can still keep track of plays.
A14W4WW8NAE27W B004VMUS9G 5 1360627200 24 Not a lot of frills, just the features you need in an alarm clock.  Easy to set up and works great with Kindle Fire
A14W5LX19SL7EV B00CDBLC8S 1 1374537600 27 Its not a good game I don't like it it's really boring I don't love it or like it I'm happy you don't need to pay for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
A14W5LX19SL7EV B009HV8ULE 3 1359244800 45 I downloaded it cause it looked fun . It was, but the characters for the game were a lot of coins.. Or whatever they were,,,,, plus it takes real money to purchase stuff,,,,, just like every other game . Oh well...... people gotta make money.somehow......
A14W9BPI39A25E B007NZV2HK 4 1357171200 21 My wife got this game for her ipod she said she likes the game, thats all i know about this game
