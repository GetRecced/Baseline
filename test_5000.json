{"asin":"B00INC0ENU","overall":1,"reviewText":"This game is amazing, it is so much fun, and quite entertaining. But the reason I'm giving it one star is because of the HUGE scam this game pulls off.First of all, you get energy to play, despite being a 3.99 game you have to pay 1.00 to keep playing after your energy runs out.Secondly, the card limit, seriously? You make a game, then give the person a 60 card limit. Then charge 1.00 to increase that limit by a measly 5 cards? DO you have a mental disease or something.Thirdly, you charge 3.00 to get a card that might not even bee good yes that's right 1 miserable card.But to be honest the above doesn't even matter to me. I would have rated this game 5 stars even with all of these flaws. The thing that really pushed me over the edge is that the application suddenly disappeared. It just &hellip;&quot;vanished&quot; from my kindle. So I 're downloaded it. I opened the app and had found out that all my progress had been deleted. Seriously f this and f the developer. I had already beat all the story mode missions and spent over 100$ on gems and for you to bend me over and f me is just ludicrous. So without further ado. Do not BUY this app if you don't want to get f-ed over by amateur developers who don't know the meaning of a cloud save button. Heck even candy crush has a autosave via Facebook login .","reviewerID":"A03271321M5A7N65UWYJU","unixReviewTime":1404000000}

Then, penquins, Yeti monsters, eagles, wolves, and I have just reached a level that calls bats up!  Oh, I forgot the jet snowmobile!Yes, you earn coins and can spend them at the in game store, but what else to do with them?I, am having a blast with this game and grandchildren love it also!You will not be disappointed with this game app!  Also, since it changes and has three different mountain slopes it doesn't get boring very quickly, since it is never the same play!I , say buy it if you have to, get a chance to get it as FAOD, put it on your phone or tablet, and I mean on each one you can.If, I need to purchase anything in this app with real money I haven't seen it yet !!!!!I would and I normally don't do that!!!!!!  I play on my kindle fire, and it works great besides looking fantastic!!!  I, quickly got addicted to this game!

For example, 8 Ball requires you to call your shot, so tap the ball you plan to pocket and tap the pocket you are aiming for.  This will put a circle around the ball and the hole.The AI acts just like a real person.  It is fun to play against the computer.  I think the physics are just fine. The sounds of the balls colliding is very realistic.  To add to the experience, there are background sounds; soft jazz piano and people talking, as though you were at a bar.

Since then, the game has DRASTICALLY changed. Umpteen updates later and the game still has much to be desired.  Graphics are cute, but food is quickly eaten, limitations on obtaining gems, and its hard to visit all my friends, while keeping up my red star rating.Ive also been told that the iPad\/iPod version is beautiful and has much more added features, items and quests.  I am disappointed to hear this as I use the Android version.Every update changes the gameplay and every other update affects the notifications.  Currently my game crashes 2-3 times an hour and I no longer receive any notifications, even though the options are all checked in my settings.if this were fixed, along with the oddly suspicious permissions, it would be a five star.","reviewerID":"A10CYODHZSO9O7","unixReviewTime":1330819200}

Even if you don't know the answer, you can figure it out because the other two answers are stupidly impossible.  For instance, the question \"This is a garden with a large collection of trees and shrubs\" has the possible answers \"Tuber\", \"Alternate Host\", and \"Arboretum\".  Really?The glossary is just row after row of definitions, no illustrations or other insight.The \"news\" button does nothing but point your web browser to Google.On my Motorola Xoom tablet, there is vast amounts of wasted space.  Most of the quiz questions and flashcards take up 1\/4 to 1\/2 of the screen.Some of the images were missing and replaced with a ? symbol.  Was this app even tested?This app offers absolutely nothing that might actually benefit a gardener such planting time tables, weed or insect identification, weather charts, soil amendments, or anything else.

You can even record the growth of your \"baby bump\".Unfortunately, there are also a number of issues.  The first problem that has put a number of people off this app is that once you input your name, age and sex, it doesn't appear to let you do anything.  You have to press the small button in the upper left that looks like a scale with feet.  That is apparently the home button.  It would be nice if there were something pointing this out, as it has no label.The app defaults to measuring your height in feet and inches, but your weight in kilograms, an odd combination.  The units can only be changed by going into Manage Users and selecting Edit User.  This has to be done for each person who uses the app.On my tablet, everything is small and there is a ton of wasted space.  The calendar, for instance, only takes up little more than 1\/2 the screen.While the app does have the ability to export to a file, it lacks a cloud synchronization feature.

There wasn't an option to skip it.Then to make matters worse, there is the stupid Teacher.  In the old version, it didn't automatically tell you what you could do on every single turn.  In this version, it does.  I know what you're thinking, \"If you read the directions, you'd know you can turn it off.\"  Well guess what?  I did read the directions.  \"Tap on the Teacher to turn it on\/off.\"  Well I tapped and the stupid thing won't shut off.  Tried every turn, no good.

Do you carry board games around with you all day? And how about a paper calendar &amp; a pen to keep your schedule? If you do, then you can take that smart phone right back to the store, because you clearly don't qualify to own one.I sure hope brain transplant research is progressing rapidly so we can take the brains from those who don't use them &amp; transplant them to those who will!As for the app:This is quite a powerful list app and I highly recommend taking the time to read the directions before you dismiss it. The notes have several customizable fields. It's not a one-time checklist. You can clear all the checks at once &amp; reuse a list. You can copy items (called notes in this app) to multiple lists and edits will change all of the lists.Yes, I know these features exist because I read the directions! Some things are too complicated to be intuitive. That's why directions exist.

I've used other readers in the past but this one is just so reliable. It does have \"pinch to zoom\" on the Fire, maybe I have later version than the ones being reviewed and it works great. You can turn off the page turn feature while you're zoomed in so you don't accidentally turn the page while scanning around which is VERY useful...just tap the page to go back to normal & VOILA, tap to go to the next page. It renders the pages instantaneously with no lag, you can just zip right along with no quirky hiccups or stutters. The developers also continue to update the app for Fire which is a HUGE plus!

{"asin":"B009XFDFPU","overall":5,"reviewText":"After seeing all of the negative reviews about Facebook integration I almost didn't install the app because I was expecting it to be like candy crush and most other matching jewel games that have nag screens trying to MAKE me login to social media sites and try to make you ask friends for help to get to the next level but it was nothing like that at all. The only time I see anything about Facebook or Twitter is when you win a trophy at the end of the level it asks if you want to share the trophy or continue to the next level, BIG DEAL! If you click no  you continue to the next level as usual. I have not gone out of my way looking for anymore Facebook or Twitter content on the game so if there is anything else it must be discrete enough and not all in your face because after playing the game for quite a while now I haven't noticed anything so far, and i haven't had to connect any accounts or been offered anything like extra points or coins to do so.The object of the game is simple, the little tutorials or tips help you understand what you need to know to play the game. The object of the game is to free any brown squares by getting 3 balls in a row, the further you go the more brown squares there are, and after a while you'll have certain squares you need to free more than once. It progresses very smoothly so it doesn't get too hard too fast, &amp; it gives you plenty of time and moves to complete the level. If you can't complete the level it gives you the option to restart or skip the level. The graphics are nice, there's no annoying background music, &amp; I haven't noticed anything else that might be annoying that usually stands out in these types of games. There is no lagging and it seems like the developers made it properly because it doesn't take up a whole bunch of space on your device. I think it's a good game to play when you need to take some time out of your day to unwind and relax.","reviewerID":"A10OEBNZKX48KU","unixReviewTime":1398643200}

The pictures are pretty, you can choose which music melody to listen to, and the hidden pictures you are looking for are the same type of picture in each level (butterflies, ladybugs, etc,) so there's no list you have to keep track of and there's not a bunch of nonsense hidden items like most of these apps have. It tells you what to look for and it shows how many are left to find. I think the pictures are just easy enough to find so that it's not annoying and when you get down to having to find the last picture it'll give you a hint if you choose to use it.A popup will show up for a second if you randomly touch the screen over and over in the same area but it goes away after a second so it's really not a bigdeal and I've only saw the popup when I tried to make it popup to see what ppl were talking about. The pictures aren't that hard to find so it's not really necessary to have to repeatedly tap the screen over and over in the same area, maybe it's different on smaller phones.","reviewerID":"A10OEBNZKX48KU","unixReviewTime":1377561600}

{"asin":"B00A8ECU24","overall":3,"reviewText":"First of all, gems are way too expensive and it's far too easy to accidentally spend them. Princess Celestia would cost about $75 if you were to fork out real money for gems to buy her! I don't recommend playing the game when you are tired because it's far too easy to waste gems: when you are tapping to collect coins, it is easy to accidentally tap a building and tap the button to skip the wait, and then you have three less gems and got your coins thirty seconds faster. I am only slightly bitter.The social thing does seem to work very well. I keep hearing about this button to visit random farms, but I've yet to find it. And even though I have about twenty friends on Gameloft who are playing MLP, only two show up on my in-game friends list. Several quests require you to visit friends, or receive hearts or treasure chests from friends, so the social part of the game needs to actually work, or there goes another few gems to skip those quests. I am not a fan of Gameloft's business model.Other than that, I really enjoy playing this. I enjoy the minigames, as repetitive as they are, and the game where everypony straps on wings and goes flying to collect bits (coins) and white rainclouds is really fun. I like rearranging my Ponyville as I build more and unlock more land. I like that you can tap on trees and bushes and haystacks to get a few extra coins, and searching for Derpy in her box is fun.I just wish the social aspects of the game actually worked and that it was possible to bypass spending lots of real money on gems to complete the game. I get that that's why the game is free and that Gameloft needs to make a profit, but when the target audience is young girls, it seems almost criminal. I can only imagine how many parents don't have in-app purchases disabled and get a nasty surprise when they open their credit card statement or phone bill...","reviewerID":"A10REK3XHCU8HT","unixReviewTime":1358726400}

I have yet to find anything glitchy about it if that's a concern.

Best to sign up w\/GameLoft to make friends to get acorns and hearts which are necessary to buy things in the game and make goals.Update -- I had to drop a couple of stars because of the poor customer service relating to the game. It has been several months since I've been able to visit my friends and send them gifts -- and this is an integral part of the game!! -- and emails to customer service have been promptly answered and courteous... but ultimately have done nothing. It's probably been 5 months since I've received any acorns from any of my friends, and I was previously getting 30+ gifts per day. Not being able to receive acorns really hampers the fun of the game; in order to advance you just have to rely on luck to get one acorn a week, or leave the game on all day long wasting your battery to get snow piles to hope for one acorn a day (and with most of the animals costing 100+ acorns at the higher levels of the game, you see how long it would take to get a new animal!).Anyway, it's a fun game to play as long as you can receive gifts from your friends; but after nearly six months of IAV not being able to get its act together for this vital part of the game, that makes the game almost no fun at all, and it almost seems as if they're intentionally not fixing this \"glitch\" so that you'll have to buy the acorns using real money.

Looks like it could be fun but I personally am not into games making you pay each time you want to play especially when they're unoriginal.I hope eventually games like this go out of style and they make a city building game that you can sit and play for hours without needing to pay to speed things up or advanced.But it's free at first so I'll give it 2 stars.","reviewerID":"A10UVNJ49TENUA","unixReviewTime":1396051200}

It's the kind of game that is just challenging enough, but in a very relaxing way.  I don't like very hard games that leave me feeling frustrated.  I usually stop playing those kind of games and just delete the app from my Kindle Fire. The graphics are beautiful and it has a cultural aspect and feel because of the maps, artifacts and geographical references. I'm very glad I picked up this app when it was offered for free.

{"asin":"B00632HWOG","overall":4,"reviewText":"I've tried using other email apps on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" for my Yahoo! account, but they lack in functionality in comparison to the \"Real McCoy.\"  One crucial function that trumps all other apps is its send\/receive speed.  When you're chatting with someone by email, time is of the essence.  I have sound and display notifications set up for my Yahoo account, and when tested side by side with about five other email apps, Yahoo! always notifies me immediately of the email.  Also, the ability to just swipe from the left and access the other folders (such as Sent) that are synced with my Yahoo! account is another time-saving feature.  The only reason I'm not giving it a full five stars is because of the default small size print.  I have not found a way within the app's settings to permanently set the print to a larger size.  You can change the size every time you write an email, but I find that annoying.  Also, I would like the ability to change the background to black with white text (a lot easier on the eyes). Lastly, when I hit the Return key after I've created my subject line (because the space is so small before the signature line) the app closes out to the Kindle Fire's homescreen. Otherwise, this app is the best I've found for ease of use with my Yahoo! account.","reviewerID":"A10WXBKRSDRKSZ","unixReviewTime":1373155200}

You start out with a good variety of puzzles and then you can get more.I was worried when I first got this that I would get done with the puzzles they gave me and be bored with it but when I finally decided to check out the get more puzzles option , which is right there for you, I found there are even more puzzle categories you can get for free yea free. Each category comes with 3-5 different puzzles too. Now there are also a lot of categories that they want money for but some I checked out were only $.99 and had 9-12 different puzzles in the category and you can preview the category without buying if you don't like what you see or if your just not ready to buy. I seen reviews when I got this that people were having trouble with their puzzles disappearing so I haven't bought any yet I've just been busy enough with all the free ones still but if I do buy any ill make sure I do those as soon as possible so if they do disappear I hopefully will already have completed them.UPDATE: I am still playing this for free and loving it I play all the time when I'm not busy or if I'm waiting for appointments. I've gotten over 50 puzzles so far I have deleted the ones I don't want to do again but I haven't had any disappear on me without deleting them. I am considering buying a set of 60 in one for $1.99 but I have to admit that the reason I haven't yet is because of the reviews saying that one's they paid for disappear but I think I'm going to try it anyway I'm hoping the update that did that to the other reviewers fixed that so it won't happen again. If not 60 puzzles should keep me busy for another month or so and if they do happen to disappear it's only two bucks it's worth the test I  guess lol.I will be sure to let everyone know how it goes in another update, it might be a month or two before I update again to be sure of the results (sooner if they do disappear ;) )","reviewerID":"A110KV2T5LVMRD","unixReviewTime":1362009600}

As long as you have internet access it is easy to play for quite awhile once you learn how to use your friends and collections to help you get experience points and energy to ply and advance. At First it seemed to me that I couldn't play that long because of the energy and it does allow you to pay to get more but I didn't have much to spend and thought I wasn't going to be keeping the game long.  Once I figured out how to get friends and started getting online more it became easier to play longer and learn strategy to keep going without paying for the gems. Now I can play for hours and not even realize how long I've been glued to it until my energy is depleted and I decide it's time to let it recharge.

Of course they give you free money and allow you to buy more coins if you so desire.  The only thing I don't like much is each time you go back into the game it gives you the highest bet possible.  Once or twice was playing my little heart out until it tells me I'm out of money.  How can that be?  I forgot to check and change the bet level upon entering this game.  It is a good wake-up call.

{"asin":"B00GSZEBE2","overall":4,"reviewText":"[reviewed version 1.1.2 on Kindle Fire HDX 7]You're the personnel manager on the Death Star, tasked by the Emperor himself (and overseen by Darth Vader, of course) to harness the power of Capitalism.  You add levels one at a time, choosing from residential, recreational, food service, retail, service, and official Imperial levels.  Each type has a myriad of different specific examples, like The Cantina, Cloud City Spa, Holochess Hall, and Tatooine Apartments.  The graphics are retro 8-bit style, but you can tell they sort of look like familiar characters and scenes.  And the 8-bit low-resolution graphics are probably fine on a phone.  It looks pretty retro on a tablet, but it's Star Wars.  The music is similarly retro, not just because it's the Star Wars theme, but because it sounds like a MIDI &#34;chip tune&#34; from around the time the original trilogy came out.  Let's face it, that original trilogy is pretty &#34;retro&#34; itself now, so that's not inappropriate.Each residential level can house 5 &#34;bitizens&#34; of various species and specialties.  Each has a skill level in each type of job and one &#34;dream job&#34;.  Each recreational, service, food, or retail level can employ up to three bitizens and performs better the higher their skills for that type of job are.  There are additional bonuses for managing to assign someone their dream job, which is a specific instance of a type of job they're good at, but you might not have yet.  The work levels can have as many different products or services in stock as they have employees, and you have to tap the level and product to order it when they run out, then tap it again to start selling it when it's stocked.  The specific products are predetermined by the specific level with no detailed choices of what to stock.When you're not managing workforces and inventories, you run the elevator.  Bitizens arrive in the lobby and tell you what level they want to go to.  You hold the up or down buttons until the elevator reaches their desired floor.  I know this was supposed to be a long time ago, but really?  Manual elevator controls?  On a space station?  Yeah, that's one of the game's primary activities.  You even get to spend Imperial Bux to upgrade to a faster elevator as you stack up more levels to deliver people to.The Emperor assigns you quests, like building another level of a specific type, fully stocking some level, building a specific Imperial level and sending supply officers there to build some new device, or just exploring the interface, to make sure you didn't miss the cash shop.  Yes, there are in-app purchases to speed things up, buy specific levels, outfits for bitizens, all the usual stuff.  It's pretty easy to ignore, though.From time to time, a random event pops up, rewarding you for  locating and tapping on a specific bitizen.  You probably won't remember their names, or what level they live and work on, but there's a picture provided, so just scroll until you see them wandering around and tap that level.  Sometimes, it's even a rebel spy you have to find and some excitement breaks out.  There are little movie clips of such things recorded in an album you can access later.Occasionally, a VIP appears in your elevator, and you can choose to hold them in the lobby or deliver them immediately to some level.  VIPs have special effects, like the Recruiting Officer who can fill up one of your residential levels all at once, the Supply Officer who delivers special hardware for Imperial projects, and the Celebrity who drastically increases sales in whatever level you deliver them to.  Characters from the movies also make appearances from time to time, unlocking their bios in the album.The Imperial levels produce a variety of sinister devices for nefarious purposes, as ordered by Lord Vader.  You'll be told (via hologram, of course) what is needed and rewarded for producing the required quantities of the specified items.  Each level only produces one thing, so it's basically just a matter of waiting for a Supply Officer to show up and delivering them to the proper level.The game keeps running after you exit, and it notifies you if you need to restock or reorder something.  The bitizens will go about their business selling their goods and services to each other without you, so you'll have some more credits and more work waiting for you when you return.  My Kindle Fire HDX 7 doesn't seem to take much of a performance hit from this background process, but personally, I find the game too needy.  I can't leave it running and do anything else for more than a couple minutes without a droid beeping at me to go restock blue milk or something.The only advertising is for its own cash shop, and that's minimal.  It doesn't beg to be connected to social media.  It doesn't nag you to upgrade.  It does notify when something needs attention, but only once each time you're away.  You can just ignore that notification and it won't remind you again until you come back and leave again.All in all, it's a decent game of its type, but this type of game just doesn't hold my attention very long.  The elevator and restocking mechanics are tedious, and that's most of the game.  It's cute, and it avoids most of the usual annoyances, but it's just not interesting for very long.","reviewerID":"A116ZSMZRT9RUN","unixReviewTime":1398124800}
{"asin":"B00E3OUQ5S","overall":2,"reviewText":"[Reviewed on Kindle Fire HDX 7]\"Build\" a gun by connecting the \"barrel\" and \"crosshairs\" and \"trigger\" blocks with generic cubes on a small grid.  Aim your device at blocks that form some kind of target range and tap to shoot and get points for shooting more  points worth of blocks than your opponent, and bonus points for shooting bonus blocks.  The aiming is actually kinda neat.  It measures the angle you're holding the device, so you just turn and tilt it to aim, then tap as fast as you can to shoot, and drag to reload.  Basically, the faster you tap, the more points you get, and I don't like beating up my Kindle like that.  Oh, and then there's the \"farm\".  If you have a seed, you can plant it in the ground _inside_ your house and a coin tree grows.  Come back later and shoot it for points.  You can get the seed by gambling those points on a spinning block that gives you points, seeds, or nothing, depending on which side stops when you shoot.That's it.  You can't even get very creative with your gun designs if you want them to be effective.  You have to choose between dead average performance or performance determined by how well you adhere to the normal, average pattern, like the one shown on the icon.Oh, and there's ads.  Rather a lot of ads.  You can claim some free points by opening the cash shop and seeing what bonus packages are for sale.  You can challenge other players to shoot stuff with, but be prepared to be totally outmatched if you haven't bought those upgrades and\/or spent hundreds of hours tapping like a woodpecker on crack.","reviewerID":"A116ZSMZRT9RUN","unixReviewTime":1393027200}

The controls a just fine, at least they are on a 10&quot; tablet.  I can see how a game like this would be impossible to play on a phone.  Also, the money thing is completely pointless.  It would be nice to have some kind of tournament set up or something that would keep you going.  All in all it's probably worth the 99 cents, but if the dev just spent a little more time adding some minor features to keep the player interested, it would be a winner.  All in all, this game has good mechanics and good graphics, but no sense of progression to keep me interested.

(let us not call names, shall we).If you love to read, then definitely give this app a try. It's a free app, taking you to free* items you love, so what's the risk? Easy to use, takes the hassle out of searching amazon for free books and to me, the offerings are more when checked daily anyway.(varied from day-day).* prices are subject to be changed without notice so they warn us to check the price before buying. I don't find this a problem because an author might offer a book free to attract readers for a short time then start charging for it later.

In this great first-person shooter game, you're the commando who is getting payback for the loss of some of your fellow soldiers.  The gameplay is pretty straight forward.  Point and shoot.  The only problems I had with the game, which seems to be a trend in Glu games, is that the fire button and weapon selection buttons are to close together.  It's easy to hit the wrong one at a bad time and end up missing a shot or getting killed.  The movement controls can be a bit difficult at times.  I have been hit with grenades and missiles numerous times because it would not move when I asked it to.  Also, it is very difficult to play the game without spending real money to upgrade your weapons.

{"asin":"B00BOUROR2","overall":5,"reviewText":"This app is great for many reasons. First, the price is great for all you get. You get something like ten or eleven, or more types of games of solitaire to choose from to play. Each individual game has a set of directions on how to play it, written out. Also, there is a link to YouTube that shows you how to play each individual game if you need more information\/help with how to play that game.You choose the type of card deck face you want to play with, and what the back of the card looks like. It gives a limited amount of each: 2 types of card facing to choose, and 3 back card design to choose. But this, to me, is great. It's more than any of this quality of game does for such a low price. And who cares what your cards look like anyway? I think it was nice that the game provider thought of this as a nice little extra. What is really great, and makes up for the limited choice of card decks, are the numerous beautiful backgrounds you get to choose to play on. Like Niagara Falls, beautiful mountains of several majestic auras, beaches at sunset, a winter scene that makes you want to walk through, etc. There are something like ten or so backgrounds to choose from.Lastly, the game controls move effortlessly and you can tell that the programmer took time, as well as pride, in this game. It is a good quality game for the whole family to enjoy. I play this more than ANY other app I have, and I have a LOT OF APPS. Try this app out.

This is a good starter Mahjong for the beginners, but ALSO an old love and time passer for others.The graphics and controls on this game have been flawless, and trust me, I have been playing it A LOT!!! LOL!!!What I think is great about this app is also that you get to pick between 3 different sets of tiles to use, select one of several stunningly beautiful backgrounds, and choose your layout you want to use. This app gives you many layouts to choose from such as the shape of a turtle, a smiley face, a crab, crowns, a helicopter, a dog, etc., and THAT'S NOT EVEN THE FIRST PAGE OF LAYOUTS!!!!For just 99&cent;, for all you get, is just awesome!!! Try it out, I think everyone should enjoy it......and it's only 99&cent;!!!!!!!By the way, this company also puts out an &quot;All In One Solataire&quot; app that is just off the charts great for the price!!!!! There are like 10 or more different types of Solataire within the app and it gives you a &quot;how to&quot; play with each different one. And if you still need help, they have a link to YouTube for each type of Solataire, that shows you how to play them. But the games are fairly easy and the written directions have been very helpful.

I'm not great at video games by any definition, but I was able to operate this with a little practice.  I've had this app now for about 5 days and have earned over 700 coins and can now fly Air Force One. Still can't land it very well, but that's what makes you come back for more.  The camera button gives you 3 different visual perspectives and be sure to watch that altimeter.  No sense in going much higher than 1000 or so feet up as the missions are fairly quick and you'll just have to come back down again. Be sure to look at the tutorial before flying your first mission too as it offers good tips on how to land.  I haven't had the need to use my earned coins yet to purchase additional missions and you can unlock many planes by merely watching a you tube videio or posting a review.

{"asin":"B005EI48SI","overall":4,"reviewText":"First off, all these negative reviews seem to be from people that didn't even play the game once. Posting reviews without really checking out a game or app does not help things at all. It's just as bad as a developer posing as a customer. One thing that I like about the Android Market is that you cannot post without buying or installing something.Back to my review. I got this as the free app of the day. It installed fine on my EVO 3D and it plays perfectly. The game renders very smoothly, the sound is very soothing, there was no need to calibrate anything. The story is in Chinese (I think) so I was not able to follow. No big deal. The menus have English and there was no guessing in order to play. It's a rolling ball, not brain surgery.Now, would I buy this for $2? Probably not. It's just not my usual game. If it were a dollar, maybe. If you are a fan of Super Monkey Ball, maze games, marble rolling games, etc, this is probably a good fit for your handheld device.All the permissions that people are complaining about seem to be used for feint. Personally, I think feint is just stupid. I could care less about posting scores and whatever else it does. I simply choose not to use it on games that have it integrated.This is not a bad game at all and is definitely worth checking out. Even though it isn't my usual game, I'm not uninstalling. I'll probably play once in a while.","reviewerID":"A11EJ2HFWMAAFL","unixReviewTime":1319760000}

Eliminating frustration from not winning a game costs money for more moves and\/or a special tool to help win the game.  I refuse to purchase anything other than the ability to move to the next level.  I would much prefer to pay for a game and not have to deal with the nickel and diming than get the game for free.  Had I known this upfront, I would not have purchased the game.  I would prefer the makers of the game to reward the player for a game well played rather than only having the option to spend money.

{"asin":"B006RXD2I6","overall":4,"reviewText":"My husband downloaded this game, and I love it. The game is free and has a ton of games.One note: I wouldn't really consider this to be 250+ games, as several of the games are simply variations of other games (1 card draw Klondike vs. 3 card draw Klondike, and another two variations for limited redeals vs. unlimited redeals). However, there are a large number of games, certainly more than I'm likely to play, and I've found several that are really fun.In addition, you have the option to change some settings. I found one game that was almost identical to one that I've played in the past, except that it had limited redeals. I just went into the game settings, chose &#34;unlimited redeals&#34; and the game became the version I wanted. Very nice.One con: some of the rules can be difficult to figure out just from reading them. However, you can usually easily figure out what is going on by using the &#34;Show Available Moves&#34; button, or by using the feature that allows you to watch an actual game being played.This game is free because it is ad-supported. The ads are small and unobtrusive.However, I soon realized that if I shut off my wireless connection and THEN open this game, there are no ads because the ad software cannot reach the internet. Nice for playing, but I feel bad that the developer is not getting any income for his work when I do that. But I usually have wireless turned off to prevent my children from accessing the web on my Kindle Fire, so am not likely to change that just for one app.I would gladly PAY for an ad-free version of this app, as the time I've spent playing has been very enjoyable.","reviewerID":"A11GBDVXJSTXSX","unixReviewTime":1369612800}

{"asin":"B005YFNC92","overall":4,"reviewText":"I am a long-time subscriber to the Wall Street Journal paper and digital edition.  Before that I used to get the Kindle version on my Kindle Keyboard, but switched because the Digital Edition gives you access on more devices than the Kindle Edition does.  I use it on my computer, my Android phone, and sometimes even read the physical \"dead tree\" edition.  When we got a Kindle Fire on its first available day, I was disappointed that there wasn't a WSJ application for it, and actually didn't think that there ever would be, since Amazon has the competing product in the form of the Kindle Edition to the paper.Anyway, the WSJ Application did finally become available in the Amazon Application Store a few days ago, and I have mixed feelings about it.  On one hand, I'm really happy that this was finally made available and am pleased with the layout and look of it.  My problem is that navigation on the Fire in this application is awful.  I have never had a problem navigating through the paper on the old Android version of the WSJ app on my Motorola Triumph phone, or using the regular old Kindle version.  On the Kindle Fire, navigation in the WSJ application is very frustrating.  I constantly have articles randomly return to the first page, midway through.  Also, the screen sensitivity seems to vary as you are reading the application.  You'll try to click on a link to a story and nothing will happen to the third try or so.  Other times, you will barely bring your finger near the screen, and it will start changing your page or taking you to a different article.  Changing the screen orientation while reading, even if for just a second, also causes this application to do very weird things, like returning to the first page of the article you are in, or moving you to a completely different article.  Something is terribly wrong with the implementation of this application on Fire.  I wish they just made the regular Android version from the Google Android Store available through the Amazon Application Store.Hopefully a newer version of this application will correct these problems or will give customers of running it in regular Android mode.I would have given this application less than 4 stars, but based on all the other positive reviews, and the baseless-ness of many of the 1 star reviews, I didn't want to take a chance in flaming this application if these problems are only effecting me for some reason.  I don't think that is the case, because my Kindle Fire works fine with everything else we do with it, but I certainly don't want to dissuade people from trying this app for themselves. Please just look out for these issues, and if you have them also, please post a comment or review, so the WSJ app team can be made more aware of it.\/\/\/\/Update on January 19th, 2012\/\/\/\/I've been using this for a while, now on my Kindle Fire and been pretty happy with it.  90% of the time it works well.  I have noticed that uninstalling it and reinstalling it occasionally makes the \"freezing\" issue go away for a few weeks.  Obviously, you shouldn't have to do that, but it only takes a minute or two and really does solve the bugs, albeit temporarily, so far.","reviewerID":"A11I1I9QLMAM1A","unixReviewTime":1323648000}

I've never had a problem with it working correctly on any of my devices, including the Kindle Fire.My issue is that their song library seems to be shrinking.  My playlists all seem to result in a lot of repetition.  For me, the whole point of Pandora is to be exposed to new music that is similar to the music that I already like.

Even if the protagonist is the same, the games are distinctly different. Gravity Guy requires much quicker reflexes, making it more difficult. In Jetpack Joyride, the Gravity Suit lasts until you get hit, so there's more margin for error.

{"asin":"B004DM1ZQY","overall":4,"reviewText":"This game HAD to have been programmed by someone who has never played backgammon. Opening rolls are about the only thing that follows what you might expect.  There are times it will hit every possible blot, and then other times, will not hit a blot that would be to it's advantage. The end game is ridiculous. The program wants to want to move all men to the home point FIRST - even if there are men that could be taken off a higher point. Unless I play with the doubling cube, I can easily beat the program 98% of the time at the top level. Graphics are very good, the game keeps better statistics statistics, the available moves are highlighted, and even the sound of the men 'shooshing' as they are moved are all pluses.In comparison to the Compulab game on my Kindle keyboard, no contest!But I wanted Backgammon for the Fire HD.....................Three months later.I am much more satisfied with the HD backgammon at this point. There is the feature that allows you to \"undo\" a move, because the touch screen can be somewhat sensitive. But you can \"undo\" all the way back to the beginning. I'll do that to see if a specific move was where the game fell apart. I still find the end game irritating. The statistics allow you to look at how many spaces could be moved, and the number of doubles in the game.

You simply match the letter tile to the given letter space to spell the word, which is then pronounced for you.At first I saw little difference between the two and three star levels-They appeared to be the same. However, when I made a mistake the difference was marked. On the two star level you can move the tiles around until you get the answer correct. On the three star level you are stuck with your mistake until all tiles are used, then you have to replay the incorrect ones. It's just annoying enough to force you to be more careful.As for the app overall, the sound stopped suddenly during play and I had to back out to the level selection screen to get it back.Fifty words is probably good for three or four sessions of play for my 5-yr-old. I think he'll be bored with the repitition after that.

Most machines have between 5 to 8 sounds.  If you like the sound, good, but most often there the sound isn't realistic... or there is that one hooting owl or seagulls that makes the loop stand out. This app not only has good sound, it allows you to customize and layer the sounds.  My favorite creation is one I call Cozy Fireside.  I start with a kitten purr, add the grandfather clock,  rain, and the crackle of a fire in the fireplace.  You can also adjust the loudness of each element until you get the perfect blend. You can save and name your mixes and set the timer.  The app is free and awesome so go ahead and download it.","reviewerID":"A11QYNXLFT3XVY","unixReviewTime":1398211200}
{"asin":"B00E83G68K","overall":2,"reviewText":"This app has cute animation, but grows old quickly.  You are allowed to download certain Muppets, starting with Animal and Ralph and going on from there.  You level up your Muppets by feeding them. (First you have to wait for the concession stand to cook the food) Once they reach level 4, you can start mixing Muppets to get other Muppets. This may take awhile.  If you don't want to wait, you can pay real money to hurry things up... But before you pull out your Visa, go to the &amp;#34;friend&amp;#34; icon and visit the stage of you automated game friend.  His stage is already set up so you can see what you are working for.  My advice is just pretend his screen is your screen and save yourself time and money.  All the characters are there doing their little thing.  They are still singing the same song..... over and over and over. In the end, you will have invested time and money to decide to put Miss Piggy on the right side of the stage instead of the left the way the autofriend has.  And to keep everyone happy, you have to buy them stuff... and they have to have their stuff up on stage with them while they preform... a speech podium for Sam the eagle, a log and swamp for Kermit, etc.  You would think they would leave it in the dressing rooms considering how much money you spent to upgrade them. Of course I'm only assuming they were upgraded. I never actually saw the dressing rooms. I just clicked on the door with the gold star on it and upgraded whenever a post-it note from Scooter demanded I needed to upgrade. It's kind of like paying taxes... you throw you money at it and hope everything works out.  In the end, unless you just adore autofriend's stage, this game won't last long before the repeating song drives you nuts and you dictate Animal's mouth.  They include that option.","reviewerID":"A11QYNXLFT3XVY","unixReviewTime":1396915200}

The variable options of sound, rotating the board, moving against the clock or think time of 5\/10\/15\/30 minutes choice could be designated for the time between each player's moves. The board has a clean and easy to view based on the design of it. I will hold onto the game despite the other reviews of hearing a check when it couldn't be possible or some other minor objecitons. The game will pan out for me or my option will be to seek another chess game by removing this one.

{"asin":"B004SD5GZ4","overall":5,"reviewText":"I wasn't sure after reading all the reviews, whether I would have issues with this app or maybe it was addressed at this point of time. I have a Kindle Fire HD so I don't know how it works with any other device. Compatibility would have to be tried or information from Amazon to mention it. I clicked on the pdf file on my email, which contained an ebook file and after a few seconds, I got the Adobe Reader prompt letting me know to click on it from the Kindle screen. It was on the Adobe, and I named it, so I could keep that separate from another pdf file on it. This other pdf file was the Adobe instuction pdf file to help someone load files on it from their device's browser or emails. That file explained graphically with arrows and verbage, what needed to be done with the pdf files depending on any placement use of it. I will give this app time, and I do have a Adobe Reader on my PC, so I am somewhat comfortable on the few uses I have done with it. This type of reader is needed with certain circumstances where a pdf file sent to someone or information stored to use at a later point of time.

{"asin":"B005V20JKI","overall":5,"reviewText":"This is such a fun game. For being free it gets an extra thumbs up. So let's get done to the controls. They are very little but even with my huge fingers it worked just fine. The characters being switched via the collectable muffins is a good way to keep you from getting used to just one characters. The level system is good for those who want to go to the next level that way. The character  upgrades ate available for leveling up and you'll want to make sure you do use them because they do make the difference between life and death. The characters them selves are also very different from one another which is definitely a upside unless you don't want a challenge. Overall rating for the game is a 9.2\/10. With the great amount of characters and levels this is a great game. Although be forewarned don't buy this wanting a super challenge or you'll probably be little let down. But even whether you're a hardcore or casual gamer you'll have fun with this game.

{"asin":"B008XAKC98","overall":3,"reviewText":"I installed this app because I expected to watch movies on my Kindle Fire and have some fun with it, but it did not work as I thought it would. First thing I have to say is that, at least this time, this new version of the the app was installed on my kindle without any trouble and did not crash at start-up, as former versions usually did. Then, I was able to login into my account without any difficulty and I began to browse the app's content. The interface is very easy to use and the available selection of movies, though not optimal, is acceptable (unlike the selection of TV Shows), but it lacks of a content search option, which is annoying when trying to find something quickly.On another respect, the quality of the streaming is also acceptable and, in general, one can enjoy a film or a show without any complications. However, it is not always like that, since in many instances, the streaming stops unexpectedly, after 20 or 30 minutes from having started watching a show or a movie, and although the app offers a RESUME option, this feature not always works properly, so one is forced to start over again. Anyhow, one can also use the slider control on the player to search for the place where the film had stopped.Finally, the audio experience improves a lot by using headphones instead of Kindle's speakers, since these latter are low quality.","reviewerID":"A120Y6UVSINR36","unixReviewTime":1363824000}

I experimented a bit more. and found I could make a call to one long distance number (it was a good quality connection). So the long distance call was free but they want a prepaid account to make the local call. This is not what they advertised. I checked reviews and found many complaints similar to mine. This may actually be a good deal. But I'm afraid to find out. They have not accurately represented their product in their advertising with respect to the the free app, so why should I expect anything different with respect to the paid contract? No thank you.

My niece can barely sit still for 5 minutes but when she is involved in these learning games, she gets absorbed in it and is entertained for a long time.  The games reinforce things she has been learning at home but in a different, fun & creative way.  She loves popping the bubbles and hearing the praise from the voice on the game when she gets the answer right or completes a level.  I think her favorite is the animal one where she touches the animal in the bubble and hears the sound the animal makes, but she is very interested in the letter games, too.  The colors game is great--it even includes the color gray.  As usual, the colors, music and animation are awesome and entertaining.

{"asin":"B0073LWEXK","overall":5,"reviewText":"I got \"The Lost City\" for free as the FAOTD (free app of the day) exactly 1 year ago, but I never played it... as I was playing other games on my phone at the time.  I eventually forgot about it after I upgraded my phone and forgot to reinstall the app.  I came back to the game shortly after completingThe Adventures of Mosaika, another FAOTD on Nov 29th.Simply put, this game is a point & touch graphical puzzle game.  If any of you played Myst or 7th Guest back in the 90s on PC, this is pretty much the same type of game.  I have played other types of puzzle games on my phone but have often deleted them due to a lack of interest because of \"hidden\" objects that make the puzzle games extremely frustrating.The thing I like about Fire Maple Games' products is that the puzzles are really straightforward if you think hard enough.  There is a a lot of backtracking but the hint system is there to help you in case you get stuck.  I had to use it a few times in this game and after the solution was provided to me, I felt so stupid.Graphically, the game is very well done with nice animations, sound effects, and music.In my opinion, \"The Lost City\" was much harder than \"The Adventures of Mosaika\" due to the numerous backtracking you had to do, but it was still fun nevertheless.Very fun game.  So fun in fact, I'm considering buying their original game,The Secret of Grisly Manor.","reviewerID":"A12B7ZMXFI6IXY","unixReviewTime":1386633600}

I love horror games because I think getting myself worked up & being scared is almost as fun as playing the game itself. This game is exactly that. I'll admit that the other reviews of the game probably overhyped what I was going to expect, but bottom line this game gave me about an hour of fun. The graphics are very well done and the ominous sound effects are a nice touch. While playing, I recommend playing with all the options on & play on the night setting. This really helps set the mood along with the sound effects. Playing with all the options off & playing in the day setting makes it not scary at all. Half the fun is getting chased when you see the silhouette of Slender Man in the distance. Replay value is somewhat short though, that's the only downside.","reviewerID":"A12B7ZMXFI6IXY","unixReviewTime":1363046400}

I'm usually pretty good at solving puzzles, but this game had some puzzles that I didn't find intuitive at all.  On more than one occasion, I had to resort to the youtube walk-through to find a puzzle solution.  Even then, I didn't always see how you could have intuitively figured it out.

You can also make multiple lists, so you can have a list for each store, if you want.Cons: If you don't have an internet connection when the system sleeps your checked off items are unchecked. It is difficult to create a store flow. You use arrow keys and you can only move one space at a time. The FAQ's say on the iphone the process is easier.

In each level a &#34;spirit&#34; would fade in and then fade back out but these appearances were always VERY obvious.  The designer did not ask my advice on how to develop this but if he or she had asked me, I would have recommended that the spirits had been a lot less obvious and that their appearance had been extremely brief.  The deal would be that if you saw the spirit and clicked on it quickly before it disappeared again, you would somehow be rewarded, like maybe be given additional levels that those who did not click on the spirit would even see and the more spirits you clicked on the more extra levels you would have been given.

{"asin":"B0071PS7AC","overall":4,"reviewText":"In order to play and win, you have to work within the physics of the game. It is NOT real bowling, but only similar to it. You can spin your ball so it 'hooks' into the pins, but if you start in the wrong place, your ball will gutter.I have beaten my opponent in all my games, with scores from 160 to 267, but only by understanding game limitations. For example, you cannot aim your ball to angle across the lane. Rather you can roll a straight ball (no spin) or a hook (varied spin) which will hit the pins directly down the lane from where you roll the ball from. So if you roll from the middle, your ball will hit in the middle, with the amount of spin, or no spin, that you release it with.The real limitations of the game are that 1) there is no natural way to aim the ball, it only goes toward the point exactly opposite from where it is dropped, 2) you cannot pull up your scores from previous games, or the current scoreboard for that matter (it only shows between frames), 3) you cannot play against other human players or online opponents, and 4) as mentioned by another reviewer, you cannot track averages or have things like tournaments and special events.It is a nicely done app for what it is, but could use some good user experience QA to make it more real instead of just a time consumer.

One of my favorite features about this app is that the content you have updated is available even if you are not connected to WiFi. You cannot get updated content, obviously, but you can read the last round of story updates you got.

The frustrating thing is that you only get 5 lives and have to buy or ask friends for more.  Getting them from friends works pretty well, but you can only accept one at a time, from what I can see, instead of letting them accumulate.  But the worst part is that you can't earn &quot;power-ups&quot; (for lack of a better term).  Instead, you have to actually purchase them with real money.

The new Coffee Table format makes playing with other people great fun and really provides a \"board game replacement\" feeling.  Because of this, I now give the game 5 stars even though the AI may be somewhat lacking.They now include full dice roll statistics, I assume to quell the many reviews that indicate some AI cheating was going on.  I have not played enough games yet to say whether the AI still cheats, but I would point out that just because it keeps dice rolls within statistical norms doesn't mean it isn't still picking the best landing spot on each roll.  The one game against the AI I have played on the new version I owned everything on the board on both sides of \"Go\" and it was quite amazing how the AI managed to repeatedly land on none of them and actually make a profit of over $1000 using cards and repeated trips around the board, all whilst having only 8 total properties of it's own...OLD REVIEW: The trade interface is a complete disaster.

That's fine; I'll count it as a win anyway.However, I tried to play it on an airplane last week and was informed that it needs an internet connection to work. WHAT?!?! My kindle does not have service, so I use my hotspot - which is not always on. I've never gotten this message before. I get that Open Feint needs a connection, but does anyone actually care about it? This is a paid app that I was looking forward to entertaining myself with on my flights. Add an out, devs!","reviewerID":"A12NIMGZ4LWUU8","unixReviewTime":1380153600}

I thought it was a collection of clips from the series, but it's actually a rather difficult hidden object-type game. Objects to be found show up in a top corner but may not be on screen for longer than a split second, and the picture is pretty pixelated, so it's difficult to tell what a lot of the objects are supposed to be.

I wouldn't have even noticed it if it hadn't popped up as a free ap. I like it on my older Kindle Fire because it tells me which aps are using battery power and what percentage. You do have to select advanced and then usage. On my 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD the usage just takes you to the device page. I'm uninstalling it on the Fire HD. The AP doesn't do a lot. One reviewer complained about the BAT\/AC\/USB that is under the battery on the page when you open the ap and says that the AC and USB don't work. If you plug the kindle in to AC, the AC lights up. So I guess that tells you that it's connected to AC. Barely worth the time to install. It does seem from other reviews and putting it on 2 devices that the features don't work the same on all devices.

However this was not much of a problem as I simply clicked quickly on each of the choices until it gave me credit for the right answer. It was great fun solving the mystery but only took 30 minutes to play and for this reason I will not be purchasing either of the sequels.

This game doesn't seem to know what direction it wants to go in. It is like Farmville in the sense that you have to wait for crops, animals and buildings to be harvested. You have to have the right supplies to build various stages of your buildings. BUT then you also need to use energy. So on top of having to wait for things to be ready, you have to wait for the energy to do it when it is ready.There is no smooth integration with Social Media, so when I finally broke down and tried to link my FB, it just force closed. Every time I have tried to \"ask friends\" for specific building materials to be able to move on, it force closes.Also, the screen is extremely sensitive which stinks when you have limited amounts of energy. I was trying to scroll and accidentally clicked a tree.

{"asin":"B004ALVL6W","overall":1,"reviewText":"First, it's great news that this app by Maribou does not contain unnecessary permissions, as did another app of theirs a couple of weeks ago.  However, why this developer keeps cranking out game apps that can't be moved to the external SD card remains a mystery and a concern. Yes, it's only a MB in size, and I can fit this app and a whole team of Clydesdale horses in my phone's internals, but for some folks, this will become an issue during app \"spring cleaning,\" and apps like this will be the first to go.Second, wish I would have known the app has no sounds so I didn't have to spend time fiddling with phone settings, thinking it was my settings.Third, with all the same complaints about the power stations over at Google Market, you would think the developers would rethink the app and take them out.  They don't HAVE to -- it's THEIR game.  But if they want to make it OUR game on our devices and charge for it, they would be wise to just redesign it and give the people what they're begging for!  They should take the complaints about the towers for what they really are:  FREE development strategy advice being handed to them on a silver platter!Fourth, the gameplay.  Sadly, it is indeed laggy as many have reported, and coupled with the frustration of the towers, it's just not providing any fun.  If the towers are necessary to provide the energy, they shouldn't be so expensive.  I'm just not sure lowering their price is going to satisfy those who already have developed a distaste for their existence to begin with and, hence, not be the solution to end the complaints.Maribou may want to to take this app back to the drawing board and make these changes... or not.  Depends on whether they want to stay competitive in at least the tower defense market.  And if their ultimate goal is to have customers download multiple apps they create, then for heaven's sake -- let them go to the SD card to attract some non-rooted customers and those who are vigilant as to what they feel is necessary and important enough to take up precious phone space.","reviewerID":"A12YPVJ4WG8N2C","unixReviewTime":1331424000}

{"asin":"B008HSOT18","overall":3,"reviewText":"I downloaded this app for my grandson to play as we travel, as well as to have a 'quiet time' activity for him. The multi-level skills of the opponents were an added benefit. I installed this on a 8\" Android 2.3 Gingerbread tablet. Several games ran to completion with no issues, but at random 3 out of the first 10 or 12 games we attempted froze or locked up, and we couldn't finish the game - one required a device power shutdown in order to unfreeze the tablet. I debated between a 2 or 3 star rating (I wish Amazon would allow half-star ratings!) - it was a toss-up between the ratings, but when the game worked, it is a much better featured game than almost all the competition, so I generously gave it a 3. I am looking forward to any upgrades or improvements in future versions, and will not hesitate in trying future versions.","reviewerID":"A12ZXJPQNRP7PT","unixReviewTime":1346889600}

Even though you aren't playing against others, the setup and clarity far outshine similar games. Because of this, i have given this app five stars. But this is not to say I have no complaints. Once you've unlocked more levels, it becomes harder and harder to earn enough coins to continue unlocking levels given the amount of credits you are given each day. Unless, of course, you spend real money. There have also been a few technical issues that have cost me well over 50 credits, none of which were returned even after contacting technical support. Still, comparatively speaking, this game is worth it.","reviewerID":"A13009KI5LAKNI","unixReviewTime":1362873600}

If you only have one or two species, its not bad, but when you have four or more different types of animals, it takes forever to care for them.Since you can only hold so much in your inventory, every time you care for one species, you have to (1)get items from storage room. (2) use items to care for that species (3) take out the trash (4) return items to storage. Not to mention, you have to get water from the well and check the health of each pet.So when you have three hamsters, three gerbils and three rabbits, you have to go through this whole process each time. So far, my daughter doesn't have any horses or snakes yet.So if you're looking for a game that takes much of your time, this is it. But if you want a game where you dont have to constantly play in order to keep your pets alive...find a different one.

It has great instructions accompanied by a tutorial, so I was able to catch on quickly. It is so much fun! And there are so many levels it's really unbelievable.I upgraded gladly and really got into the &quot;swing&quot; of things. You can play this game without spending any money buying anything else although you have that option. The game gives you rewards if you play well that you can buy powerups with. The sound effects are cute and the graphics are great, as with all Big Fish games. My only complaint is that this game is very addictive!!!Since buying this, I have gotten several other solitaire games, but only &quot;Emerland&quot; can match this one in quality although it is a bit shorter. I only wish there were more solitaire games from Big Fish!!!","reviewerID":"A1314P8MTIGN5J","unixReviewTime":1391990400}
{"asin":"B00BUB9JDW","overall":5,"reviewText":"I haven't had this much fun since Wonderlines, Fishdom and Treasures of Montezuma 3!!! This is a match 3 with a wonderful new twist - you bomb the balls\/pearls sitting in a variety of containers with those of like colors that you point and drop from a crane-like device at the top of the screen. The catch is that the ground on which the balls lie is different on each level. It can be bumpy or curvy AND there are differently shaped sides on the containers, some concave, some a series of platforms at different levels that overlap that send balls flying to places you can't predict. The containers also have obstacles like platforms, wheels, teeter-totters and inverted horseshoes that deflect and ricochet the balls everywhere but where you want them to go, sort of like upright pinball, pool and marbles. When 3 balls of like color meet, they dissolve. The goal of each level is to annihilate all the balls (Pearls), or to annihilate all the balls with something in them...starfish, shells, seahorses, stars etc. Really beautiful little graphics.You should know up front that you can spend real$$$ buying play gold coins with which you can buy powerups and the ability to open up different \"Worlds\" of play BUT you can ALSO earn coins by playing in the zen mode and in the other modes, too. It's a little slower than buying them from the App Store, but it's up to you. You can earn 10 coins a day playing on zen mode, so in 15 days, you can progress to the next level on the regular mode which costs 150 coins. You can also earn coins on each level of the regular game according to speed and accuracy. Each level has a ton of play. Each \"WORLD\" has between 15 and 18 levels. Between Zen mode and winning coins on the regular levels, I have accumulated enough to move to World 2 which costs 150 coins. But, I have not bought ANY powerups. Powerups cost anywhere from 5 to 10 to 50 coins and do various things like take out a whole row of balls, a bouncing bomb, one takes out like colors, one moves your ball up a level, etc. You can buy bags of gold play coins for .99$ to 9.99 for 1500, which would keep you going for a good while.Of course, I'd rather pay $2 or $5 bucks for the app and not have to buy coins...but, still, it's so much fun and you do have the option not to buy coins, I really don't mind...There are full page ads you have to close occsionally, but they won't kill you.While this is called a physics-based game and makes you use your brain, it is a super-fun, new concept for match-3 lovers (like me!), and made all the more special by great mini-games every couple of levels that can earn you coins. A wonderful game with gorgeous graphics and mellow, soothing plinking glass sound effects and music and smooth, very accurate, responsive play - where you touch the screen is where the ball is going to fall (not necessarily where it's going to end up :-)). This is in the upper, upper tier of games for concept, graphics, music and interesting play and I'm so glad to have found it. I would give it more stars if I could.","reviewerID":"A1314P8MTIGN5J","unixReviewTime":1370390400}

I thing I could give this game 4 stars and maybe 5 but I'm only 1\/4 through so this what I've found thus far:1.  The object find areas are not well lit and can not be enlarged.  Certain items can only be found using the hint option.2. Although the design and progression of the game seems readily apparent, there are a few surprises and variations that keep you anticipating what will be next.3. The interface seems sluggish to respond in a few areas making movement difficult.  Also, in several game areas you can not back up without using the small 'back Button' placed in the lower right hand corner.  It is small and cumbersome to use when in other areas a simple touch of the bottom of the screen will do.  ( I'm excluding going up to and backing away from puzzles which require one to use the back button.)4.

{"asin":"B00EQ0CKRQ","overall":5,"reviewText":"Pros: This game is so well put together with such good graphics that it&#8217;s amazing the developers can afford to give it away for free.  There are so many racetracks to play, different levels of several different cars - it feels like the Kindle version of Need for Speed, and a good one at that, complete with music you&#8217;ve actually heard of for a soundtrack.Cons: I&#8217;m not quite sure, but I think it may have charged me for downloading additional content right after I downloaded the game.  It asks you first, though, so you can always opt out, but I had a 0.99 charge on my card after downloading some free apps, and I&#8217;m pretty sure this additional DLC was the culprit.  Though, considering it was a huge amount of data, 0.99 wasn&#8217;t a bad deal.","reviewerID":"A136MAOWGCU2C2","unixReviewTime":1396483200}

{"asin":"B004OZOTSQ","overall":5,"reviewText":"Overall: Basically, in a nutshell, this app allows you to connect and download from\/upload to your tablet without a cord. It also allows you to delete files, change file names, simply everything you can do when you hook it up to the computer. Really useful if you, well, don't want to connect your tablet to the PC physically. Honestly though, this can be handy if say, you want to keep using your tablet while uploading a large file to it from the computer. The way the app works is that you open the app and then access the tablet file system through your web browser on your computer using an address that the app provides. Pretty simple, even for the technologically challenged. And the whole thing happens through your WiFi network. I was a little concerned about having difficulties at work; However, I was successful during my first attempt with zero troubleshooting. Very nice!Pros: First of all, I have used a couple others of these so called `USB Thumb Drive' apps and this one is definitely the best. It works well every time, over pretty much any network. This app is extremely useful because my tablet's physical connection basically prevents any use of the tablet when hooked up via USB. The app keeps running in the background, so all you have to do is set up an operation (upload\/download) and then you keep using the tablet as normal. A password can be set up to access the webapp, which is a very nice feature.Cons: Webapp interface is slightly slow and will keep you waiting almost as if you were using dial up (not good if you are impatient). Visually speaking, the web interface is not as pretty as some of this app's competitors. Uploading is performed using a very antiquated system in my opinion. It seems that in this world of HTML 5 and Java powered upload tools, one could be added.Most Useful Feature: Downloading from the device is dead simple. In fact, it is the only action that requires a single mouse click from your browser. Simply locate the file you want, click it and it begins downloading to your computer immediately.","reviewerID":"A13DS6M8DB90YP","unixReviewTime":1337904000}

When you really need a hit, you get a strike out.  When it doesn't matter at all, you hit a home run.  They also added a bunch of extra junk that has nothing to do with baseball.
