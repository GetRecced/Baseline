I had been using theBosch 20-CA Clear Advantage Beam Wiper Blade - 20\"- a pair of them - prior to switching out for these.Both products offer excellent windshield wiping 'clear vision' without squeaks or streaking, which makes both products winners in my book.  However the Bosch is my choice over these ACDelco ones.Why?Well, the ACDelco 20ACD Clear Vision Wiper Blades sit up higher (have a higher profile) than the Bosch ones.  That means that when the wipers are on, I see them in my peripheral vision more than I'd like.  It didn't seem like a big deal at first, and I thought I'd get past it, but the more I used them, the more distracting it became.The blades come with 4 adapters and 'not great' instructions, but they're easy to install and work well. For the price I wanted to like them as well as the previous (Bosch) brand, and I didn't.The wear indicator is a nice feature if it works, but like the 'maintenance' light on my car that goes off automatically when it thinks I'm due for an oil change - it's a suggestion.In the case of wiper blades, if it's still working - I'll still use it! We all use things differently and in the case with wipers, in different environments.  For example a car that has these wipers and is driven on the coast where the air is salty and wet, should have a much faster wear on the blades than someone in a non-salty environment.  Just like a car left in the hot sun for months out of the year versus being garaged, would have a different wear on their wipers.Overall, these are top notch blades with a slightly elevated list price.  They are easy to install, but may be taller than you'd like when compared to other brands.  If they were the same price as another brand I like I still wouldn't get them because the fit on my car isn't what I like.However, the product is a good one in terms of function, and you truly won't know if they are right for your car until you try them.  Unless your car is a 2003 Toyota 4Runner and in that case - skip it.","reviewerID":"A12DQZKRKTNF5E","unixReviewTime":1358121600}

This allows for a variety of materials to be used and accounted for. Other cover clips such as the ones that my brother has are made of a rubbery type of material, and consist of a circle with an inner circle that \"snaps\" in to hold the material. I italicized the snaps because the plastic is flexible enough to consider it being squished in instead. These Pro Grips are made of tough hard plastic. You could flatten a dime with these suckers. :-) Ok that is an exaggeration but you get the idea, they are made of tough hard plastic and should give you a lot of years of use.The other thing worth mentioning is the multilayer serrated teeth that make up the teeth. With about a whole one eighth of an inch opening or more this enables you to multi-fold the material that it is holding, or to be able to supplement the material with a secondary material designed to protect your tarp. The footprint is smaller however, but when you consider how small a grommet is which is the customary method for securing tarps these things are huge.With the closed ring on the back, something you can easily tie a cord onto, or use a rubber tie down with that makes these all the more desirable. The ones my brother has and is using over his classic Miata right now only have a half loop, with one side open. Considering how soft the material is that is a much weaker system than these Pro Grips have with as they put it \"Prehistoric holding power\".So that about sums it up. I find the convenience, holding power, and adjust ability to accommodate different types of material the shining stars on these tarp clips. The face or mouth could be even larger but the existing size will suffice for most jobs. Highly recommended.","reviewerID":"A14JBDSWKPKTZA","unixReviewTime":1342569600}

{"asin":"B000JFJLP6","overall":5,"reviewText":"I wanted to explain how I decided to purchase this Jump-n-Pack so my review is long Sorry!I have used many Jump Packs & all have worked OK in the past until I purchased a Larger Diesel Truck that is. This truck is a Mitsubishi FE140 with a 4Cyl Turbo Diesel engine. It has two Batteries & we have two inverters, a fridge etc that run of the truck.One day we was shopping but when we returned to the truck no start because we left lights on OOPs. Now the store we were at had a normal Name Brand Jump Pack like you see in most stores. Unfortunately it didn't work at all.So we called roadside Assistance which was to say the least an adventure.1. After over two hours of waiting & mis-communications a nice guy in a Honda that was barely running showed up. I was literally laughing as he pulled up with his little yellow light on the roof. His car was barely running. All he had was a smaller Clore Jump-n-Carry which didn't do any better than the other one we tried earlier. He gave up eventually2. Roadside Assistance Apologized & said they would send a more appropriate vendor to jump our truck.3. Next a truck larger than ours showed up so now Im thinking we are in good hands. Well he had a direct connection plug to use his truck to jump us which did work but not before trying for 30 minutes.So after all this my BoyScout side said I would never be left in this situation again so I researched many Jump Packs on the web. Finally finding the Clore JNC660 which had a few reviews about it jumping even Larger Tractors which have multiple batteries. I decided I had nothing to loose so I purchased it during a Xmas Lightning deal thinking how is this Jump Pack going to work on our truck being this inexpensive. I purchased knowing Amazon would back it up & also thinking I could use it on our boat if nothing else.I also made sure I was getting the newer model based on some reviews saying they didn't receive the updated model. At first all seemed well so I didn't get to test it out since I wasn't going to run batteries down purposely. Finally there was a day it happened the truck didn't start because something ran the batteries down. So I pulled the Jump-n-Pack out thinking I hope this works.First of all it had nice long reach cables which was awesome since all others I have owned or tried had very short cables that required holding the jump pack up over batteries. Next I hooked it up went to cab tried to start & it fired up almost instantly to my amazement.I have now had to use the Jump-n-Pack multiple times on this truck because the Fridge was running batteries down very fast due to defect. The Jump-n-Pack has not failed one time & has had to jump this truck not only once on a charge but 4 times in same day.I know it is It is just a simple Jump Pack but it does the job so well all my vehicles will have one soon.Update 08\/19\/2013:I have been using this for quite awhile now & it has never let me down yet. I have used it to boost my Fuso Turbo Diesel truck multiple times, Our Land Rover, Lawn Mower as well as our Boat. I will purchase a backup second one when Amazon puts it on sale again.Now there is one negative to mention. After using it quite a few times I have noticed the cables getting skinned from the way it winds them up. I have found you must take extra care to wind it up just right to prevent this from happening.Update 09\/12\/2013Today Amazon put this on sale again so true to my word I have purchased a second one.I also wanted to add to my review I recently had to replace both batteries on my Truck because they both had dead cells.

{"asin":"B0014Y82UQ","overall":4,"reviewText":"I just put these in my old hauler hatchback for large shopping runs. I didn't expect this to be a good time to review them because it wasn't supposed to rain for a while. Out of the blue, though, we had a couple of storms so I have been able to test them in the wet.These replaced a set of old fashioned multi-part wipers. I already have a couple of other modern one piece style wipers on other vehicles.The wiper was a tad longer than the one it replaced and bumped the other wiper blade when I snapped the arm back down onto the glass from installing. I don't think it will be a long term problem though.Installation was dead simple. The supplied extra clip was not needed for my Mazda vehicle, and there are no convoluted instructions to puzzle or hinged parts to get it to lock in place and stay on. I have had nightmare wipers in the past and these were really simple to install.These wipers worked very well, leaving no creases on the window, though they do remove water quickly and get noisy fast once the windscreen is dry.  I tried them after spraying the windshield with a watering can to see how they work when there is a lot of water involved. The wipers stood up to a pretty heavy load of water being dumped on the windscreen.Right now being the near the end of a hot spring we have a ton of pollen falling off of trees and blowing around. So overnight we have a fine sprinkling on the windshield which catches the sunlight and makes it hard to see. So despite it not being a typical rain season the wipers are still needed on a daily basis. They work a treat at removing the pollen off the windshield.Overall I like them and they work well. They aren't the most attractive though; some other ones have more streamlined covers for the clip fastener area for example but they work well and are very easy to install. I didn't notice any whistle wind noise traveling at speed which I had noticed with other wipers.Hopefully these will last the hot summer and see me through next winter. Not bad at all.","reviewerID":"A16ALXKQ02SKYG","unixReviewTime":1367971200}

This was the first time I had used a snow broom type product.  The best part of the product is that the head is very large and allows fast clearance of snow by pushing and pulling motion.  It also did not damage the paint on my vehicle.  The telescoping pole feature works fine and does not collapse back onto itself when using.  The head does come loose from the pole occasionally, but that may be technique related.  The head unscrews and clips onto the pole for storage.  The ice scraper part is just typical, nothing special.  What I don't like is the overall size\/bulkiness of the product.  It takes up a huge amount of space in my trunk, vs. a typical snow brush.  Thus, I have gone back to using my trusty snowbrush and separate ice scraper.

With tandem wheels the best way seems to put a spreader style lock between the tires. I have had a pair of this style for quite a while. They were the style that you adjusted them, then placed them between the tires and pulled a lever up while trying to keep the bottom from coming up, I did this with an old wrench holding the bottom down. With two bad shoulders this was getting to be a dreadful experience. Finally they were just too rusted and I just couldn't keep them adjusted.I have had my eye on this style for a while but thought they were expensive. Well I finally took the leap and I am happy I did. They are easy to put between the tires and crank them tight. My trailer is more stable now than ever before. I did buy two of them and a wrench came with each so I have a spare. The box wrench has two different sizes, one on each end. It is also a ratcheting wrench. So I marked the end that fits the device and also marked the wrench for which side to be up to put them on and which side to be up to take them off. This set up is so much easier! Suppose you could buy the cheaper set but I like the way these press and fit on the tires.Wish I would of bought these sooner.Update: We have used these on several trips now.

The blade contours well to the windshield, no missed spots, no chatter.The wear indicator seems to be a small colored dot that changes color over time, not really a \"wear\" indicator, but an indicator for the lengths of time the wiper is exposed to the elements. Perhaps this blade lasts so long they want to remind you to buy another set?The downside of this particular blade is the adapter. It is big, bulky, and overly complex. I am glad they post the video online because the instructions may not be clear.The install of the proper clip is fairly easy, but there are too many parts in the box, no indication as to what needs to be used together, and it is difficult to identify the proper orientation for the clip to be installed.I use what I thought was the most popular u curve slide in clip. The adapter for that type on this blade is very large. Most wipers I have used have a very low profile for this type, the u curve slides easily into the main connector. But on this blade you have to add a bulky tower connector and the u curve attaches there.If you have a blade that slides down into a hidden area, I wonder if there might be some clearance issues.

I had e-mailed telling me 1oz per quart of capacity.  Figured I would then put the rest in my wife's Accord.  Temp is actually higher !  I e-mailed rep back and here is what he said :I'm sorry that you having noticed a temperature drop as of yet, but Purple Ice will not cause an increase in operating temperature.  Was this vehicle running hot to begin with?  If so, was the root cause investigated?No radiator additive will cause an a thermostatically controlled cooling system to run consistently colder than the thermostat set-point.  The thermostat is there to help the engine warm up quickly be restricting coolant flow until the coolant reaches a certain temperature.  That is its function.  If the coolant goes below that set-point the thermostat closes and the coolant begins to increase in temperature until the t-stat opens again.If you were not having overheating problems, why did you purchase and use a product that is intended to alleviate overheating problems?  The product works as exactly advertised.  If you would like the vehicle to run colder that the current t-stat set-point you may try installing a cooler t-stat.  Purple Ice will help you vehicle achieve this lower temperature after the mechanical restrictions to such an end are removed.In my opinion FALSE ADVERTISING and a SNAKE OIL product BEWARE.","reviewerID":"A18FOZ2W81QI45","unixReviewTime":1304467200}
{"asin":"B00ATXEIVU","overall":3,"reviewText":"ENERGIZER 120W Cup Inverter is perfect for most needs as long as you are aware of the power output limitations. Remember even-though it has one 120V AC socket does not mean that you can plug anything you want and expect it to run. In my tests I found out that hardware engineers at ENERGIZER has given considerable amount of thoughts with 'safety & protection' in mind when designing this product. In most cases 'over-estimating' the load momentarily causing  the DC & AC outputs to cut-off while in operation. Having said, It does work perfectly when you keep the load on the device well below the limits of 120 watts.Also, as there are no physical ON\/OFF switch for this CUP inverter, embedded smart electronics in the device constantly monitors the load & will change the bi-color status LED from Blue to RED indicating overload. I found that the USB ports current draw & the 120 watt inverter share the same 'overload' logic. This can be a problem in some situations wherein the 120v A\/C load may draw little bit above the rated limit thereby momentarily shutting off the USB ports. Once the overloading device is removed the unit will automatically start working. While this design keeps the user & device safe during operation it can add some inconvenience inadvertently when the user without knowledge adds a device which overloads the device.PROS[+] Silent Operation[+] Good safety protection[+] Small design with 4 USB ports[+] Includes Battery Clips[+] Smart power draw (Draws power only when load is detected)CONS[-] Bright Blue Light is a distraction while driving.[-] The shape & design of the cup inverter can be problem in some cars as it tends to fall out.[-] The overload circuit is common for both USB and 120v inverter cutting off USB output at times.[-] If you plug-in all four USB ports for charging it would take long time to charge the devices as they are shared.Side-note:Not having a Physical ON\/OFF switch is not a deal breaker for me. But worth mentioning as it can be a problem in some cars wherein the cigarette lighter port does not power off when key is removed as it might drain the car battery if left unattended with a large load. Without any load however the device draws negligible current &lt;20mA and can be left connected to the car's cigarette lighter port.I really like this product apart from the limited power of 120 watts.

However, it is important to remember that it is essentially a giant battery and NOT a generator.One of my complaints is that the unit has a built in monitoring device that provides feedback on the amount of remaining power in the battery. Unfortunately, that feature did not work on mine. I am not sure if my unit is defective... but the display console is essentially useless.PROS-- Will power a cordless phone, modem and router for about 8 hours. We have our phone service through the internet - so when our power is out we lose everything.- It can charge your car battery... in a pinch. I haven't tried it yet, but I am sure that if your car battery wasn't all the way dead the Duracell Powerpack could get you going!- Nice built in flash light and radio. Not of huge use - but in the dark they are nice to have.- Surge protector on the unit - things that pull too much juice will not even come on (like my wife's hair dryer)Cons-- VERY HEAVY - I haven't weighed it but the Duracell Powerpack probably tips the scale at about 25-30lbs. Any many cases it would be too heavy for a women or the elderly.- It is severely limited in the number of amps that you can pull. Again, my wife's hair dryer pulled to many amos - and therefore - would not come on. This severely restricts its use during a power outage. As a rule of thumb only low powered appliances can be plugged in.At the end of the day - for the cost - you could throw in a little more money and buy a generator. While the Duracell Powerpack is silent and does not produces any dangerous fumes it is limited in what you can operate.

{"asin":"B005JU5VUK","overall":5,"reviewText":"I've had these on my car for a little over a year and a half. (I know, because Amazon just reminded me of my prior order as I checked out the product page to order another set.) Only now are they starting to show signs of aging. Before these, I had wipers from Rain-X (two different kinds) and while they cost about 75% as much, they lasted 30% of the time. You do the math.In case you're not familiar with them, Bosch is the company that actually makes the OEM wiper blades for many high end cars (like BMW, for one). In fact, you'd probably be surprised by how much inside your car is made by Bosch. So, you're not buying from a company that is just marketing cheap parts made in China and selling it with a lot of marketing. You're getting OEM quality with these, if not better. So, when considered in that light, as well, these blades really aren't that expensive.So, the blades really do last, but will you be happy with them while they do? I think so. They hold the shape of the windshield well, and never flap or vibrate, no matter how fast you're going. The bracket is solid, and worked well on the J-hook in my car. Many other \"universal\" mounts didn't work so well, notably the ones from the aforementioned Rain-X wipers. The single piece design is also great for those living in cold climates, as it is less vulnerable to ice and snow build-up.They don't streak or chatter, and even after having them on my car for over a year, they are only streaking a small amount.Given that your eyes are the most important safety device on your car, you owe it to yourself to not skimp on wiper blades. But I'm pleased to report that despite the upfront cost, these are actually MORE cost effective than many other premium wiper blades, given that they are the only expensive wiper blades I've ever used that actually lasted longer than the cheap ones.Tip: the A or the B after the model number (e.g. 22A) refers to the spring force of the blade (i.e. how hard it is to pull it straight). The B applies more force, and would be useful if you have a highly curved windshield. The fact that Bosch offers not just a variety of lengths down the inch, but also two different spring forces, is another indicator of the fact that these are not your average wiper blades. I found that having an A on the driver side and a B on the passenger side works best on my car. If in doubt, just try A all around, and then if you find that the blade is missing spots on the ends of the blade, return the A and get a B.Last tip: Amazon's database is helpful, but by no means complete. If you think this will fit your car, but Amazon says it won't, ignore Amazon. They say neither blade I have on my car will work, and yet I'm extremely happy with them, as you can tell.","reviewerID":"A198CCH4NNLI2E","unixReviewTime":1364256000}

I also paid more that way, and spent time going there. Ladies, if any are reading this, these snap right on. If I can do it anyone can. I have installed a different brand that took more time than these, but not all brands work equally well. Actually, these work better than the ones I get at the dealership, the ones that carry my car brand. Those become loose and don't grip the windshield fairly fast.Anco wiper blades never seem to lose their traction on the windshield. They last a long time. Here, any rubber part is quickly oxidized by the hot Florida sun, and in the case of wiper blades, causing streaks on the windshield. Some brands don't fit against the windshield snugly either, again,causing streaks. I change wiper blades about every six months, so getting these was good timing.Anco wiper blades not only go in quickly and easily, but the contour is springy and they hold against the glass tightly.

{"asin":"B002UCYRZU","overall":4,"reviewText":"After using the Novus polish to remove the scratches and haze from my car's headlights, I have found that the product does work, but it requires much more work than they lead you to believe. If you've seen the short on-line video's of this stuff in use, they make it look way too easy. It's not as easy as 1-2-3. First, my headlights weren't real bad, just some light scratching and slight oxidation. I used a variable speed drill and a 3 inch Roloc foam attachment to apply the polish. I did not use the #3 because my lights weren't that bad so I only used the #2. I applied the polish using the drill on a somewhat slow speed and found that I needed to apply a good amount of pressure to really get the scratches out. I added a little more speed on the drill and did a second application, again putting a good amount of pressure on it. As long as I kept the applicator moving back and forth, the plastic lens did not get warm at all so no worry about melting the plastic, but I think the foam applicator helped with that. A wool or felt applicator may have been different with the heat. After about a good 15 minutes or more of application of the #2 polish, I let a good coat of the polish dry on the lens as per the instructions. Then buffed with the drill a dry cloth applicator. Instructions say that this is a crutial step to get good results. The lights definately looked much better and were much clearer. This stuff does work, but expect to do some work, especially if you have a lot of scratching. Deep scratches likely will not be removed, but will look much less visible. The #3 polish may be needed for lenses that are severely scratched and oxidized, and expect to do some work. Forget about doing this by hand for headlights. I would suggest removing your headlights before doing this if you plan on using it for that. Overall a good product, but plan on using some elbow grease.","reviewerID":"A1AEEWWUVTJBP8","unixReviewTime":1369353600}

I'm 5'5\" so maybe this is a great feature for taller people who can get the leverage); the push pad is huge and gets in the way if you don't take it off; there isn't a brush to brush off the scraped ice\/frost and the pad won't do the job on that stuff.I think this product is great if you are in an area that gets a lot of wet, heavy snow that doesn't freeze to your windshield.

At the hardware store this kit ran me $80 so this price on Amazon is a great deal. I'm a gearhead and at first thought it was just a cheap little gimmick but after using it, I am sold. The kit comes with spare valve cores and a key. It pumped up my tire from completely flat to 30psi in about 5 mins, way faster than changing the whole tire. Ignore the bad reviews, they obviously did not read the 1 page manual that comes with it! Save yourself some trouble and read it while you're waiting for your tire to inflate. The kit is for emergencies only, not your everyday use air compressor. If this is what you're planning on using it for then I doubt it will last very long. It says to not let it run longer than 10 mins or something or it shuts off automatically because it is too hot. Unplug it and let it cool down (like any air compressor), then you can use it again. It also clearly states not to rely on the built in pressure gauge (again, like all air compressors) and it comes with a manual tire gauge to check the pressure before you take off.The one thing I am slightly disappointed with is the bottle of slime is for ATV\/Mower tires only, you shouldn't put it in your car tire. It worked for me cause I didn't need to use it and the only thing I use slime in is bike and mower tires anyway cause it is a pain to clean out of the tire and rim when you change a tire (I do mine myself so that's why I care).

{"asin":"B004NFTOLY","overall":4,"reviewText":"I bought this after being frustrated with my old system of \"rotate antenna, do a channel scan, rotate again, do another scan, etc\".After installing, we went to a campsite we were at a few months previously where we only picked up one channel using the manual method.  Using the new Winegard Sensar Pro, we were able to home in more precisly in the direction of the antennas for different stations and picked up 3 more channels, including a nice digital PBS station, that we didn't find previously.My only gripe is that it's not easy to install this somewhere where you can see it or work the controls near where the antenna crank\/rotator is.  I thought about this ahead of time and installed it in a spot where I can (barely) see the display while rotating the antenna, but it's awkward.  Not all RV's will be as flexible in the location, I'm sure.  But you can turn up the volume on it so if you're unable to read the numbers while rotating, you can at least go by the beeps.  You'd be moving around a lot more to work the different functions of the unit (go from scan to channel for instance), but it can be done.  In my case, I was able to mount it inside a cabinet in the bedroom where the antenna crank is located, just on the other side of the wall where the TV itself sits.  The TV in our trailer rotates to be viewed from the living area or the bedroom, so once I'm tuned in, I can even rotate the antenna and see the results on the TV itself, which has a signal meter too.  But the Winegard meter is more convienent now.Setting the gain is helpful... where we camp in the boonies, it usually means setting the gain all the way up to 20, but I can see how if you're near a broadcast tower, you might need to lower that to avoid overload distortion.  The gain might be less useful on digital broadcasts than analog... yes, there are still stations broadcasting in analog (near Astoria, Oregon in our case).Installation was no problem, but then I'm handy.  Since I wasn't just replacing the stock Winegard amp that came with our antenna, it meant making an entirely new cutout in a very awkward to work in place, but even if I replaced the stock amp, I would have had to enlarge that cutout to make this one fit.  So be prepared for some work there, or just let a pro installer do it if you're uncomfortable making holes in your RV.","reviewerID":"A1BVX09366ZBN2","unixReviewTime":1321228800}

If the negative battery post is connected to the vehicle chassisthen the vehicle has a negative ground system.(Most systems are negative)3.

{"asin":"B000BPSW7C","overall":4,"reviewText":"OK, must say, love my cars and want them to look great. In the last decades, I've used a huge array of the waxes out there, in the never ending quest for the perfect shine: Meguire's, (many versions) Turtle Wax, Zymol, Liquid Glass, Future 2000, Black Magic, Rain Dance, 3M, Turtle Wax Ice (paste and liquid), Turtle Wax Black Box, Mother's, Color Magic, etc. Liquid, paste, carnauba, synthetic, carnauba\/sytntetic, cleaner wax, cleaner polish wax, polish wax, clay bar system, liquid clay bar. And those are just the ones off the top of my head!With that said, here are the conclusions:- I've never noticed a real difference between most any of them with respect to how the car looks after I've applied them. Put them on and the car looks great. This applies to the true waxes - the quickie things like Turtle Wax Liquid Ice, which isn't a wax at all IMHO, being the exceptions.- For most all of them, if you look at on line reviews, one will say it's the best and greatest, the next will hate it. So, VERY subjective.- Seems the more it costs and\/or the more aplication effort involved, the higher it rates and the more staunch the opinions. Think there is a HUGE self fulfilling prophecy going on here;) Liquid Glass was expensive and a huge pain to apply (it looked just like any other I've used), yet it is rated 5 stars by most.- Carnauba provides the strongest protection against physical damage by stones and road debris. BUT is harder to apply and least durable over time.- Synthetic provides the most durable protection against the elements. AND is easy to apply.- God help me for saying this, but I can't tell a huge difference between a carnauba and synthetic wax job - both shine beautifully.That said, the goals of waxes\/waxing is: Great shine, durable protection, less work, less needed yearly applications and reasonable pricing.So, here is the secret formula for those goals:1) Wax twice a year.2) Apply a carnauba\/cleaner wax coat3) Apply Turtle Wax Ice PASTE coat - this is a good synthetic, but it's real advantage is that it is CLEAR. Not only does it not leave ANY white residue, but it can and should be used on all surfaces of the exterior - paint and PLASTICS. So, it is fast to apply\/remove and it makes plastics look brand new.To the review of Nu Finish, it is a fine synthetic with the advantages of being highly rated for durability by \"a leading consumer magazine\" (as was Turtle Wax Ice Paste)and being easy to apply and remove - can do a whole car in like 45 minutes. BUT, it leaves the hated white residue, especially on plastics.  We're it not for that, I would have given it 5 stars - like I would most any reputable wax product out there.....","reviewerID":"A1CIBI697YK58A","unixReviewTime":1367107200}

But still, it works poorly for me.The selector valve that you use to switch between evacuating\/dispensing is ridiculously difficult to operate.  I can't just push or lift my selector valve to operate it.  No, I have to twist it while pushing\/pulling like a madman, and hope I don't break anything (including my fingers).  I was able to loosen it up somewhat by spraying the valve with silicone\/Teflon spray, and operating it repeatedly.  But (1) It's still not easy to operate, and (2) I shouldn't have to do that.The expandable plug that must be expanded to evacuate\/dispense or removed to pour fluid out is ridiculously difficult to remove.  It's just a poor-fitting device.The tube connector where the main evacuation tube enters the top of the unit leaked when I put it in dispense mode.  I had to pay over $27 to get a replacement \"Tube Connector Kit\" (822566), since my unit is out of warranty.After replacing the tube connector and trying dispense mode again, I found that the top plate leaks.  I had not noticed this before, but it explains why it always took so much pumping when I evacuated oil!  When I use it in dispense mode now, the main tube doesn't leak anymore, but air and oil come out from under the top plate.  I removed the top plate, and sure enough, \"Look Ma, no seal!\"  It would be bad enough if the seal had merely failed, but for the seal not to be included in the first place is inexcusable.  Because I didn't notice this problem sooner, the seal (822821) is costing me an additional $13, including a ridiculous $8.75 fee for shipping.Now I've added (not replaced--added) the top seal, and while doing a test, I can hear that the unit leaks air at the top of the pump assembly.  I give up on this thing.This would be a great practical joke if it didn't cost me so much money.","reviewerID":"A1D9V4TAFTO6M2","unixReviewTime":1293926400}

You can't unthread the cynch straps, but you can unhook them from the bottom attachment and re-run them.The \"clear\" panel on top is not clear at all.  Translucent maybe.  No chance you can see what is inside.The \"non-skid\" base is really not very effective at all - especially because the smooth fabric from the sides wraps around the bottom edges.I really don't understand the purpose of this.

It doesn't have the high shine of top grain leather so this product definitely worked differently.I tried this on an ottoman that had a few stains (pen, a glass mark) and lots of general use wear. I did test it in a discreet area first and knew going into it that it would leave it slightly darker. With that in mind, I used it on the entire top of the ottoman. It sank in really quickly and was much darker. I really had nothing to wipe off since the leather soaked it all up. But my rag had some discoloration with may have come from the leather dye - although it was very minimal. The end result is that the ottoman has dried to a slightly darker version and evened out some of the stains but has not removed them. I would have been amazed if they did come out since they had really penetrated. Overall, the leather looks in better condition, like it's been given a good drink after being thirsty.

{"asin":"B005JU5W54","overall":5,"reviewText":"I installed this wiper blade on my 2006 Lexus, which my husband is driving in the Seattle area while he is temporarily assigned there. Living in Texas, we don't get much precipitation of any kind so the kind of wipers you use aren't as critical as in areas that see more weather. The ICON line is Bosch's extreme weather blades. I purchased the Bosch Evolution blades for my 2004 Texas driven PT Cruiser, and upon comparing the two, the ICON blades are thicker and feature a different slope which would clearly handle snow and sleet easily.There are no instructions for removing your old blades on the Icon packaging and I had to Google some videos to figure out how to do it. Installing the new blades was easy and there are clear illustrations on the back of the package.Be sure to  plug your car's year, make and model number in the Amazon \"Find Parts That Fit my Vehicle\" tool to assure you buy the correct blades. My cars all require different sizes on the driver and passenger sides and windshields have different slopes so this is important.These Bosch blades are frameless, meaning that there is no metal frame holding the rubber wiper. The entire blade is thick rubber. I like this better because there are no metal tips that could potentially scratch your windshield should the rubber fail and the rubber is thicker so it makes better contact with your windshield.Of course, it's how well they work that matters and these perform beautifully. My husband drove through a recent snowstorm and some sleet and said these blades made a huge difference and helped him maintain excellent visibility. Get caught in a downpour or a snowstorm and you will be glad you have good wipers!Recommended.","reviewerID":"A1FDSZISWIXH1A","unixReviewTime":1329264000}

I don't really have a pre-2011 Wrangler to check the fit in, but the cutouts for the transmission bump don't seem designed for the 2011+, preventing the mats from laying flat.

I often get frustrated because my F150 dries before I can get it sufficiently wiped down, leaving spots on my truck. The 'Dry Blade' comes in handy, especially on those large areas (hood, sides). That way you aren't trying to remove every drop of water by absorbing it with a towel. The blade is slick and, if you did a good job cleaning, should not cause any scratches. It also works well for window glass, which are often smeared by towels.The Pocketed Drying Towel is simply a large microfiber towel. For whatever reason, microfiber feels weird to me... like it wants to stick to me. But it still does a good job. Overall, microfiber is pretty absorbent and this towel is no exception. While some may complain about it being too large, it's large enough that you don't need 5 towels to get your car or truck dry. The 'pockets' are simply a nice convenience. You put one hand in each, then dry using a 'wipe on, wipe off' motion (see: &#34;Karate Kid&#34;). It is lint-free, as the product promises. Once wrung out, the microfiber dries quickly. I recommend you wash it after each use, of course.Overall, these are a great addition to your car-care arsenal, and should last quite a while.","reviewerID":"A1G8USRY17IR1X","unixReviewTime":1397692800}

But, when I get ready to hop on the bike and see that green light shining at me, I know my ride will be trouble-free (as far as the battery goes).Personally, I used the 'permanent' hook-ups provided that basically bolts to your battery connections. The extension that stays on your bike tucks away nicely and plugs back in quickly.

I would have to knock on it from time to time but 3 years later, it was still working, but I bought this bulb anyway just in case.  4 months ago, knocking didn't work and I replaced the original Toyota bulb.  It was easy to replace, just twist off, twist back in and don't touch the glass of the bulb, just the rubberized plastic mount.  No tools needed! Compared to the original one still working, it is as bright, and I can see no difference.  I tried replacing the other original bulb so they'd be replaced in pairs and be in sync, but I found that when the bulb works, the bulb assembly gets very hot, and its impossible to twist the bulb off until it cools down.  So, since its easier to remove once the bulb blows or I let the car park overnight, I just carry another bulb in my glove compartment to prepare for the day it eventually really does blow.","reviewerID":"A1HDQMD058B644","unixReviewTime":1385942400}

I'm familiar with the 3M clear bra system from professionals and it is very, very good but expensive.  So here comes what I think is the same product in a DIY format.First, you need to really prepare the surface for this product.  Not just wash the car but wash, clay, machine clean, polish (but NOT wax) and make sure it is absolutely baby butt smooth and that there is no dirt or debris residing on the surface.  However, even after doing all this, I still had dust on the surface by time I masked off the rest of the front end.  So my first attempt was way less then perfect so I thought I'll just peel it off and try again - wrong!  The easy peel nature of this product is a fiction - it's a mess to remove and will try your patience.I threw the rest of the product away and figured if I really wanted the protection, I'd go to the professionals and pay $300 for a 3M clear bra treatment which I understand is very, very good and very durable.

{"asin":"B00063X7KG","overall":5,"reviewText":"When I first read about claying your vehicles, several years ago, I was a bit skeptical.  It seems strange and like a lot of work for you car, but both impressions were incorrect.After washing your vehicle with a safe wash, Claying your vehicle is the next step and a vital step.  Claying removes above surface contaminants on your paint's surface: bits of overspray, tar, etc. and lots of other things you can or more likely can't even see.  After washing your car, rub your flat hand across the surface. It won't smooth as glass. Furthermore, listen!  You'll hear your hand going back and forth over the surface as it rubs against the contaminants.  This is a car that needs to be clayed and just about any car if it has never been clayed needs to be clayed.  Even a brand new car on the lot often has contaminants.  Furthermore, once clayed, it's usually recommend to do it again every 3 months to a year, depending on the environment your car is in.  Honestly, claying your vehicle doesn't take a particularly long amount of time.  I'd say it's possible to do it in just under thirty minutes.The Smooth Surface Clay Kit from the wonderful folks at Meguiar's is the perfect kit to clay your vehicle.  Again, after washing your vehicle, spray an area with the Quick Detailer, and then use the clay bar across the surface.  You can search Youtube for Meguiar's Clay kit, to see demonstrations from users, but it isn't hard to do. Do a thorough job on your vehicle, and the way your hand then moves across the surface will impress you.  I'm amazed every time.After claying, you have several options.  The clay kit includes a sample of cleaner wax, and you can certainly use that. It has some mild cleaners and some protection.  However, if you use a cleaner wax, I'd recommend waxing the car more often as it isn't quite as durable as dedicated separate products.  Once a month for example with the cleaner wax, would be good.  Or, you could use the cleaner wax for its mild below surface cleaning properties followed by a more robust wax product such as Meguiar's Gold Class or NXT 2.0, and then you could potentially be set for a few months.If you want to do even more after claying, you can use a paint cleaner from Meguiar's for below surface contaminants right after claying, and then optionally a Pure Polish after that.  You'd top all that off with a wax such as Meguiar's Gold Class, or Meguiar's NXT 2.0.Furthermore, pick up more of the Quick Detailer, and you can use it to remove light dust and contaminants to your paint on a regular basis, and you can actually find you won't have to wash your vehicle as often.Whatever you choose, regular maintenance of your car's finish will keep you smiling for years to come. Meguiar's clay kit is a great way to start because not only does it make your finish smooth as glass, but it allows whatever wax you apply to adhere more evenly and properly to the surface, providing a better shine and longer lasting protection.A great product. Highly recommended.","reviewerID":"A1JUBRIZMO0RJV","unixReviewTime":1221436800}

The bottom panel closest to the peddle simply pops out and there is a bar there to mount a terminal stirp with can be picked up over amazon or radioshack.

{"asin":"B00AX4TWCA","overall":4,"reviewText":"I've used the 'other' windshield sealing product for decades. I bought it when it was an infomercial special. Once I got it applied right I was amazed at how it improved driving in almost every wet weather situation. Light mist being the one thing these products don't handle well. So I was happy to try the Griot's Garage version when it was offered.Application was easy. One small towel wet with the product applied in a crosshatch pattern on the windows. Wait a few minutes for that coat to dry and apply a second coat. Then buff off with another, clean, towel. Just about the same as the 'other' product except I used to use a wet method of buffing off theirs and Griot's only mentions using a dry towel to remove the haze that forms when you apply this.I must say that the Griot's Garage window sealant buffed off much easier than Rain-X (there, I said it) ever did. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. Does it buff off so easily because it's leaving less product applied to the window or is it just formulated better? Or was the wet method I used to use just that bad at getting the job done? I really can't say at this point.Fortunately just a day or two after applying this the Florida weather kicked up several hours of serious downpours while I was out. I was even test driving a new Kia in the middle of the storms and really wished I had been back in my car when the rain got heavy.This stuff works. Just as well as Rain-X (I said it again) ever did. Rain water beads up and at speeds over 30mph or so just shoot right the heck off the windshield. At slower speeds they quickly slide down the glass. I usually get one rainy season out of a coating on my car. I'm driving a bit more than I have in the past years so I'm sure this will be put to the test frequently. When it starts to wear off and needs another application I'll come back and update this review.Things I wanted to note:The bottle works differently; lift the cap so the dimple that seals it is lowered inside the cap. I found that no matter what I did product leaked out from around the bottom lip of the cap you lift up to dispense the sealer. I probably wasted a  more product than I used due to this leakage.This product, compared to Rain-X is expensive (yes, I received this for free but I made myself aware of the price to provide a comprehensive review) in fact it's several times more expensive than the old style flip-top Rain-X product that is still available. Griot's clear bottle lets you see easier when you're running low but I can't detect any real difference between the two products, they smell and apply exactly the same. Griot's only benefit was buffing off easier.I'll report back with a longevity update. Perhaps Griot's Garage Glass Sealant will last significantly longer.","reviewerID":"A1MCH5RXDOH87H","unixReviewTime":1397692800}

I'm very happy to recommend these to anybody. By the way they come two to the pack.UPDATE FEB 2014:I purchased another set. Now I have 4 on each end of my awning.

It shook and flapped but no problems overall. Then came the ice, still no problems. I would go out twice a day and with a push broom hit the awning from underneath to break up the ice.

{"asin":"B002L146OC","overall":4,"reviewText":"This is a solid little compressor and is perfect for throwing in your trunk. I bought this after returning a cheap plastic &#34;accu-gauge&#34; compressor that didn't work. I've only used this thing twice so far, but I'm very satisfied with it.The Good:- Solid metal construction. I think it's made of steel, but it's extremely solidly built.- Brass screw-on connector to attach to your valve stem. I really can't believe some people don't like this. Three twists and the brass connector is locked solid onto your valve stem and doesn't come off. Yes, it loses a tiny bit of pressure when you unscrew it, but it's a negligible amount. This connector is so much easier and reliable than the kind where you flip the little handle up.- Relatively quiet for an air compressor. It sounds like a lawnmower in your neighbor's backyard, which is much quieter than most.- It doesn't get too hot. I inflated large SUV tires from 25 to 35 PSI and the heatsink was warm, but not hot.- Comes with a nice little carrying case.The Bad:- The gauge is off by at least 5 PSI. When this pump read 40 PSI, my more accurate digital gauge read 35. This means that you really need a separate pressure gauge to use this thing.- My pump has a warning printed directly on the glass face of the gauge (and it's not removable) stating the margin of error of the gauge. This is a terrible place to put it and makes the gauge difficult to read.- In order to fit the pump into the carrying case, you have to detach the rubber air hose.- The cord is just a little short - an extra foot or two would make a huge difference.","reviewerID":"A1MV2GGCYD2AFQ","unixReviewTime":1387324800}

I couldn't be more disgusted than having to drag a battery into Walmart or to some dumb kid in an autoparts store to try and receive my prorated warranty.  I am now fully confident in my ability to be sure if the problem is the battery or the charging system, but in my past, my absolute worst fear was that I went through the above process for nothing, that there was nothing wrong with the battery after all.And so for the average homeowner that maintains his own car, I think this is an excellent, simple and effective device.  Of course there are more sophisticated battery testing systems out there that put a heavy load on your battery and analyze each individual cell (this is what they're doing when they test your battery before giving you that prorated warranty), but this will tell you with high certainty what is wrong with your battery or charging system in under five minutes.  To me, a great device to have around.One thing that bothers me:  the name.  As this product is manufactured by a company called Clore Automotive, how did this thing get the name \"Solar\"?  I could be too cynical, but I swear they are trying to get the ignorant consumer to believe that this is some fancy solar powered device.  In fact, it gets its energy from the battery it is testing.  That part seems really cheesy and stupid, and if I was 100% sure of my suspicions, I'd probably drop my rating further.

It's not much more expensive than copper plugs so it was definitely worth a try.This model was a direct replacement for my aging 1996 Infiniti I30 V6. No problems with install but make sure to buy the anti-seize lubricant.UPDATE: Took my car to the shop for other work and after pulling these plugs, they said this model 4501 was the wrong one for my 1996 infiniti i30.

Even though my hubby is very handy, he was concerned he wouldn't be able to replace the windshield wiper blade on his own. I assured him there was a video posted, so I figured it would be 'a piece of cake.' Well, it wasn't quite as easy as the video depicts...at least for my hubby because Tess's wiper 'arm type' wasn't at all like ours. He went out to the car armed with the instructions; ready to get the blade changed in 5 minutes. It took him approx. 25 minutes because neither of us could figure out which adapter\/connector we needed to use. He brought the instructions back in the house for me to look at. My goodness, the print was so small, I had to put on my extra strong reading glasses to magnify it.Neither of us thought the instructions were very clear; we weren't sure what to do next. Then I looked at the back of the box which has nice large pictures of the four adapter\/connector pieces (G, B, D, & H) and large pictures of the 'Arm Types.' So, I thought, \"I know he\/we can do this.\" I began searching online...maybe, I'd find more information about our Honda's arm type, but there hasn't been much posted yet. Twenty minutes later, my husband pulled out the car's manual. Don't you know, there's information right in the manual that tells how to remove the wiper blade. (He squeezed the sides together to push off the tab; the tab wouldn't push off so he used a screwdriver to pry it off). He came inside holding the old wiper blade to show me...*victory! I finally removed the old one.* Still not sure which adapter\/connector to use, my hubby goes back outside; less than five minutes later he comes in and says...I didn't need to change the adapter, the G adapter (which is on the blade when you receive it) worked fine!I was driving through a foggy area late last night & used the wipers to clear off the windshield. (I'd totally forgotten about the new blade) When I got home, I mentioned how foggy some areas were & that I had to use the wipers. Hubby asked, \"Did they work? I wondered because I didn't test them.\" Oh my gosh! I was out in the country, no street lights, very foggy evening, & no white lines on the sides of the road...thankfully the new wiper worked perfectly. I will post more updates when we use the wiper during inclement weather.4 stars - I think the instructions could be a bit clearer.  Be sure to check the back of the box for much larger pictures. Also, having your car's manual available might help with removing the old blade; it helped us.AutoTex PINK donates a portion of every windshield wiper sale to the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

{"asin":"B000GU3KHE","overall":3,"reviewText":"I have used this same model cover on my bike for nearly a decade, and this is my fourth cover purchase.  They are fantastic quality and fit for the price!Storage indoors, and the cover will easily last 5+ years if you're careful not to snag it, as it will tear easily on sharp corners (mirrors, license-plates, etc.).  For the first 5-6 years of my bike's life, it was stored indoors, and one cover lasted easily during that period... where I live now, I don't have that luxury (yet).Outdoors, this cover will keep your bike dry and protect it from harmful UV damage for at least two seasons (mine started to fall apart after 3-years of year-round, outdoor coverage, but I also coat it annually with Camp-Dry to increase water repellent ability and UV protection).  The elastic does start to give out after a couple of years, but still holds the cover securely on the bike in high winds.Sizing:For sizing, The XL fits perfectly (slightly snug around the license plate and rear turn-signals) over my 1100cc Honda Sabre with 19\" windshield, large saddle-bags, and small tour-pack behind sissy-bar.  This XL fits exactly the same as the XL made 10 years ago, with the only exception being the snugness around the license plate and rear turn signals... I'd be happier with an extra inch or two of material back there.If I had to buy again, it would be a toss-up as to the XL or XXL.  My last one was an XXL and it was very loose-fitting, which caused it to flap in the wind, catch wind under it, and sagged in heavy rain, which created places where water would \"pocket\" on top or droop to the seat-level, eventually soaking through the material.  The XXL also covered (almost) all the way to the ground, which meant more chances of getting it dirty at the bottom or having hot pipes\/engine touching the black material (not the heat-resistant silver).Design Change:The newest version of this cover also does not have silver running 360-degrees around the cover, as in the picture.  The black material of the top now covers down to the front wheel, and the silver starts right behind the forks.  This does help you to find the front of the cover in poor lighting, and actually looks much better when on the bike.Cons:My only real issue is that the material of the newest version of this cover is slightly thinner and more \"nylon-feel\" than \"cloth-feel\" of the ones made 10 years ago (or even five years ago), and the cover does not have the full Nelson-Rigg logo... missing \"More than just a Bike\" wording below the logo... no biggie, but having the full logo does make it easier to find the \"front\" of the cover in the dark :)  I do not believe the thinner feeling material affects the cover in the least, as mine has successfully kept my bike clean and dry during heavy snowfalls and torrential downpours over the past three months, and still looks like NEW.  We'll have to see about longevity... but if it lasts 2-3 years in outdoor conditions, I'll not be complaining!Update 6-8-14:When putting the cover on my bike today in anticipation of rain, the cover ripped as tension was placed over the windshield and mirrors.  The rip was not bad, but very disappointing to spend $40 on a cover that has barely held up to 6-months of use and very mild weather!  I will be contacting Nelson Rigg to obtain a replacement under warranty!","reviewerID":"A1PZBHF3YHQXEI","unixReviewTime":1389312000}

{"asin":"B000X9EGFS","overall":5,"reviewText":"This compressor delivers fast air at continuous operation 100% duty cycle unit is capable of pressures up to 150 PSI continuously without the need to be rested, unlike lower priced compressors that can leave you stranded. I have gone through several other compressors that take long time periods to get your tires up to pressure, if the ever get there without melting down. I have a F350 that we pull a 5th wheel with Class D tires inflate to 80 Lbs. PSI. Many of those compressors fail before achieving that pressure. This is quality equipment right down to the accessories. The connectors, gauges, and inflation gun are my favorites because of quality, ease of use, and accuracy. It's great for my 5th wheel and with the hose I can reach all my tires on the tow vehicle as well as the 5th wheel without  pause.  I often go to my jeep or truck to use these tools instead of the many I have in my shop. Two minor issues Is the rubber shocks on the sand plate I feel should be metal springs because I picture them rotting but they do work very well . Then the oddly shaped  bag is nice, but it's a bag leaving the unit somewhat vulnerable to damage,  from things being placed on top of it in loading, and difficult to pack because of its shape. I know this can happen because my first unit came freight damaged with the quick connector cracked off. A hard case would be more bulky but may be a better alternative and easier to find a place to pack. I have come up with my own fixes to both of those issues. These is a wise investment, and recommend it to 4X4 enthusiasts, and RV'ers.  I hope to share with you my most recent experience (below) how it save me the agony of criticism from my wife and gained approval of my buying my toys. I hope the review was helpful and enjoyable.Here's the scenario. We were out camping in Mammoth lakes, CA with our 5th wheel. One day while we were on a side trip leaving the 5th wheel at camp we visited some of the local natural sites. This day in particular was Obsidian Dome (a huge dome of Volcanic glass). After driving around it we started to explore the adjacent roads. We went to several beautiful areas on good roads with no incident. The final excursion (somehow it's always the last one) we venture down a road leading across the edge of a meadow into some trees.  The road started to get rougher and narrower and felt it prudent to reverse direction in a campward conclusion. The road was to narrow to turn so I back down several hundred feet to a spot I could make a multiple \"Y\" turn in my 4x4 `02' F350 super cab that has a lousy turn radius. It really becomes more of a \"W+\" maneuver.  I find a nice clear space and backed up into it successfully and went forward into the opposing bank in effort to re back to change my angle back down the road. Now remember where I am (volcanic region with pumice for soil) and what I am driving ( a monster rv hauling truck with highway tire pressure of 80 lbs PSI). That's the turnaround point comes as well as the wedded bliss starts to crumble, because my front tires sink into 12\" of pumice fluff. But no problem I have a Hilift jack and the 4x4 kit (bought at Amazon .COM LLC), but I'm short on chain. So I add a old tow strap into the mix and start to pull out of the holes my tires were spinning in. My wife saw the light at the end of the tunnel and the sun about ready to go behind the mountain. She actually said she would never complain about \"My toys I buy\".  That lasted for about 5 minutes when the old strap stitching at the hook gave away and the truck rolled back into it's original position. From experience I swiftly said That's OK I can still fix this. I said We need to rethink this. She started mumbling something like she would go to the Bahamas next year. I couldn't help thinking my tire pressure was an issue here so I break out the Viair compressor (bought at Amazon .COM LLC),. She said whats that?, another toy?  I installed the tire valve stem deflators (bought at Amazon .COM LLC),  and took the pressure to 15 lbs.  This is a piece of advice: get her busy picking up bark and stuff to add body to the pumice or sand.  Eureka!  SCORE! The trick did the job and I kept my smartest man in the world status with my lovely red head (the dogs never lost the faith). We got turned around without calling AAA before dark and proceeded down the road to a junction with very good base. Now this is where the compressor comes in. Now I need to reflate the tires to Highway pressure. My experience with other compressors was they will take an immense time to refill and melt down after lengthily operation.  This compressor promises contrary to that and delivers. In fact It seemed to fill just as fast as my 3 hp compressor in my shop. On the same road trip my air lift bag compressor melted down and I was able to manually use this one to fill my bags. Turns out my wife approved the purchases and we will be returning to Mammoth next year. &#61514;","reviewerID":"A1QVOYKF2RP9PA","unixReviewTime":1349136000}

{"asin":"B002U6IL9O","overall":5,"reviewText":"The pads are definitely large enough to heat you quickly.  The low setting is very warm, and the high setting is too hot.  They get to max temp about as quickly as factory heated seats.As the product states, it is for professional installation only, but it's really not that difficult.  Do a Google search for the product, and you'll find an installation guide.  The electrical part is the easiest.  They give you a fuse tab, so there's really not much electrical work required.Installation (done on a 2006 Mazda 3):Disconnect the bolts (probably 4) holding the seat to the car.Disconnect the battery ground!!!  Your battery will probably die from being unplugged so long, so be prepared to jump the vehicle.  Don't connect the battery ground until everything (mainly the airbag wires) are reconnected.Unplug any connectors(power seats, airbags...) from the seat.Remove the seat, and take it indoors.Start removing clips\/clasps\/velcro holding the seat fabric on (this is the most time consuming part).  It's very similar to doing upholstery on a couch.  The seats have metal clips, similar to staples.  This is what the included tool is for.  The tool did break within 10 seconds of me using it, but a normal pair of needle nose pliers works just as well.Only remove the clips that are necessary for placing the pads.  You don't really need to replace them if the fabric holds tightly by itself.Make sure you figure out where you want the pads before you uncover the sticky tape.Place the pads so that the wires are going toward the bottom rear of the seat.  Place sticky side onto the foam.  You may have to rip out a little hole in the foam for heating pad connectors to rest in.  This will prevent lumps in the seat.Ensure that the pad wires are in a good spot and won't get in the way of people sitting behind the seat.  You want them exiting the bottom rear of the seat.  You can always make an extra hole for the wires.Pull tight and make sure it looks and feels good before reattaching the fabric.  You don't want lumps or wrinkles.Re-install the seat.  Make sure wires will fit (along with your button location) to the fuse box.  Plug back in anything that was disconnected from the seats (airbags and other wires).Decide where to put the button.  I chose near my right knee.  This will allow you to drill the hole without removing any dash components.  Pick a location where you can drill without hurting anything, and still be able to run the wires from the hole.Run the wires from the rear of the seat to the foot well.  Depending on the vehicle, this can probably be done by shoving the wires between the carpet and the plastic trim.  I didn't have to remove any trim.Connect all the connectors so your're ready to install the fuse tab.Using your vehicle manual, choose a fuse.  You're car might have a &#34;heated seats&#34; fuse already allocated.  Make sure the fuse will turn off when the engine is off, and has the correct (or greater) amps.  I chose a ground location on one of the bolts in the pedal assembly in the driver's foot well.Your battery is probably dead by this point, so make sure everything is plugged in and in place, and reconnect the battery ground and try to start.  Jump the battery if needed.Make sure the switch works, and turns off when the engine is off.Put everything back together, hide wires with zip ties, and make it look good.","reviewerID":"A1QXAHCOAVS3GN","unixReviewTime":1385510400}

Best for protection (it's about 100 times harder than wax) ease of applying, ease of removing etc. Used it for 24 years now on my 90 Camry. Before that on my 83 Mazda. It last WAY LONGER than all the high priced garbage that is out there. Only caveat. Unlike Nu-Finish liquid  (which I also like) you must only do ONE PART of your car at a time with the paste. Just rub it on in a circular motion on about a 2 square feet area, wait about ONE minute, then rub it off. If you leave it longer, you will get an uneven look. Once you learn to do it this way, it will look perfect EVERY tie. I do all my cars twice per year with this stuff. I go to car washes all year. Then, come spring and summer, it's time for two more coats of Nu-Finish. My 90 Camry STILL looks great. (I did clay bar it this year to really smooth out the finish and THEN used Nu-Finish). Bottom line, it is NOT wax Cars today use plastic clear coat. Was was for lacquer finishes of yesteryear. Clear Coats fair MUCH better with a Polymer NON-wax polish like Nu-Finish. This lasts LONG and it's cheap. Don't fall for the hype of all those crazy expensive polishes. It's ALL hype. ESPECIALLY carnauba wax on a clear coat paint. Wax wears off FAST.

{"asin":"B002ZBPX1S","overall":4,"reviewText":"It has taken me some time to write a review for the Lexol 3-in-1 Leather Care Spray, because I wanted to be sure and put it through its paces and give the product a good real-life evaluation before doing so. For years, I have used a competitive product with which I was always generally satisfied. I compared the Lexol side-by-side with the other product I've used previously, not so much to pit one against the other (though that is inevitible), but to compare Lexol to what was my baseline expectation for a leather cleaner\/conditioner.The first thing that one might notice with Lexol is the odor of the product. I would be less than forthcoming if I didn't say it is borderline offensive. Though the smell did put me off, I persisted using the product both on automotive leather and household leather. My observations are listed below, but my overall opinion after some good evaluation is very favorable. I may just switch and buy Lexol from now on.CLEANING -  The first important thing we need this product to do is to CLEAN the leather, right? While I will often pre-clean badly soiled leather with a mild soap and water and dry before using a leather care product, I tested the Lexol without any pre-clean to see what it has to offer. I was pleasantly surprised at the general effectiveness of cleaning ground-in dirty leather. I found that for heavily soiled areas, if you spray the Lexol on and let it soak in for a minute or so, then agitate gently with a microfiber cloth, it does a very good job of lifting the dirt out of the grain. I have ivory colored leather furniture that I allow my German Shepherd to lie on, and believe me - it gets dirty! It cleans as well as any spray-on product I have used.ODOR -  As mentioned above, this really bothered me at first. It does not have what I consider a pleasant smell. Okay... I think it stinks (there, I said it). This is subjective, and others may mind it more or less than I do - but I would prefer a nicer smell.CONDITIONING -  The conditioning properties seem to be good. Lexol leaves the leather soft and suple and it retains that quality for quite some time. One thing I like a lot about Lexol compared to some other brands, is that it leaves the leather with \"grippy\" natural feel - not slippery like many others do. Particularly when it comes to the leather seats in my cars, I don't want to slide around on them. I want them to grip me like leather is supposed to - and Lexol provides this feel very well. During evaluation, I used the Lexol on one leather sofa cushion and another spray-on leather cleaner\/conditioner on the adjacent cushion. The results of the way the surface is left was remarkable. The \"other product side\" was quite slippery, while the Lexol side was nice and \"grippy\" (but not tacky).","reviewerID":"A1RPJHUVVSI98A","unixReviewTime":1327881600}

I typically only buy a new car every 8-10 years, and keep the old car as a spare. A panel like this is a lot more convenient than periodically starting the engine, or running a cord from the house or garage to a charger tucked in under the hood.  The instructions say that the panel should be capable of doing a full charge on batteries up to 20 amp-hours in capacity, and to test that I've currently got mine on the battery of my scooter, which has been sitting in the garage all winter without a charger. I'm thinking this might also be useful for charging batteries on mobile electronics, like cell phones and iPods.Overall construction looks reasonably solid, and four wood screws are included in the package, suggesting the user might screw it to an outside wall or the roof of a shed.

Hand sanding typically does not distribute sand dust all over the place anyway but tends to fall down straight for the most part.  This is easily dealt with by keeping a vacuum next to where one is sanding and just sucking it up once in a while.The hose makes my sanding style cumbersome and awkward,  not to mention that getting it hooked up to my shop vac is quite a hassle,  and so is changing the sand paper because the contraption has to be reattached to the shop vac every time the sand paper is changed.Dragging the hose around is a real drag.The quality seems rather flimsy as well.I also would rather hand sand in peace and quiet without hearing a loud shop vac going the whole time.The bottom line:  If this attachment were made for an electric sander that blows stuff all over the place then maybe it would be tolerable.For hand sanding I will stick to the old fashioned way!

The 3M Paint Defender System goes on hazy but dries COMPLETELY CLEAR to provide a tough and invisible barrier against rocks and debris for the parts of your vehicle vulnerable to chips and scratches.The kit comes with everything you need: microfiber cloth, wax, spray canister of protectant, spray trigger, and plastic car cover. It's important to follow the instructions to the tee!CAUTION: make sure to spray on at least 3 even coats of the protectant. This ensures that the protectant dries and cures into a tough and tear-resistant film that peels off clean when it comes time to remove it. If you haven't applied enough coats, the resulting film may be so thin and prone to tearing that when you try to remove it later on, you will end up picking at and peeling off tiny scraps at a time -- a nightmare!

These covers are loose-woven cotton canvas with a wire tension backer for quick-on\/off.  They are NOT vinyl or vinyl-backed. When it rains, it is going to get the tire wet. They are good for a little wind-blocking, and UV blocking...but aren't going to help you a bit when it comes to rain or dust.I got them because out here in the desert, if you don't UV block your RV tires, you will be buying tires every single year, even if you don't put a mile on them...the sun is brutal to tires! These are like sunblock for your tires...I've used them before (then again, I've used old T-shirts, too), and they work excellent...but if you are in Louisiana, or Tennessee, or South Carolina, or anywhere else you are going to get 50-70-inches of rain each year with lots of year-round humidity...they will rot in no-time, and doubtful do anything to help preserve your tires...in that case, you need VINYL COVERS. (Here...we are lucky if we get 10-inches of rain a year...during a two-week time period...rot is NOT a problem).Bottom line:  Be aware that tires dry rot because of two things - OZONE and UV in combination.  You can't keep Ozone or Oxygen off your tires...so you break the 'dry rot cycle' by blocking the sun.  If you are in a dry hot climate and need sun protection...BUY THEM.

If your rig is prewired - all you need is the adapter plug for your make and model of vehicle and you simply plug it in, mount it in place and your done.  My particular vehicle was not prewired but installing and running the wiring, plugs and a circuit breaker (local auto parts store) and testing just took a couple of hours.After installation, you start your rig and trailer rolling and set the breaking level with the little thumb wheel (the display shows the output voltage to the trailer brakes) to just before the brakes on your trailer lock up and then back off slightly.  Your then set and ready to go!We liked best-1.That you can install it any position2. It performs a continuous self check and if everything is working properly is shows a  little \"C\" on the screen (for connected and working properly)  When breaking it shows the breaking voltage applied to the trailer brakes.

Meaning with either model, you'll be emptying it midway through the job.A good way to tell if your extractor works properly on your car is to pump all the oil and then pull the drain plug. If nothing comes out, your car is empty and the pump worked. If oil comes out, the pump didn't get it all and you probably should drain rather than pump your car. In theory the pump can get more out than draining, since it goes to the bottom of the pan, whereas the plug typically has a lip that prevents it from draining all the oil.","reviewerID":"A1Z4GII5CHCDG7","unixReviewTime":1370995200}

{"asin":"B0034KH2K4","overall":3,"reviewText":"My Honda Accord needs one 26\" wiper and one 18\" blade. I see the only difference is the longer blades cost more money. Their look is the same, and they work the same. The longer blade also hugs the windshield. If your car requires two different sizes, I'd recommend that you check to be sure both sized blades are in stock or you may end up with only a single blade in this style. My review for this blade follows, but it's the same as I wrote for the 18\" blade:I did a little research on Wexco Industries while I was awaiting the very swift delivery of my AutoTex \"PINK\" - Black Bracketless Premium Wiper Blade - 26\" and learned that the company is woman owned, and began in 1991 as Wipers Express. According to their website, \"Today we are a global supplier of quality windshield wipers and engineered systems to the heavy duty bus, RV and other specialty markets.\" I trusted the newfangled design to work and it's been only average.  The longer blade does not hug the windshield and there's a section where the blade attaches to the arm that simply doesn't make contact, even after time. The label, \"PINK\" can imply that the blades are pink, but they are definitely black like most other windshield wiper blades. The \"PINK\" represents the company's partnering with the NBCF. Another plus for the product. Men, do not be turned off by the notion of blades with the pink ribbon insignia, it's very small and unobtrusive. It does not affect the functionality of this blade. Since I've replaced many wiper blades, this was very intuitive for me. If you are inexperienced, you can watch the video which I think designed to show how easy the process can be if you're not replacing rusted blades. The instructions are inside the box with an assortment of connectors for a majority of arm types, and there are additional diagrams and information on the box. They are written in English, Spanish and French. I like the blades and hope that they will work as well in inclement weather as they do in a slight rain.","reviewerID":"A1ZPY91VE3IDN1","unixReviewTime":1283126400}

How it works is you put a strip of semi-adhesive material along the edge of your door. It's not like packing tape but more rubbery. The problem with this is yes it will protect the edge of your door from paint flaking off if you ding it, however this won't protect your door from dents or larger dings like the thicker, rubber trim will that you can buy. So yes this will work to keep the paint in place and provide a bit of protection, but in my opinion this really isn't worth the money, it provides too little protection.I applied it to a Honda ridge-line truck, I have 4 doors and only got one set so 2 doors are protected, 2 are not. It's important you clean both the front, edge and back side of the door where the film sticks otherwise it will fall off.Once applied the film blends so you can hardly see it's on.Now I am not going to ding my door to test this, but from initial inspections it doesn't look like it does much good. It's like putting laminated piece of paper on your stomach and then getting hit. You are still going to feel it, its still going to damage but it will soften the blow....a little....It's a nice idea but for me this should be marketed as a \"as seen on TV\" item for those late night TV shoppers.

You'll need their viewer to see the map movement as the video plays.Update: 7-2010Tonights episode of Dirty Jobs showed this camera strapped to a head strap for the host, Mike Rowe, who was 408 feet above the cement floor decending & window cleaning in Hawaii.  Troy chickened out on the first 100 feet so alot of the contour HD footage made it into the show.  By the 300 foot balcony they got troy on the ropes but his hair got snagged in the safely line and had to get his second \"shearing\" on Dirty Jobs - it was also filmed on contour HD cams 300' above hawaii.  The quality was as good as the cable company could deliver in their 6:1 re-compression of HD.  A full HD viewfinderless camera has value when you must get the shot.using a sandisk 16GB microSD card and the maximum detail [1080P] + best quality I could get 3 hr, 6 minutes of video recorded with battery leftover.  If you use the lower resolution setting the battery may be the limiting factor - I have not tried that yet.I bought this to produce a bluray disc of a police helicopter team, using a gyro stabilized canon professional camera in back and wanting a 2nd angle up front.  This comes with an adhesive patch that sticks to the side of the pilot's helmet to give a 135 degree wide field of view.  The integrated rails on both sides permit the ultimate flexibility in mounting the camera, and second options for this cam are car mounts, etc.The quality is GREAT.  The lens is the downfall - there is some pincushion effect due to the inexpensive lens and wide angle.  I'll deal with it for the price and the shots you can get with it, plus I can trim out the distortion in post editing.One note - the output is .mov which is fine for macs, but for pc's you will need to transcode if you run premiere pro cs4 from adobe as it does not import .mov natively.  Perhaps that is a good time to clip the edges where the bent picture is most noticable.Another factor to like is the simplicity.  With gloved hands you slide the top forward to record and back to stop, with a beep to start and and double beep to stop - it's very hard to mess up except for your horizon, which is why there are detents and lasers.Detents and lasers?Yes, - there are detents in the event you mount it on the right and left hand side of a helmet or rotate it in a mount.  The 2 lasers can be turned on to tell you what is level with resepect to the imager.  This is helpful when you rotate it but you must manually keep track of the bottom of the screen (below the laser points ) as you rotate it, otherwise your output will be upside down.For the price, you simply can not beat it.  Buy a 16 GB sandisk micro-sd card to go with itSandisk 16GB Microsd CardNote that they have a low packaging option which the card is inside a plastic carrier and inside an ESD bag but no box or other trash with it that goes in the landfill - smart packaging.One of the other great applications for this is taking HD video where you otherwise would NOT take your $3K camera - the beach - the water park - etc.  You won't get the absolute best quality but you will get 1080 p hd that is playable on macs or pcs in native players!Another great use is for children.  It's easy to use, inexpensive, and highdef.  For the kids who are beyond the toy grade cameras but not ready for a professional unit, this fills the gap.  Adults will love its simplicity.  On or Off - no fancy buttons to press, and everything complex is set while attached to the computer.Finally there is my use - have a 2nd angle view for use with NLE systems.  You can now do a\/b video fades by time syncing the output from this camera with your primary cam.  Be sure to expose something that will sync the two that gets recorded on both at the start of shootng.I'm only deducting a star becuase of the pincushion effect of the lens.  I realize for this price you are not getting an HD lens, and I realize that HD will show any defects, but a few more dollars in the lens would have made this 5 stars - it is oh so close.  Be sure to pick up extra memory and batteries if you plan to use it at maximum definition because it makes some big files fast.","reviewerID":"A203OCQQ12MAVT","unixReviewTime":1260489600}

{"asin":"B001LHVOVK","overall":5,"reviewText":"The unit is great for what it is, and for how much it costs. I am yet to face the \"link error\" thing mentioned by others; so far, every vehicle I've checked connected well and gave out information. It is important to remember that the unit only retrieves codes and erases everything (permanent and pending codes, the state of the monitors and some adjustments made by the PCM over the time, like the long term fuel trim.)There are no code descriptions. There is no access to data streams. There is no access to freeze frame data. There is no built-in database of vehicles. There is no reading of proprietary non-OBD-II codes from systems like ABS, SRS or power steering. There is no need for updating the firmware. This is a very barebone OBD-II code reader, but in that capacity it works well. There is no internal battery that may leak. There is a bright LED inside that lights up the screen. Symbols on the screen are big and bold and the contrast is just right, and it is not hard to read at all. The body is all wrapped up in plastic and it looks reasonably water resistant. The cable is neither too long, nor too short; it also doesn't feel flimsy, but only the time will tell about that.Quality control at Autel may be inappropriate, because many people report reading errors that seem to be related to the cable, or the connector, or both, or to the internal soldering.The booklet that comes with the unit is a throwaway. The instructions seem to be outdated, but the unit only has two buttons and it is extremely easy to figure out what they do.","reviewerID":"A209NTWL1FX6ZD","unixReviewTime":1297987200}

I always overfill my tires by a few lbs and bleed off excess until the pressure is exact. I have used an Accugage for over 20 years and I still have it. This hose is somewhat stiff, but it is not bad and it does not interfere with use. As for this model not holding a reading, it doesn't need to. The proper way to use it is to depress the chuck onto the valve stem ONCE, bleed off excess, and then remove. None of this on, off, on , off stuff. The only people that do it that way are doing it wrong. Incidentally, the price is inexpensive. Actually it is cheap. A set of tires for my car costs about $1400 installed. I would pay whatever was necessary to ensure my safety. The cost of the gauge is trivial. Use it.......often.","reviewerID":"A20C7RI3X97FC2","unixReviewTime":1397692800}

Very little coffee got on the floor mats, but I immediately stopped at the nearest gas station and went in to wet this compressed towelette. Surprisingly, the texture and strength of this towelette was very good. If I had used paper towels they would have shred to pieces, but this stayed together nicely and completely cleaned the spill up. This is fairly lint free and very strong. I could also see frequent travelers\/hikers using these to wash their face and hands with only needing a little bit of water. The texture of these makes clean up very easy. I tried it on my own face and hands and it worked like a washcloth. The waffle weave fibers are very strong yet great at capturing dirt.

{"asin":"B00CSWEJZU","overall":4,"reviewText":"First of all, let me say that this towel truly does absorb water like the manufacturer boasts, which is rather rate nowadays. Props to that fact!The design is great, the tag removed easily, and the material also seems not to scuff paint\/clearcoat at all.Although, I personally am not a fan of the size of the towel.When it's full of water, I find it rather cumbersome to squeeze out, as you need to grab each section separately to squeeze it out, which becomes tiring if you're drying an entire decently-sized car. I found that I needed to squeeze out sections of four or five each time the towel became full, which was rather annoying.I would personally love this towel if it came in a smaller size, but when it's not warm enough for the water to evaporate off the surface of the car, squeezing out a towel of this size becomes a chore. Unfortunately, even though I love every other aspect of the towel, the size became an annoyance so I am mixed on whether to recommend it or not, as well as whether to return it or not.During the summer this towel will be great, but for when water won't evaporate (due to the fact that a moist towel leaves streaks, unless it's squeezed bone-dry, which is difficult) it's not as much of a pleasure to use.Edit: GCC, the manufacturer of this towel, has been absolutely delightful to deal with in communications, and I have the utmost respect for them.

Just use the sides to round off that tab, go slow and you will be good to go.All I can say is WoW... I can see now! The quality and build of these bulbs are superb, Made in Germany ( you know the Germans make good stuff).  IMO the BEST Bulb on the market! Don't fall for the blue tint is better as the blue tint is a color filter as WILL cut your light output! The silver labeled bulbs say they give you brighter light but they overdrive the bulb with end results a very, very, very short life. Those cheep HID kits that are not made for a stock reflector \/ lens and  is simply going to make your fellow oncoming car drivers mad. if you simply want brighter light that will help you be safe on the road this will work great for you!Quality, Clear Quartz, German made, INCREDIBLE Low price,and  long life...these bulb and simple mod is the way to go if you want to see what is in front of your WRX!I did use an inexpensive ceramic wiring harness extender available on Amazon2 x H11 Ceramic Male Female Type Wiring Fog Light Foglight Socket for Carto help protect my factory wires from the possibility of any additional heat from upgrading to the larger wattage bulb. This was a very easy modification and only takes about 15 min to make driving at night much less stressful!

{"asin":"B0033A5OQO","overall":5,"reviewText":"This is a very well made bag.  It has one very large zippered and plastic lined section, another smaller and plastic lined front pocket,  as well as a small water bottle sized section.  Between the front section and back section is a full length pocket, unlined, secured by a tab of Velcro.  The bag has carrying handles as well as an adjustable strap to fasten it to the car seat.I found that having it behind the car seat as shown made it more difficult for the driver to reach back and get the drink, as it is then at the other side of the car.  For a back seat passenger this would be fine.Instead I use the bag so that it hangs on the front passenger seat (when there is no passenger of course!). This leaves the water bottle pocket close to the driver and I am able to store all the stuff that accumulates in the car in the pockets (wipes, tissues, pens, cord for the mp3, magazines etc).  Then, if I have a passenger I simply flip it to the back part of the seat. I no longer have to clean all that stuff off of the seat before someone can get in.I would give it  4.5 stars if possible because I would have liked to see smaller pockets along the front for really tiny items (like gum, sunglasses and so on) as well as a way to unclip one side, to make it easier to remove from the car as needed.A really well made item, strong stitching, quality metal parts and clean design which makes me round it up to the 5 stars.","reviewerID":"A22I55P15NSAOX","unixReviewTime":1272067200}

{"asin":"B0015PI7A4","overall":3,"reviewText":"I wanted to get this because I seem to be the only \"car guy\" in the household and amongst extended family (some 20+ people all in Dallas).I do all of my own car work, and could easily do simple battery voltage checks with a multimeter, but a device like this is important, because it measures amps correctly (and simply), something you don't want to do with most multimeters without calculating the proper size resistor to use inline or risk frying your multimeter.  Basically, this is a device designed to measure automotive voltage, plus check cold cranking amps, cranking amps, and load testing.The 3 stars is mainly for the usability.  First, the display (the most important thing!) is hard to read because it uses large LED bars to write out the words.  Let me explain - the first test is the battery test.  When you select the battery test, it reads \"baFF\" rather than \"batt\" only because the manufacturer chose to use a very simplistic display that doesn't have enough \"bars\" to create easy to read words.  It's like trying to make words with a calculator if that makes any sense.  (I will try to upload a picture later)Next, of all devices that truly need a carrying case, this one does, if only to hold the instruction manual.  It is not intuitive to use without the manual (primarily because the words are very hard to decipher or read).  There's a \"glossary\" on the back, but it doesn't include everything, nor the steps for each of the tests, if it DID, I would've added 1 more star.Then, on top of that, the manual somewhat confuses you a little in determining what type of battery you have.  For example, for battery types you must choose from the following:SLI - Starting\/Lighting\/Ignition Flooded batteryFLAT - Traditionally shaped AGM batteriesSPL - AGM-designated spiral wound batteriesGEL - Gel cell batteriesNow of the 4, what type of battery do you have???  I checked 3 cars and none have any of this written on the battery themselves.  I can only assume SLI makes the most sense.  Ideally, this would be explained a little better or use \"Conventional, Marine\/Deep-Cycle, Maintenance Free\" wording instead.Overall, I feel 3 stars is fair for the usability - the item still works and seems to validate known good and known bad batteries and charging systems, but don't lose the instruction manual and good luck being able to read the too-simplistic screen.","reviewerID":"A22KGO6Q2YWS0C","unixReviewTime":1374019200}

Use a viair air pump and buy a battery clip one attachment into a 12 volt plug which will give you the leangh to go around your vehicle and will fill your tires in less then a minute . Do not use the 12 volt outlet for the viair air pump  it can't handle the amps in most cars .

{"asin":"B001GJ3DZS","overall":4,"reviewText":"I'll be honest, I'm not even sure exactly what part of the wheel this brush is supposed to clean.  But I needed a brush to clean the rims of my car (which were pretty dirty) and this generally did the trick.  First off, I did not use a high pressure water hose, just a normal one, this brush, and a bucket with car soap.  And by and large it helped get most of the grime gently off my rims.  The bristles are definitely soft, which is good because it won't scratch your rims.  At the same time though, because the bristles were soft, it was unable to get out some of the heavy dirt that was caked in.  Also, this brush has a relatively wide area so I could clean the outer surface of my tire and rim quickly.  However, because it was big, it was difficult getting access to the nooks and crannies of my rims.  For that, I recommend getting a Mother's Detail Brush which is more narrow (think of it as dental floss vs. toothbrush)Mothers Detail Brush Set - 2 Pack.  The brush itself is quite durable and ergonomic, and not too heavy.  One other issue I had is that once I cleaned my wheels once, a lot of dirt got into the bristles and i was unable to wash that color out.

{"asin":"B002HQTOU2","overall":2,"reviewText":"I've been detailing and cleaning my vehicles for the past 15 years. So I'm rather particular about what I use and how I clean the vehicles. Which is why I used this on a friends vehicle  (with their permission) who doesn't particularly care about how it looks. :)First of all, you should NEVER use any product like this on a dirty vehicle without washing it first. Otherwise you are simply rubbing dirt directly into the paint and you will have swirl marks. Especially if you have a dark colored vehicle. The vehicle should idealy be washed with pressure washer to remove large\/loose dirt (or reputable touchless wash if not available), and then with a wash mit and bucket (with grit guard) using car wash soap. If it's in the kitchen, don't use it. Car wash soap only please.Once you have a 99% clean vehicle, you may then proceed to use the Lucky Earth detailing kit. You can use this to clean up any spots you may have missed on the paint, wheels, or even glass if you feel like it. For this, the product got the job done. But then again, so does plain old H2O with a microfiber towel. Perhaps if you don't have clean water available, this would work. But then again, how did you wash the vehicle in the first place?Compared to the normal detailing products I have and currently do use such as Meguiars and Zaino... well, there is no comparison. These products do a far better job as cleaning, adding shine, protection, and even helping cover up swirls.The tire kit provides a matte finish (ie. not shiny). I'm not really sure if added any protection since it looks and feels the same as it did after it was washed with soap and water. But it did pick up more dirt. Once again, it's a tire. Water\/Towel would do the same thing. We won't bother comparing this to anything else.Then you have to consider the cost. This is somewhat pricey for a detailing kit. But I suppose that's the price you pay for earth-friendly products.Pros:* Earth-friendly.* Very nice towels* Removes water spots like you've never seen before* Did I mention the soft microfiber towels?Cons:* Expensive* Potentially costly and harmful washing directions* \"Non-earth friendly\" products do much better.Overall, I like trees too. But the Lucky Earth product only cleans stuff slightly better than water. And not how they claim it should. There is no way you are ditching traditional washing methods for a spray bottle on a dirty vehicle.My suggestion: If you need a detailing kit, buy well known products such as Meguiars and use them on cars only. Not trees. They are definitely car-friendly.","reviewerID":"A23QII83UGZP5U","unixReviewTime":1284595200}

You need to work on small sections. Wipe it on, then immediately wipe it off. A micro fiber towel works best for both application and removal. Working in the shade is an absolute must as well.One person can do it, but it helps to have two people. One to apply; the other to wipe it off. Working on my own it took me about 15 minutes to do the car (an Infiniti EX). Two people could easily do it in less than 10 minutes.I can't comment as of yet as to durability and longevity, but my car has never looked better.

As shipped, the side handles come inside the side straps. (making it difficult to use the handles until you take it apart and reassemble it \"correctly\") What purpose do the side straps serve?There is no handle on the top, so if you are going to carry this somewhere it is a \"two hand\" job using the side handles.  This is not your typical luggage bag.The basic idea is that this bag is normally collapsed and thus takes up almost no space.  However the metal supports, which are used to prop the bag in the open position, have nothing to secure them in the open position and thus the bag tends to collapse frequently.  Certainly this results in an exercise in frustration as you attempt to store items inside the bag.It's a nice bag, but I would prefer if they didn't bother putting in the metal frame which deludes you into thinking this is intended to be propped open.","reviewerID":"A25KVM6GJBLISZ","unixReviewTime":1279584000}

Application is simple enough, I prepped the window with Adam's Glass cleaner (best product out there). I followed by applying the Griot's Glass sealant as directed, in a crossed pattern. It dried very quickly, going from one arm reach to the other side of the car, and repeating, the other side was dry and ready for the second coat. I buffed it off with a microfiber cloth, and noticed how many imperfections my glass has.Two days later, it rained relatively lightly, it was a rain that was just to the point that you'd want an umbrella. At about 30 mph the beadlets began evacuating the windshield on my Honda Pilot. I'm sure that this speed will differ based on aerodynamics (or lack thereof with the Pilot). There is a noticeable difference in the bottom portion of the windshield, protected by the hood where the water isn't affected by the wind coming over the car.Used in conjunction with wipers on a heavier rain, the windshield was cleared far more effectively than using just wipers.

After I returned the first 5000 (because it had 12 screws that go into the roof), I received the special mounting model that doesn't require screws to be used on the roof - just four screws that secure the fan from the inside.

{"asin":"B00FDQPCR2","overall":5,"reviewText":"I've been using the 60 LED version of this light for nearly a year.  The 80 LED light is virtually identical, other than being brighter because of the extra 20 lights.  When you first get your light the battery is powered, but I recommend you follow the directions and let it charge for several days with the light switch in the off position to fully charge.  There are 3 settings to customize the light to your needs.  One sets the length of time the light will stay on when triggered. Another sets the sensitivity- or the distance at which movement is detected to trigger the light.  The third determines if the light will come on at dusk, dull daylight or if it will only come on if it's pitch dark.  The dials are marked form minimum to maximum for each of the three settings.  I don't know if its just me, but I find the dial markings cryptic, hard to see and somewhat worthless.  The only way I can get it set up is to turn each dial fully to one extreme and wave my hand in front of the sensor.  If the light comes on in a well lit room and stays on for a long time and I know I want it to only come on when it's pretty dark and maybe not stay on the maximum time, I can turn the time and \"Lux\" dial partway the opposite direction.  For my use, I like the sensitivity on MAX.Once, I had trouble with my 60 LED light when it quit working for no reason.  I contacted the manufacturer and they did a great job of troubleshooting the problem.  The fix was to switch it off for a couple of days and let it charge and reset.  After doing that, I've never had another problem since.  Both of my lamps are somewhat sheltered under the eaves of the house but the solar panels are fully exposed to the elements and I haven't had any problems with water effecting either the light or the solar panel.I'm completely sold on these lights.

The skull graphic is printed on one side and is slightly less soft than the unprinted side but it didn't bother me in the least.  It covers the full forehead down to about the mid throat.  With a stocking hat it covers the full head.Warmth: 100% warm. I've tested it at -15 F with a decent wind driving the windchill down to the -25 F or better range.  No problem.Fit: good.  It's obviously not tailor made for my face or head, but it's got plenty of adjustment in the Velcro strap and stays where you put it.  Warm air does leak up into the eye opening so wearing with glasses or goggles doesn't work well (depending on ambient temp, of course).Usability for running: The first problem I ran into was that the breathing holes are too small for sustained aerobic activity.  Once I got up to about an 8:30 pace I felt like I was breathing through a hose.  I didn't pass out but it was definitely restrictive.  I stuck with it for 3.5 miles before I tore the mask off.  The second issue related to very cold weather was that frost had started to close off some of the small breathing holes, making the breathing increasingly difficult.  I could have kept going but I decided that a cold face was more enjoyable than restricted breathing.  Although my face was so toasty from the 3.5 miles with the mask that I easily went another 3.Overall, even though it doesn't really work well for what I had hoped it gets 4 stars since I'll be able to use it for many other cold weather activities, it fits well, is of good quality and looks cool.

Each of them had multiple scratches and aberrations, ranging from deep gouges to surface abrasions. I will discuss each.DEEP SCRATCHESAs expected, this kit will not remove deep scratches alone. Only sanding can do that. With this in mind, using bottles 1 and 2 multiple times will blur the edges some, making them appear less stark\/apparent.MEDIUM SCRATCHESThis is where I started to see the benefits of the kit. Medium scratches started to fade more obviously, and I saw several of them be downgraded to &#34;light scratches&#34;. Again, I had to go over the imperfections several times with bottles one and two.LIGHT SCRATCHESWill only a small amount of elbow grease, light scratches were all but removed. This was the most pleasing part of using the whole kit - although I wasn't surprised.BUFFINGAnother part I was pleased with was using bottles 2 & 3 to give each case a shiny appearance. You may not realize it, but micro-abrasions will give any plastic an overall dull appearance - the kit does an excellent job at buffing these out and giving your item a real shine.OVERALLThis is a decent kit that does a pretty impressive job on smaller scratches.

I told him it was almost 4 years old and he could not believe it. I have to admit that the car does look like due to wonderful Mothers products and some elbow grease.Mothers Carnauba Wax is one of the weapons in keeping my car looking good.I start by washing my car. I don't dry it as this time as water drops will be removed by other steps. Then I clay the car to remove embedded specs, stuck on dirt, and this year I had rubber marks from clearing the snowMothers 07240 California Gold Clay Bar Paint Saving System. I don't clay every inch of the entire car. I just examine the car by sight for any imperfections and by my running my hand over the paint to feel any tiny bumps. When I feel some grittiness or see some dirt on the paint, I generously spray that section with Mothers Showtime Instant Detailer, then knead the piece of clay in my hand and rub it against the spot I identified. Normally, you see the dirt disappear in a few swipes. Sometimes you need to reapply the Detailer and repeat. Kneading is important as you want to work the little pieces of dirt into the clay, and not leave it on the surface of the clay ball where it can scratch the car. I also use the clay on non-painted areas such as glass and chrome if they have stains.After the claying step I wax the car is small sections using Carnauba Wax. It easy to work with.  I put it on a small section (each side of the car is done in 4 sections, for example), by the time I am done spreading it, it is ready to be wiped off, you don't have to wait.  I use micro fiber towels to wipe the wax, using a fresh piece of the fiber on each section.As my final step I apply Back-to-blackMothers 06108 Back-To-Black - 8 ozto non-painted surfaces. This turns the dull plastic into shiny new looking surface. Back-to-black is also effective in removing any wax that might have accidently got on the plastic, that's why I do back-to-black as the last step.Carnauba Wax gives a superior shine.

Obviously nobody is going to carefully measure their dilution ratios so they can wash their car.1 or 2 pumps, whatever makes me feel froggy that day. Citrus Wash & Gloss or Mr. Pink, either\/or - doesn't matter.My only complaints on these pumps are that if you tilt the gallon jug over, product will leak. Also when you are done pumping, a little more will dribble out. The way to combat this is to tilt the container over to drain the top portion of the pump, and voila - no more drips. Either way, you'll be best to hit the end with a rag and probably not let it drip down on expensive stuff. Like your buffer\/polisher.Unfortunately, trying to find gallon pumps anywhere is like a needle in a haystack and the options are limited here. Small variety and this is probably the only worthwhile pump on Amazon. At over $8 a piece they are also kind of expensive.But hey - would you rather fight a funnel and a heavy jug when you want some chemical?So a cool thing about these is that they screw down into place. Unfortunately, when you screw the pump down and lock it, it's also the very same as hitting the pump one time. So make sure you have that rag ready... but it's nice because my garage shelving is *JUST* a tad too short to accommodate the Chemical Guys gallon containers and this pump extended. Such is life, tho... Just have to fight locking them into place and losing that ~.5oz of product every time.","reviewerID":"A2DFINH7PH42RK","unixReviewTime":1393891200}

{"asin":"B003V3PZOY","overall":3,"reviewText":"I am a car and car care nut.  I have shelves of products.  No, make that a whole closet full.  The best features of this kit are the excellent packaging.  The products, themselves, are just OK.  My overall rating is 3 stars.First, I'll say something about the packaging.  That is one of the best features of Griot's products. For example, the Speed Shine comes in a nice wide-base round bottle with a quality sprayer. When you are detailing a car, I can't stand cheap bottles with junky sprayers that are thin and fall over easily. Often, you are carrying multiple things in your hands and need to rest the bottle down on something and having it fall over all the time and dribble out or pick up dirt is just irritating!  The bottle is very high quality and clear so you can see how much is left and where the end of the pickup tube is.  Similarly, the clay come in a nice, screw top jar with ample space.  Every other clay I've used comes in some cheap cellophane wrapper or some tiny box and getting it back into, well, anything to protect it is nearly impossible.  Hats off to Griot's on the packaging\/containers.First up, this contains a generous lump of paint clay.  You can read about claying a car elsewhere but the basic idea is it's a very good part of the prep process for polishing\/waxing a car.  The clay in this kit is of a fairly mild type.  It's kind of hard to explain, but there are aggressive clays that are for really poor condition paint that will also start to remove sealants and such, and there are mild clays which remove less contaminants but are more gentle on the paint.  And, there are some in between.  This follows the tradition of most Griot's products that I have used in that it is mild and relatively fool-proof for the beginner but better suited towards well-maintained cars.  The generous lump can be kneaded and used on many cars depending on the level of dirt\/contamination.  High rating for a mild clay that can be used frequently and comes in a best-in-class jar.This kit also contains 35oz of Speed Shine which can be used as a clay lubricant.  Speed Shine is technically a quick detailer for used on a slightly dusty car with microfiber towels, but in this kit, it is used as a clay lube.  There are a lot of products that can be used as a clay lube.  In this case, this product works fine.  I also used Speed Shine as a quick detailer (its original use).  For that, I was less impressed.  It seemed to leave a lot more streaks and the lubricity was not as good as competing products that I've used.  The bottle and sprayer are excellent, though.In sum, this is a good, but not impressive kit.  I would be tempted to just buy the clay separately.  There are other better quick detailers out there (Finish Kare #425 is one of my favorites), but if you are new to detailing, this kit will serve you well, and you will appreciate the quality containers which you can reuse.","reviewerID":"A2EHYCA29NSQLU","unixReviewTime":1358899200}

There are two On positions, but both of them seem to produce the same dispersion. Even indoors or with no wind, the mist is so fine that much is wasted. If there is any kind of wind, forget about even trying. Ultimately, the bottle is so bad that I would not buy this again.

Yes, the extendable handle could be longer, but I also have another type of SUV brush that can handle that task.  This brush is perfect if you drive a small to intermediate size vehicle like a Corolla, Civic, Sentra or Elantra.I bought mine off of Amazon without realizing they sold these at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond and could have gotten it cheaper with the use of a 20% coupon.  Then again, I have an aversion to shopping in malls and stores so the price was fair and worth it.  I imagine it will hold up just fine, but I imagine it might be a challenge to remove heavier, wet snow.  An alternative brush with stiffer bristles like the other one I have may work better.  Construction appears to be solid and built well.EDIT 2\/4\/14:  Tried using it on more wet, heavier snow today after a snow storm dumped 4 inches.  As anticipated, the wetter snow caused the bristles to become heavy and clogged a bit.  If you are going to store it in your car after removing this type of snow, it will cause quite a wet mess.  Bang off or brush against your car tire to minimize the melt off.  The brush still did its job, but once the bristles are heavy and wet it starts to get a bit more challenging.  I still give it 4 stars, just be aware that this will happen.","reviewerID":"A2GTDAC4M9DYJ5","unixReviewTime":1391040000}

I ordered this kit hoping it would be of good components and well contructed, and it appears to be just that.

The bulbs throw a very bright, well-defined pattern that is cutoff on top by my stock reflector housings.  I have them aimed just a little lower than the stock setting as to not blind oncoming traffic and I have not been flashed once.

{"asin":"B0009IQXXG","overall":1,"reviewText":"I'm generally a big fan of the Meguiar's products, and use them for washing, drying, waxing, etc.  Got this thinking it would be a good addition to the lineup.  However, not only does it not really add much to the overall look, but the application method is all wrong.This product comes as a spray, and is designed, as per the instructions, to spray right onto the tires.  After doing so, it does make the areas where applied shiny, but the application is uneven, and even then, because it's a mist, it goes everywhere (onto the paint, the wheels, etc), which is bad.  So you end up having to use something like a paper towel or a cloth to spread the product evenly, which ends up removing most of the product (and making a mess overall).  Then the shine is gone.This product would be better made as a bottle that is made to apply to a pad or some other applying tool, as the spray is too difficult to control to get it only on the tires.Since evening it out also means removing most of the shine, whatever soaks in leaves a dull but darker look.  So, in the end, the best it was able to do was darken the tires slightly.  The product briefly mentions protective qualities, so a star for that, but it seems like an afterthought in the advertising materials, so I'm somewhat doubtful about that.  So overall, this product doesn't seem worthwhile; it's more trouble than it's worth.  It basically made a mess, made the tires darker, but duller looking, and made the logos\/letters\/numbers on the tires less visible, which in the end made it look less cool than before.  So, I won't be using this particular product again.Other Meguiar's products are great; but this one is not an essential.  It seems like a very niche product that one would only need for special photo shoots, etc, in a controlled environment, but not as an everyday car polishing tool.","reviewerID":"A2HD6G443MGH2A","unixReviewTime":1402099200}

According to the write up page the kit will transform your car, boat, or RV into an eye-popping visual showpiece, with Omni Lighting Systems (OLS) Motor Series by PPA. I have to agree that the lighting is unusual and neat. I installed inside my Jeep Wrangler. While the write up by the manufacturer says that the installation is a quick easy set up that takes you from dull to dazzling in minutes, brilliantly illuminating dash and floorboards, door panels, cabinets, closets, galleys, bow and stern sections. It is not difficult to install however let me caution, you need patience and use a trial and error approach to see what works best for you. The instructions are OK but not the best. The  24-key remote offers sixteen incredible color options, as well as various cosmetic features. Be sure and keep the remote so it can view the controller otherwise your remote will not work properly.  Dim or brighten, flash and fade, or effortlessly toggle across four spectacular preset lighting displays. Double-sided tape and Velcro strips (included) provide two installation options to ensure LED strips can easily be removed, yet also remain secure once in place.

{"asin":"B000DZXIJM","overall":5,"reviewText":"I've owned Jeep Wranglers for seven years now. I switched from a traditional cleaner-wax product because Jeep Wranglers have black plastic hard-tops (well, during the winter at least!), black plastic fender flares, black plastic mirror housings, and on the newer Wranglers, black plastic bumpers and door handles and assorted other trim. A traditional wax applied to any of those turns them white, but if you don't treat them with something, they fade to an ugly mottled gray over time. Thus the Turtle Wax Ice, which can be applied to everything -- hard top, fender flares, bumpers, and the Jeep itself. This allows me to make my whole Jeep shine without worrying about getting some white residue on things that aren't supposed to have white residue.Note that this cannot be used on glass, it just streaks. So to make your glass  and mirrors nice and shiny and keep them from fogging up easily in the winter, you'll still need a traditional wax, not a polymer-based product (note - do not apply to exterior front or back glass, just to interior glass and to the side windows!). The same is true for plastic windows on Jeep soft tops, a traditional wax will keep them from turning yellow and help keep them scratch-free, a polymer product like this will just make them streaky. And if you're looking at a deteriorated finish or one with baked in bugs and tar, use some other product first to recondition your finish, don't use this on a badly oxidized or bug-and-tar-spattered paint job. So this product (and other similar polymer products) is not a solution for all protective purposes, but it sure does work well where it does work.","reviewerID":"A2ICKE6A3MJMM5","unixReviewTime":1323734400}

Don't forget to loosen the lug nuts on the bad tire before you get it off the ground, can be tough to keep the tire still while you try to get the lugs off. The best thing is that you don't have to remove horses from the trailer to change the tire. It can be extremely dangerous to take horses off a trailer on the side of the road.

The reason a new car looks so good is because the paint it polished and free of oxidation and continents.

It supposedly lasts a year and is fully removable by peeling it off.  For me, the best places to apply are front bumper and front leading edge of the hood.  Bare in mind that a can of the stuff doesn't cover much.  A full hood is 2 cans.  The leading edge of the hood is about 1 can.  The front bumper is 1 can.  The kit includes some wax to apply after you clean the surface--this is to make removal easier.  Applying the spray is pretty easy after you mask off areas adjacent to where you are spraying (plastic sheeting and tape included).  The spray is thicker than spray paint and is self-leveling, making it easy to apply.  Don't be worried that the spray is milky opaque at first--it will dry into a nice shiny clear surface.  The spray will cure in a few hours but is rain fast after a few days.Because of the prep and cure\/rainfast times, I would recommend this for dedicated car enthusiasts.  It certainly is not as simple as cleaning and waxing your car.  So far, I can confirm that the Defender leaves a thin, uniform surface that is clear and shiny.  I will try to update later on durability and performance of the product but so far it has been a breeze to apply and the results are great!PROS:-complete kit (everything you will need)-easy to apply-great results-easy to remove (provided you applied the wax)CONS:-takes hours to cure and days to achieve rain fastness-only lasts 1 year-spray nozzle clogs easily after one period of use--don't expect to save any for a later project!","reviewerID":"A2JP9E1H0SF392","unixReviewTime":1390435200}

Larger enough that I could see a small but steady stream from beneath the vehicle.  Replacing the heater core would have been a major job requiring removal of the entire dash, seats, and more.  I was debating if the time had come to send her to the crusher.  With very low expectations, figured I would give this produce a shot.I stopped at the local parts store and joked with the counter person that I was buying a bottle of \"miracle in a can\".  He replied that people had actually had pretty good results.I got home. poured it into the radiator and expected it not to work.  Sure enough, after a few minutes the leak seemed to stop.  As the car reached full operating temp I again noticed some leaking and smugly assumed I had been proven correct.  But alas, a few more minutes passed and the trickle went to a drip, and then to nothing.  I let it run for a good hour with a pan underneath.  Sure enough, it worked just as advertised.  The leak has not returned.  The rest of the system is working as it should, temp guage right where it should be, heater blowing hot and dry.  This tells me that it fixed the leak and has also not blocked up anything it should not.It is extremely rare that any of these \"miracle in a bottle\" products live up to their claims.

I finally opened this extension cord up and tried to use it. NOTHING! I thought that maybe I needed to check the fuse? So I did and guess what. It didn't even have the capability of using a fuse.

The only hangup I have on the mitt design is that the scraper itself has an elongated point extended toward the left to get the hard to reach places such as around window trims or under the windshield wiper and the direction that it's facing is made for left handed individuals.  I'm right handed so it's a little awkward using it to getunder the windshield wiper.  If the point were going in the opposite direction, I'm sure it would feel more natural to me.

My wheels are all beat up, and I can't tell what they do as far as scratching goes.Most alloy wheels have a clear coat on them, just like the painted parts of the car.  These brushes will surely scratch your wheels if you use it on nicen new wheels with the clear coat.  I tested this on one of the rear wheels where the clear coat was still pretty pristine, and using a 10x magnifying loupe before and after cleaning, this brush produced scratches.  I will NOT be using these on my new car.No one will notice the clear coat scratches on your wheels.  So take my advice with a grain of salt.  If you clean your wheels with this brush, spend about $20.00 on a good sealant, such as Klasse All-In-One, or better yet, Gtechniq 1.5 Silo Seal.  These are wipe on, wipe off liquids that will help protect your clear coats.  So scratch up the rims if you must, but at least put on some protection after.I'm becoming OCD when it comes to detailing my auto, so I'll stick to hand-scrubbing my wheels with a foam finger mitt.Recommended for people who just want to see clean stuff - this does the job!

The indicator light was glowing \"yellow\" (meaning it was charging) and then turned solid \"green\" after a few hours (the charging current of this particular model is small so the process is pretty slow), and I just left it connected after that.Overall I am very satisfied with this unit - it is pretty compact, very inexpensive (especially compared to ridiculously overpriced Mercedes-rebadged CTEK chargers\/maintainers), waterproof (I already tested, we had thunderstorm a couple of days ago), fully automatic unit with a good warranty. The only couple of minor drawbacks I can see are that the included cable (the one with alligator clips) is a little bit short (though there's an extension available for extra money, which I already purchased) and that there's no carrying case included.

(Less the bucket and water)  Park your car in a shady place and hose it off to cool it down real good.  Use the peanut sponge and the Gold Soap on the right of the picture (you only need a cap or two per gallon of water) and wash the car off really well.  The soap smells like candy while you're washing.  Makes you wanna eat your car.  After you're good and clean hit the rims ONE AT A TIME with the purple (middle) bottle.  They tire cleaner is safe on clear coated rims too.  Don't let it sit too long before you wipe and rinse your rims.  The white tire foam should turn brown after a few seconds when it comes into contact with brake dust and dirt.  Once your car is spotless and clean, it's time to dry it.  Microfiber cloth that's included does the job here.  Ring it out really well every so often so it drys your car completely.  Then comes the red bottle (far left) and the round applicator sponge.  Do not get this wax on anything but your paint!  And don't use too much because a little goes a long way!  If you have vinyl\/rubber trim around your windows be VERY CAREFUL!  It will leave a white waxy residue if you get it on it since it's (duh!) wax.  After you wax the entire car get another completely dry microfiber cloth.  Go to where you originally started waxing and start buffing it out with 4 inch circles or infinity loops.  The wax should be dry(ish) while you're doing this.  Don't be afraid to use a different piece of the cloth if you get a little build up of wax.  Once your car is buffed out you should be good.  You can use the Black spray bottle on your interior.  It's good on almost all surfaces except cloth.  The red spray bottle is touch up for your wax coat.  I had bird poop on my car the next morning after I waxed it and I used a microfiber cloth and it wiped right away.  Nothing could stick to it.  Then I used the red spray and buffed it back out.  The red spray bottle is also good for getting rid of water spots after it rains on your fresh wax job.  The bottles will tell you to do pretty much exactly what I just told you.  If you do it right, your car should gleam for a week easy!","reviewerID":"A2NGLQZKRHT4J3","unixReviewTime":1375660800}

There are 10 spokes, and two sides to each spoke, so if you clean them all individually it can be a real pain.  Using this method it takes me about 15 minutes to clean all four wheels - which is longer than it takes to clean the rest of the car.This is a very thick, full brush which gets down in between spokes and cleans them well.  This is far quicker than a sponge baton, microfiber mit, or rag.  I find I can clean the same 10 spoke wheels in about half the time with this brush.  The handle length is a bit awkward to hold with one hand.  Due to its length I find using two hands much more comfortable.  One thing to note is that the bristles are fairly soft.  So if you have any baked on brake dust or tough stains, you're probably going to have to scrub the wheels with a different brush.

I took a Scotch Brite pad to the remaining rust and it came right off.2. Battery Corrosion in Flashlight (three AAA batteries were in a flashlight in my car for two years)Results: I soaked the corroded battery holder (the plastic piece that held the three AAA batteries inside the battery case) for two days and most of the corrosion was gone. This was after I tried using baking soda. A quick hit with a tooth brush sealed the deal. The metal contacts are not perfect, but clean enough that I can use the mini-flashlight after it went unused for at least years! The corrosion inside the aluminum flashlight was fixed with baking soda, but if it was any worse I would have soaked the corroded portion in the solution.Overall, this is a good non-toxic product. The are faster alternatives, but it's safe, reusable and can last for years if you keep it sealed.Next on the testing block will be an old rusted pressure plate from my Nissan Silvia clutch and a bunch of rusted bolts.To be continued....4\/14 Update:I filled two Quart containers with oily, rusted bolts that I found around the garage and added Evapo-Rust. After one day, the bolts looked a little better, but nothing amazing. Day two looked better. On day three, you could see a layer of crud building up at the bottom of the containers. I decided this was long enough, so I dumped them in the sink and grabbed a clean rag.The remains of the rust wiped right off most bolts. The rust that was REALLY invasive, didn't come completely off, but I have no doubt another few days would have done it.While you can recycle Evapo-Rust, it was so dirty from the oil and rust remains, I decided to get rid of the used portion. Overall, 98% of the bolts look like new (in addition to a few rusted nut driver bits that I threw in for good measure) so I can't complain. If you are in a rush, you may want to try something else, but I like what I've seen so far.In terms of the chemicals, there was little to no skin irritation on my hands, so that's a big plus!","reviewerID":"A2OB0IK83HTU18","unixReviewTime":1396742400}
{"asin":"B009XR48MM","overall":3,"reviewText":"I thought this would be a quick and easy solution to muffling the rattles emanating from a 1998 ford.  I was wrong. The product is a fairly hard black vinyl with an adhesive back.  Designed to be used on metal surfaces, it must be applied when temperatures are higher than 40 degrees farenheit. The surface must be thoroughly cleaned. The mat may be sized by cutting with scissors or in my case an exacto knife.The backer is removed and the mat is positioned.  Then ideally, the mat will fit securely and the offending noises muffled. If necessary you may use a blow dryer or heat gun.Sounds great. But it isn't quite so easy. First, it being winter in NY, I had to wait until the temperatures rose. I had planned to use this in a door. But the material is inflexible, cuttable, but still inflexible. Worse, I couldn't get it to stick in position. So I wound up taking it off. My brother then took the remainder for the back floor of his suv. He had better luck getting it to stick using a heat gun. He is satisfied with its noise muting capabilities.This product was not for me. Unless you are adept at accessing the offending parts and fairly handy, this requires significantly more work than the package suggests. When properly applied, it does seem to work. I wonder if the adhesion is effected by heat as well as cold. Obviously, the material becomes more brittle in the cold and does not adhere. Conversely, in high summer heat, does it melt or become gooey? I dodn't know. I think the product can perform adequately but unless you are experienced with this type of installation, I would pass.","reviewerID":"A2OCDK0BOW6UCY","unixReviewTime":1365379200}

To make the electrical connection, I had to pry the wires from the base slightly.  Once I did that, and ensured that the polarity was correct, all of the LEDs in the bulbs came on.

Though these are advertised as being \"white\" the color of the light was a cool light blue, casting a not-at-all warm light.  The difference in light color and light intensity between these LED bulbs and my regular incandescent filament bulbs was dramatic.

The wax is the texture of butter you just got out of the fridge so it's stiff enough not to glob on your pad but soft enough to smear.2. The was goes on evenly and smoothly. I did the vehicles by hand to ensure good coverage.3. The wax dried to a soft white haze very quickly and buffed off pretty easily using microfiber towels. It leaves very little residue after the first pass but you will need to buff out an area at least twice to get all the wax off.4. After doing both vehicles I've used about 1\/4\" of the wax so this can is going to last a long time.5. It smells really good. Waxing a vehicle takes some time to complete so not having to put up with an unpleasant chemical smell is a plus.Cons:1. Takes work. Think Karate Kid \"...wax on, wax off...\". This wax requires elbow grease to get the best results.2. I normally use an orbital polisher to apply the wax and buff it out by hand. I can't think of a way to use that tool with paste wax (I normally use liquid wax). If you normally use an orbital I'd think twice about using this.3. Staying power. I live in the Southwest where the sun really takes a toll on vehicles. I don't enjoy waxing my vehicles but having to do it only once or twice a year helps. I don't know how long this will last and there are no indications on the can. If it hangs tough, I'll come back and update this review accordingly.In summary, if you don't mind taking the time to hand detail your vehicle, you can't go wrong with this wax. It ultimately boils down to the appearance of the shine and this wax excels in that area.","reviewerID":"A2PK64OVZA1U8Z","unixReviewTime":1368662400}

{"asin":"B0002JN2EU","overall":4,"reviewText":"I think of lot of guys use this for the smoke show it produces out the tail pipe.Pay no attention to most of the Youtube videos you see about this product:almost all of those people are using it wrong.WRONG WAY: start car, pour seafoam into fuel, oil and PCV valve or carburetor (or similarentry point to the cylinders) and then stamp on the gas hard until it looks likesomeone detonated a hydrogen bomb in your neighborhood.RIGHT (and more mature & informed) WAY: start car, let it warm, pour in Seafoam tofuel, oil and cylinders.  Once all used, TURN OFF CAR.  Let sit for at least 5 minutes(preferably 15) and then turn the car back on and DRIVE IT somewhere, aggressivelybut not irresponsibly.  Do so for 20 minutes or so or at least until the smoke dissipates.Most cars don't need this treatment but I can see it on an older car or a vehicle that'sbeen abused and requires a full tune-up.Be ever mindful that the deposits you liberate from the engine may, in fact, be all thatholds the motor together.  Oil might not lubricate as well (or at all) if the clearances betweenbearings are so wide (without the deposits in place) that it can't reach them.  Take care whenusing this product, and do so responsibly.Better idea: run 20% Marvel Mystery oil in your crankcase (use 1 of each 5 quarts as MMO), add 4 or 5ounces of it (per 10 gallons) to the fuel, and pour some down the carburetor (or into PCV valve or acarefully-selected vacuum line) ) once the car is started.  Don't go crazy with the amount you pour intothe engine directly.  Run it in a new oil change: use cheap (but new) oil.  Use a cheap (but decent)  oilfilter like a Fram ExtraGuard [the Orange Can].  Run for 2-4 weeks.  Change oil again with a good filter(Motorcraft are my favorites but Purolator and Mobil 1 are great as well) and decent oil (preferably synthetic)and watch the crap drain out with the oil\/Marvel Mystery Oil combo.  Continue to run good oils and filtersfrom then on, and perhaps repeat this procedure every few years or as you believe it necessary.Seafoam is a far more aggressive crankcase cleaner (flush) solution which fewer cars are inbad enough condition to require.  But for those that are, it works well.  Just use correctly andresponsibly.  And beware that it may clean out exactly what was holding the motor together all thoseyears.  Still, few vehicles will have that problem.","reviewerID":"A2PRK4GZL6SQUJ","unixReviewTime":1375488000}

I was trying to decide between the pillow style and thin foil style light blocking solutions and I decided to try the pillow style.  The package arrived quickly and the product was in new condition as expected.  This pillow is a friction fit design that fits snug in the standard roof vent opening.  I like the fact taht the one side is a white wool like finish and the other side is the reflective foil.With the reflective foil up and the white side down this thing blends right in with our white camper ceilings and it appears to have made a big difference in the room temperature on hot days.  I love the fact that it blocks the excess light in the morning and didn't require velcro or some other method for securing it.Given the choices that are out there (this pillow style, the foil cover, or the pull blind) I would take these every time.

Impressive, considering the purchase price.Checking out the details before and after purchase revealed severe issues when checking for proper operating and maintaining the unit.The manual(s) for the unit, either the one that came with the item or the one online, call for a immediate charge upon receipt of either 12 hours or 24 hours. The times for charging after use or regular storage differ dramatically as well.Contacted the manufacturer. Answer was that \"it does not matter if 12 or 24 hours\". So why wasting a 12 hour charge if it does not matter and the unit still has full capacity? Does it have full capacity? Answer \"Should not be critical\". What???Contacted the manufacturer again regarding maintaining the charge after use or when in storage. Was told that \"it does not really matter\", just charge it every 90 days.This is in complete contradiction to the 2 different manuals for this unit. Lack of quality, an American issue, still present.So what is there to do now? Sure it will start a vehicle once, then how is it supposed to be charged? How is it supposed to be charged when not in use? How long will it last?Well, it is a small and supposedly powerful unit, so lets wait and see.Update:Ran the 1000 amp battery on a conversion van completely down (listening to weather radio when the tornado hit a few weeks ago at a Michigan campground). Turned everything off in the car and attached the unit to the battery, then waited about 3 minutes (should be common sense, to allow electricity to float and settle). The little unit turned the engine over with no effort at all. It certainly provided a satisfactory effect first (by not being stranded) and a \"wow\" effect right after. Quite a accomplishment for a small unit like that.The unit was recharged for some hours calculated from the different statements the manufacturer made, somehow in the middle.

Even with that these would not conform to the flooring, they lay on top.It would take several more purchases in order to cover the whole area; there are numerous other products out there that seem more reasonable in cost. With this partial coverage there is no difference in the sound level and I have no confidence that these will stay on with the constant loading and unloading of items, since they refuse to stick to the whole flooring, but just the tops of the wide  grooved surface - wish they would state that surface must be completely flat.

{"asin":"B0041TQS5M","overall":5,"reviewText":"This is the 2nd TYC air filter I've purchased.  The 1st one was for my Honda CRV, which fit great, so I purchased this one for my Honda Fit.  Easier to replace than my old CRV.As others have noted, the TYC filter has three strips of glue and require an easy snipping of the adhesive on the opposite ends.  What you want is to be able to have the end walls separate from the rest of the pleats so you can seat the filter properly into the frame.  It is a very easy step, a scissor or a knife will work, you may even be able to tear and separate the adhesive with your hands if you are careful enough.  It's so simple, I wouldn't even dock it any stars.  So, on the Fit, open your glove compartment, take out all the junk you have in there, just squeeze in the sides of the glovebox walls, drop the glovebox lower (it's hinged so it won't fall off) and you have access to the cabin filter frame in the back.  Release the left and right clips and slide out the frame with the air filter.  Replace with new filter and put everything back together.Remember to note the direction of the air flow (I believe it's downward) and remember to seat the filter properly.  You should see a little \"lip\" like protruding plastic part on the frame (opposite ends).  Slide your filter into this part (both ends), you want to do so or there will be air that can possibly get bypass the filter.  It is because of this part on the frame and the full coverage of adhesive on the TYC filter that causes a conflict.Please let me know if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.","reviewerID":"A2VCXIAWCPQ13P","unixReviewTime":1369958400}

Be Careful though, the resoviour sucks in fluid extremely fast so be careful not to let it run dry or your system is going to have air trapped inside it, which isnt to hard to get out. On my Pathfinder, i replaced pretty much all of the old fluid as the return hose started spewing purple oil after a while. In all, it took 5 of these bottles, i barely had any left so i was cutting it close. During the test drive afterwards, i can say the steering is improved, not by a ridiculous amount, but it was def noticable, but that might not mean much as i havent changed the PS fluid for 90k miles and the old fluid was almost dark-brown\/black. When i say \"improved\" i mean the steering was a bit easier, much smoother, imagine putting your hand on top of a bar of soap sitting on a table top, then turning your hand in a circular motion, thats how smooth it felt compared to my old fluid. Now to the fluid itself, I believe that Royal purple products are well made, except they advertise alot, and their products are overpriced. Still that does not diminsh the worth and quality of this power steering fluid. Bottom line, would i get their products again?

{"asin":"B000BNYMX2","overall":4,"reviewText":"People need to understand about motor oil to make the decision on what is right for them including if Royal Purple is what they should use or not.  Forget the marketing, and anything else that suggests this or any oil will do anything \"spectacular\".  What it can do is what a good motor oil can do, lubricate and help protect an engine from wear (when combined with a good filter). The synthetic oils benefits occur most when an engine is subjected to the extremes, high RPM, high stress, high\/low temp situations where it will remain effective better than a conventional oil. Synthetic oils may also maintain their original properties a while longer than conventional oils.  That is it however. That is very important stuff, what motor oil is for. That is good enough, all that should be expected. But it is still motor oil. Any claims of this or any other oil making your car go faster or get better MPG or anything like that should not be believed. That is not the job of motor oil.The definition of \"synthetic oil\" in this Country is vague and most oils labeled \"fully synthetic\" are not made from 100% synthetic base stocks. To find out more about how this works look up Mobil Vs Castrol, this was the lawsuit in this country that allowed oils that originated from dino oil to legally be called \"fully synthetic\".  This does not mean they are bad oils, just that the use of the work synthetic can be misleading.One would need to look to see what base stocks are used to see just how fully synthetic an oil truly is. The base stocks in motor oil are Group I,II,III,IV and V base stocks. Group I-III (1-3) are all conventional mineral oils that have come from the ground. Dino oil. Only Group IV and V use synthetic base stocks (P.A.O. for group IV) and (Esters for group V).95% of oils labeled \"fully synthetic\" actually begin with group III base stocks which are then highly processed in to the final product.This does not mean that an oil is bad because it is not a true \"fully synthetic\" oil using 100% group IV or V base stocks or better just because it does use them, but this is something I think is misleading and not understood by most. Though being a true group IV oil using those P.A.O. base stocks is considered better by many. It is an indication of a high quality oil, and certainly meets the definition of a true fully synthetic oil, just not the only consideration.There is much more to an oil than just the base stocks used. The formulations are very complex including many additives with detergent and anti-wear properties along with several others. Many factors go in to making a top quality motor oil.I would not suggest one think they can go incredibly long times between oil changes just because they are using a high quality oil or because a certain mileage figure is on the label. When used with a good filter one may be able to go longer between changes with a good oil, but to protect your engine better you also need to keep clean and fresh enough oil of any type in it. This oil is no exception. Your oil may be capable of outlasting your filter. Some find that changing filters more often than their oil helps extend change intervals. Also there is more to consider when determining oil change intervals than just mileage. Engine type (does it have a turbo for example), environmental extremes etc. also need to be considered. And time is a consideration too because while the oil itself may not be \"worn out\" or the additive package in it may still be effective (particularly in Extended Performance versions which contain larger amounts) still there are contaminants that oil filters do not remove which are a result of the combustion process, over time these build up and can only be removed by changing your oil. This is also why if you use a vehicle seasonally such as storing your motorcycle over the winter it is best to change the oil when you put it away rather than at the start of the season.If you look on the bottles of oils with claims they can go for long periods of time between oil changes (15K plus) you will find some small print saying things such as \"Do not alter oil change intervals from manufacturer requirements on vehicles under warranty (as this will likely VOID your warranty not keeping the maintenance schedule)\" and \"25,000 miles OR ONE YEAR\" as well as many other various conditional statements about the vehicle operating conditions. What may be OK under ideal and perfect conditions is different from most all real situations.Some people engage in oil testing, sending their oil to labs to find out condition of the oil.  For me this seems perhaps reasonable if one it attempting to find out what length change interval they are able to obtain with a certain oil\/filter combination.  However as something done on a regular basis for the average consumer this costs as much as an oil change so I would just change the oil instead of finding out the condition the old oil is in.As to Royal Purple being a good synthetic oil? I would say yes it is. Also very expensive particularly with this deal. If it is either the best or worth the price is the larger questions to consider. Is it worth it at this price? I would say NO it was recently on sale for 6.99\/quart, at that time or the next time it goes on sale that is the prime time to purchase. Personally I prefer other brands, though my decisions are changing along with the changing of formulations of the oils I use. One should do research in to various synthetic motor oils and consider those as well and decide which one to use. Do not go by marketing claims. There are independent tests and discussions, there is even one with over 1000 posts on this subject on Amazon right now. Many other outside oil forums as well. One can also have their oil tested to compare results vs other brands used at various intervals in their own vehicle if one wants to do that sort of personal research which will yield at least some results.  Also formulations are constantly changing so what ingredients used in any particular oil one year may not be what the formulation is today or will be tomorrow. If you research oil and decide that it is worth paying a bit more for a true group IV oil, then that is a reasonable decision to pay a bit more for that oil. I believe this RP is among Group IV oils, meaning it uses 100% synthetic base stocks.  But contact Royal Purple to confirm this because their formulations change like all others. Make sure you know what you are buying.I would also encourage purchasing any oil when it is on a big sale or has a rebate etc.. I believe most synthetics are overpriced and should be purchased only when on sale as this does happen on a regular basis. Check Amazon and other auto supply stores. There are constantly sales on synthetic oils and\/or rebates making the cost per quart 6.00 or less on a regular basis, this is the time to purchase your oil.  Often there are packages with filters which can be good deals as long as the filter is the one you would like to use also.  This nor any other oil will perform well without also using a high quality filter, period. Make sure you are also using a high quality filter. The two need to both be of good quality for best performance and protection.I give this a 4 star rating due to price. It has been on sale for less recently and that is the time to purchase expensive oils. Plan ahead and buy your oil when on a really good sale. You can save about 50% or at least close to it often times especially when offered with packages including an oil filter (as long as it is a good filter). The star rating reflects the value of this deal at this price.In the end get a high quality oil but remember no oil is going to be providing its full benefits if it is no longer effective due to excessive use or age.  Keep your maintenance schedules up to get the best performance and longest life out of your vehicle.Royal Purple IS one in the group of top quality motor oils, just where it ranks is much more difficult to determine.  Disregard outrageous claims made by any manufacturer or person and do your own research in to various synthetic oils to make a decision on which to use.  There are several very good quality brands. Also learn about API, ILSAC and Dexos1 specifications mean. This Royal Purple DOES meet the most current API specification (SF) the ILSAC GF-5 and GM's new Dexos1 requirements. It should be compared against other synthetics that also meet those same specifications. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT RATINGS. These are your best street car motor oils. So YES this is a good oil, NO it will not do anything other high quality synthetic oils in the same class can do, and No this is not the best price I have seen for this oil.Instead of comparing claims on a bottle (other than those API, ILSAC and perhaps Dexos1 ratings) do some outside research. Ignore outrageous claims and make an informed decision based upon knowledge of the oil and filters you purchase and what an appropriate price to purchase them at is.EDIT: Note that at the time of the review Royal Purple was using PAO base stocks.  I have information that it is not not a 100% PAO oil. This has been a pattern among oils that were once 100% PAO group IV oils so you can not count on any brand maintaining their formulations or advising or a new formulation or change.  There are some advantages to a PAO oil such as no need for V.I. additives and if you believe in the value of P.A.O. base stock oils that could justify a slightly higher purchase price.  My belief in this change is a response to this question by a representative or Royal Purple.  This does not mean it is no longer a good oil to buy just that the formulation may no longer use P.A.O. base stocks.  One should know what they are paying for particularly if they are purchasing a product at a premium price especially if that product no longer uses the ingredients one things it does.","reviewerID":"A2WYCJOJY6QSJI","unixReviewTime":1317945600}

It money were not a consideration, I would probably give it 5 stars because it works well and the battery lasts a long time. However, the MSRP for this item is $100 and it is currently selling on Amazon for $50. This is absolutely too expensive for an item like this. The pricing makes no sense at all. There is no amazing feature of this device, the design isn't revolutionary or particularly ingenious. It is just plain expensive.I just don't get it. and neither should you, if you care about saving money. Especially with how inexpensive LED based lighting devices are these days. I can understand if you want a high quality under cabinet light for your garage, but you could just get inexpensive tap lights. The whole thing just doesn't make sense.","reviewerID":"A2YEZ8Z3BW2SKG","unixReviewTime":1342656000}

I cannot think of a single challenge in either of these fields where they've either not already had in their product mix a perfect solution or where their engineers didn't come up with one very quickly. This Clean Sand Kit easily lives up to their stellar reputation and I was very pleased when I used it to sand several large skim coat areas of our newly remodeled kitchen at how effectively it did the job and kept the vast majority of the resulting dust safely in my shop vacuum. I previously had a somewhat similar device from Hyde that I was less then happy with (both from the effectiveness of the abrasive medium and how well it captured the resulting dust). This 3M product is clearly superior IMHO and I can heartily recommend it.

This battery test is first done at the completion of the constant voltage charging stage, and then every 12 hours while in float stage.My experience is that this battery test will NOT detect a battery that has been charged and passed the battery test, but then fails to start the engine the next time, i.e. that fails to hold charge. I am guessing that a longer battery test(at least one hour) might catch batteries that charge up okay, but fail to hold charge. Other battery smart chargers (e.g. CTEK) also have very short test periods, so will probably not catch such batteries either.The other minor disadvantage is that the BatteryMINDer 2012 has a maximum current of only 2 amps, so charging a battery  that is significantly discharged will take some time.","reviewerID":"A2Z3LXLRFUG6R7","unixReviewTime":1361318400}

{"asin":"B000I66JEM","overall":5,"reviewText":"The Key Vault appears to be well made, with very little plastic.  Being concerned about rust (which may or may not be a problem), I put a little bit of Teflon oil on the inside of the two sliding retainers that hold the two pins in, as well as a drop on the two latch points before installing.  This way, if it does get some rust, it will have less of a chance of seizing up.  Long term instead of oil, I'd probably recommend a small amount of Teflon based grease where the pin contacts the two sliders, as well as on where the sliders contact the inner wall.  Since the drawer walls are high, the oil isn't going to come into contact with the contents.  I'd probably consider a drop of oil on the spring in the back that pushes the drawer out when the right combination is entered and the lever pulled.I easily changed the combination and had no problems whatsoever installing it.  Time will tell if it gets water into the drawer, but so far, it looks decently water resistant.  I personally am not worried about water getting in the drawer.As for people being able to tell it is there, the only real way someone can find it is if they examine the hitch pins and notice that it isn't a standard hitch lock, or pull off the dust cover.If someone had to place a spare key on a vehicle, this is the most secure solution for this answer.  Of course, a thief who has some power tools can get into it, as well as someone sitting there flipping through 10,000 combinations.If someone is worried that keeping a spare key in this would be a security issue, you can do the following which an acquaintance of mine does:  Keep a \"dummy\" key in the Hitch Safe that will open the door.  Then inside the vehicle, use a console or other strongbox with a stout lock store in there a spare key that works in the ignition.  This way, for a thief to steal the vehicle, they would have to either break out the Hitch Safe, then try drilling out a heavy steel enclosure for the ignition key, or break the windows and try to get into the console safe.  Either way, eventually a thief would prevail, but it will take a lot of time and noise.  For all but the most crime-plagued areas, the Hitch Safe appears good enough -- it keeps all but the dedicated thieves with hand\/power tools away.","reviewerID":"A2ZYXZ3UEDABLA","unixReviewTime":1288915200}

Some extremely chemically, others on the \"green\" side of things. Some work well, others not. Permatex's Grez-Off I am glad to report is both!On a scale of 1-10, here is how I would rank Grez-Off.Old grease 2 months and older: 4I have several old grease stains\/areas in the garage and on the driveway. I applied it full strength and let it sit several minutes to do it's magic. The really old stains, it barely touched. The stains that were fairly new, around 2 months old, it removed it fairly easily. With the aid of a pressure washer the older stains came up even more so vs. just the pressure washer.New grease: 9For spot treating and cleaning tools it worked AWESOMELY! Very little work involved and left the tools and spots really clean.The smell is not unpleasant or harsh, just kind of run of the miss degreaser smelling.The pump bottle works well. I don't know how many times I've had pump bottles break or stop working before I've even used 1\/3 of the bottle.Grez-Off has made such an impression I've added it to my arsenal of cleaning products.

I just bought a car, and I'm definitely going to apply it to the bra-area.My only drawback:  It doesn't go very far.  If you have more than a small bra area, you'll need two cans.I ended up applying two coats to my motorcycle, as I do custom Swarovski work atop the clear vinyl and I wanted to have the extra protection.

{"asin":"B0002SRL20","overall":4,"reviewText":"I originally boughtARB ARB605 Blue Inflator with Gauge and Braided Hosebut it had a leaking hose, so I returned it and got this.  A number of people say the gauge on this is too small.  I don't think the numbers on the gauge are much smaller than on the ARB Blue, but the Milton's gauge does feel harder to read.  I think it has more to do with the gauge being deeply inset behind thick glass\/oil so light doesn't penetrate quite as easily as on the ARB's gauge, and the fact its measurement line is silver metal instead of bright red like the needle in the ARB's gauge.  Using a silver metal line is just stupid because it's a low contrast against a white background and black text and the silver partly reflects white light depending on how light strikes it making it even harder to see.  I think whoever designed this gauge \"back in the day\" decided it was somehow perfect and never needed any tweaks despite user complaints and other companies coming up with some better ideas.The junction between the red hose and gold pipe rotates which is nice if you want to push the filler against the tire at a convenient angle and still read the gauge.  The ARB doesn't have that feature which can leave its gauge hard to read because on a lot of tires you can only clip the hose on at a certain angle.One of the reviewers said the gauge measured pressure as you filled the tire, but that isn't true.  The gauge goes to zero while you fill, just like every other tire filler I've ever used, and only measures when you're not filling.  The gauge itself measured an identical value to a hand-held gauge I've been using forever.The description says the Milton has a \"dual chuck\" which I thought maybe meant you could rotate the silver end to press either side to the tire and one side might be made to connect to a different style of air connection.  But the silver part does not rotate and the air connection on both sides is identical.  I got the impression from another review that having a connection on the other side is useful if you have to push the hose into a tight space and pull the chuck back onto an air connection.The ARB comes with a type D quick disconnect already screwed in but on the Milton you have to supply your own sealing tape and screw in your own quick disconnect (ieLegacy A73457D Color Connex Type D 7 Piece 1\/4 in. Red Coupler and Plug Kit).The ARB has a button you can use to release pressure from what you're inflating but the Milton has no such feature.  I don't think it's at all difficult to release some pressure on the chuck and just let air escape from the tire and that's probably easier than using a pressure-release button anyway.  Plus having a button creates another point that can fail during manufacture or after you've owned the tool for awhile.Despite the shortcomings, the Milton is much more solidly constructed than the ARB and the hose doesn't leak.","reviewerID":"A30UFXOF0GS9NM","unixReviewTime":1354060800}
{"asin":"B004HCOE8Q","overall":5,"reviewText":"This is a dynamite product, easy on-easy off, great results!I used it on a 14 year old Lexus with white metallic paint.  Although the car has been well cared for, it had amassed its share of swirls, light scratches and bonded contaminants.  I thought for sure I was going to have to clay it first, but as that's a step I am not fond of, I thought I would take a chance and try the polish alone,  I'm sure glad I did.I applied the polish by hand. Afterward, the car felt absolutely smooth to the touch, and many of the previously mentioned defects were either gone or faded into the background. The paint was shiny, with depth and brilliance restored.After carefully wiping off all the excess polish, I gave the paint a \"quick detail\" with a detailing spray to make sure all the dust was removed before waxing. I followed this with one coat of Carnauba Wax.  The result was outstanding.  I have never seen white paint give off such clarity, depth, gloss and reflectivity.  The surface of the car is now smooth to the touch and the envy of many of the mechanics over at the Lexus dealership when I went in to buy some parts yesterday.I think that the Ultimate Polish is a great product, at a very fair price.  I highly recommend it.Ps.  I did use a more slightly more aggressive pad to apply the polish.  It's called a Polishing pad  (as opposed to a finishing pad) Used with a hand held pad holder called a Polishing Pal (available on Amazon).  All work was done by hand, following Meguiar's instructions for multiple passes over each section.","reviewerID":"A30UIX94KZY50P","unixReviewTime":1369267200}

I had the grill off to install my head light covers, so it was a great time to clip these to the grill.  First one went on like a breeze.  As I opened the individual bag for the second one, a little piece of plastic fell out of the bag.  It was one of the small tabs that hold it in place.I installed it anyway, thinking one tab missing on one cover isn't so bad.  But as I opened the next three covers, they each had broken tabs.  That made four out of five bad.  Suddenly I started thinking about them rattling after a couple months on the road, so I took them all off, repacked them, and sent them back.  The return process is a breeze by the way.I debated about getting replacements, or just a refund.  In the end, I like the look, so I asked for replacements.  Hopefully I will get them as quick as the original order, and I hope they are all in good condition.  Follow-up review to come.UPDATE!!I recieved the replacement product quickly and before I even tried to install the insert, I took each piece out and inspected it closely.

I will very quickly gloss over the fact that the packaging informs us that the company is indeed women owned and cleverly promotes \"Wipe Out Breast Cancer - Change your blades... change a life!\"  Considering all the advertising these days with no positive effect whatsoever; these were a welcome change.Directly from their website\/packaging:Wipe Out Breast CancerEvery three minutes a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Because of these startling statistics, AutoTex PINK is doing its part by giving 10 percent of its proceeds to support the National Breast Cancer Foundation.Many have stated they were weren't really positive what sort of proceeds were being donated; for anyone still wondering it is 10%.Now onto the actual product!  I offered to help my husband change the wiper blades for the new \"PINK\" ones so that I could see the difficulty level.  The directions were printed on a tiny sheet and showed all the parts that were in the packaging.  We were set off track for about 3.5 minutes (lol) because we were trying to figure out what to do with the extra little parts.  My husband then realized that they were \"ready\" out of the box to be installed, where he proceeded to just snap them into place.  VOILA! done.  I was still reading the directions holding the little black pieces... beginners learning curve (and I am sticking to that).  Hubby decided that he loves the way these rubber wipers hug the windshield and cleanly wipe the window.  There is no sound and they stay nicely in place at windy\/high speeds thanks to the frameless design .  We were not able to test the no snow\/ice build up claims, but we will update later in the Winter.  If they do not hold true to the snow\/ice claims we will still be \"repeat\" buyers of this frameless design just because of the difference in performance.The bad:  If cleanly wipes without leaving any streaking, but he has found that when water accumulates on the top of the driver's side wiper it can at times splash it over to the passenger's side.  Not a biggie at all though.Highly recommend for all to try the High Performance Frameless design; even better knowing that 10 percent will go to a wonderful cause to help so many women that have suffered\/will suffer through this disease.FYI: You need to order two for your vehicle (one in each box)!

Make sure that your transmission uses this weight, or you may run into some issues.  Also, find out if your transmission takes GL4, or the newer GL5 fluids.

Anyone with a black car should give this wax a shot and I will make a bet that you too will see the difference.  Even my coworkers saw the difference right away.  Just by switching to this wax.  They commented that it was \"brighter and really glossy\".This wax does provide a very nice, reflective shine.  Very easy to apply and wipe off. You won't be disappointed with this wax.  Other waxes (especially those synthetic polymers wax) Such as NXT requires that you wait at least  20 minutes for the wax to dry before you buff it out.  Even then, they still show signs of \"smears or streaks or oily residue\" on dark colored cars.  This carnuba wax dries in no time.  By the time you apply the last coat, you can start buffing out the first panel you apply the wax on.The shine is just simply amazing.

Generally I have been happy with my purchase but the large number of small parts is a concern. Extech provides tiny dust caps for many of the conductive surfaces, which should improve their longevity. While these are a nice touch, they are likely to get lost.  Additionally, the base cables are separate from the probes and clips, creating 12 separate parts.  Adding the slim reach test probes, which would be purchased separately, there will be a total of 14 items in the case.It would take a longer time period to truly evaluate this product as the corrosion resistance of the surfaces along with the durability of the PVC cables will be the key indicators of value. Meanwhile, the cables and probes appear to be well made.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the flared design of the main probes can be less than ideal in tight spaces.  So, you might want to consider purchasing the Extech TL743 Slim Reach Test Probe Set at the same time.  Note the term \"set\" in the case of the slim reach test probe set is a bit misleading because there are only two probes without case or cables.  They will fit nicely in the existing case.The Extech TL809 Electronic Test Lead Kit is a solid value.  There is some room for improvement, such as integrated caps, but this would most likely come with an increase in expense and some additional limitations.  For no additional expense, Extech should include the slim leads in the base kit and make the flared probes optional.  At this price point, this lead set is highly recommended.ProsNice carrying caseComes with probes, alligator clips and plunger mini-hooksDust caps on conductor surfacesConsToo many small partsFlared test probes too wide for some applications","reviewerID":"A33ZYFE8XMKKR1","unixReviewTime":1321488000}

{"asin":"B00AZBINXA","overall":4,"reviewText":"If you have carpets in your home, then you likely need to deep clean them more often than you think.  Simple vacuuming gets up dust, but plenty gets in there (even if you don't wear shoes indoors), so owners of homes with carpets will need to rent carpet deep cleaners sometimes.  Of course, renting doesn't help for the house with kids where stained carpets happen all too often (or with pets), so owning a machine such as this one can be invaluable.I was impressed with the power of this machine for price.  The commercial machines you rent are considerably bigger and heavier, but this one seems to accomplish much of that power in a much smaller package.  When you get the Deep Clean Premier, you will need to assemble it.  This is a simple matter of inserting the handle, hose rack, and attaching 3 screws.  The cleaner comes with a bottle of cleaner (enough for about 1.5 fillings).  The cool thing is that the clean water tank is a bladder inside the waste water tank.  As the clean detergent is sprayed out, the bladder shrinks and the waste water takes the volume on the other side of the bladder.  I was skeptical, but it worked quite well.I definitely recommend you pre-vacuum.  This is a powerful machine, but I found that clumps of carpet were getting left behind by the vacuum.  I suspect this was dust that was too thick for the vacuum to get.  The beaters are quite aggressive so I wouldn't recommend you use this on a valuable or fragile rug.  There is no height adjustment on them (or speed\/sensitivity adjustment), so if you have a nice rug, this might not be the best choice.Overall, I was impressed by the simplicity of the tool and the strength of the suction.  I was also disgusted by the color of the water, which I suppose is a sign it pulled out some nasty stuff from the carpet.  I do wish there were height adjusters on the beaters and perhaps a flow control, but overall it's a good package which will help keep your home clean.  4 stars.","reviewerID":"A34CSXOGVYF94S","unixReviewTime":1372723200}

So far I am impressed enough to buy some more when needed as I am forced to frequently repack my bearings due to salt water spilling onto the roadway from the marsh that I drive through during high tides. Brackish water is brutal on bearings especially if you can't rinse it off. My tub of grease arrived in an old style cardboard can with a tin bottom & a pop off lid that is different from the advertised picture. The one in the picture appears to be a plastic tub with screw on lid that would be nice for storage and probably allot less prone to leak. This isn't a problem for me since I usually go through a whole tub on a bearing repack but I would prefer sellers use accurate photos when advertising products or at the very least state the fact that products may differ from the advertised picture in the product details. I was surprised at how well this product shipped. It arrived in pristine condition with absolutely no leakage.

The product is very slippery, it smells great, and I think the cleaning power is very effective.  You can even use it full strength to remove stubborn dirt. I like the fact that it is a little thicker than most car washes and I think this is why it produces such rich suds. This car wash is tough on dirt but it won't strip wax.16 oz for eight bucks is a little too much for a car wash considering you can get 64 oz from Mothers for a few more bucks.  I also think that the Mothers is the better product simply because it does everything this product does for less money.I personally switched over to Mothers California Gold and I haven't looked back.  It does everything a car wash should do and at a great price. These day's you have so many different car washes on the market and most of them are pretty good.  Meguiars Gold Class is also an excellent choice.  I really don't think one car wash can perform any better than another as far as cleaning goes; they will all get your car clean.

I also learned a few things when I used this product.I started out by shaking the bottle well (as per the instructions) and then spraying all over the driver side of the dashboard, steering wheel and the control panel - basically I sprayed on surfaces as far as my hand could reach from the driver side. The point is that I thought I'd spray as much as I could at first, and then wipe away. Bad idea! And don't do it if it's your first time. Because it turned out that the somewhat milky liquid dries up fairly quickly. And it starts to leave behind a residue if you don't wipe it quickly enough. I ended up spraying over the same surfaces again, this time only a little and then wiping quickly. Then it worked well. Once I learned that lesson, everything was fine.The shine that this detailer left behind was very noticeable on my tan interior of the Civic. Not so much on the dark grey interior of the Accord. But still, in both cars, it ended up cleaning all surfaces very well. And as others mentioned, the smell is very nice!One more tip. Try not to spray on the windows - or if you do, make sure you wipe it off quickly, while you can still see it. Because if you don't, that same residue that I spoke of earlier may affect your sight later on. For me I didn't notice I had some of this liquid on the passenger side window, and only while driving I noticed that there was some of this liquid blocking my clear vision of the side mirror. Little dangerous. So be careful and wipe away all the liquid that you spray quickly.","reviewerID":"A36PFPY4O3E1DV","unixReviewTime":1402358400}

As far as i know East Coast Gear Supply that sells off roads and competition racing diffs and gears use lucas oils and that is why i bought it for my Tacoma. Wonderful oil. I will be purchasing this again when i drive it to another 30k6\/26\/2013I bought another gallon and a half for my 1989 Land Cruiser's two diffs and transfer case. When i drove around to heat up my diffs and transfer case the suv felt kind of sluggish. After i did the diff oil change and drove it around again my SUV felt much more responsive on acceleration, no chirping or odd noises. I got this land cruiser at 175k miles and when chaning the diff oil there was alot of metal shavings so yes in this case changing the diff oil made a HUGE difference. Maybe the responsiveness was not due to the lucas oil but my SUV is accepting it very well.As for my tacoma the diff is quiet and sounds like it doing very well.","reviewerID":"A37CNJCLFYNQD1","unixReviewTime":1357257600}

I've been using them on my truck since I got it in 2008 and I think the paint looks as good as it does today because of that despite the harsh Texas summers which last about 6 months around here.To use the refresher you need to leave your vehicle running, with the AC on, for 15 minutes. That's not a big deal but you do need to be where your car is secure and\/or under close observation.The new car scent is not bad but not fantastic either (to me). It is strong the first day or two after application then it is just a very pleasant clean smell. I used mine about 40 days ago and it still smells fresh when I open the door after it has been sitting. I smoke in my truck so that is impressive. I use a water bottle that I can reseal with a little water in it for the butts to keep the old ashtray smell at bay.The instructions mention a locking mechanism. That is just the little nib that catches when you fully depress the trigger.This is going to be something I buy periodically.","reviewerID":"A37DXIENIDHTVY","unixReviewTime":1405900800}

At first the separator functioned great for about a year. Kept all of the moisture out of my air tools!However, a year later the separator formed a crack in the acrylic housing and began leaking so much air out that it caused my compressor to turn on every 5 minutes! I understand why they used acrylic so the person could tell if it was full of water and needed to be drained.The point is however, acrylic, no matter how thick, is not designed to hold pressure above 50 PSI (Pressure Per Square Inch). And since most air tools require 90 PSI or more, the separator will not stand up to that pressure for very long.I think it would make a better solution to make the separator out of metal, since it can hold up to great pressures more, and the person just needs to remember to drain their separator same time they drain their compressor.In conclusion, I like these things when they work, however I don't recommend this product and I highly recommend the buyer to spend more money on a metal unit.

{"asin":"B00B7GC50Y","overall":5,"reviewText":"I'm using the NOCO 5W solar panel in a bit of an unusual way to provide inexpensive power to my garden shed. Inside the shed, rather than running a line from my home, I have a pair of 12V marine batteries and a 1500W inverter, giving me a cheap but limited power source for lighting and so forth.I mounted the NOCO panel to the roof of my shed using an epoxy-based adhesive, and then ran the cable to my battery. The outdoor parts seem high quality and well sealed against dirt or moisture, so I'm hopeful they will last a long time. The cables aren't quite as high quality, but I was able to wrap them in plastic to ensure they hold up well. The cables attach to a vented battery box, and everything seems to work as advertised.I've also ordered a second one of these I intend to mount on my sailboat to keep at least one of the batteries charged all the time. A boat in a marina is probably the ideal location since it would be far from any shade, and so I expect the NOCO to work well for me there.Where I live (Long Island - NY), in full sunshine, I'm getting 5.2 watts of power at 12VDC, which is adequate to trickle-charge my batteries. Only issue I've seen is that in less than full sunlight, the power drops off quickly, so it's often down around 1-2W if there are clouds in the sky.As others point out, 5W is a very small amount of power...in my area, residential electricity costs about $0.10 per KWH, so assuming you had 365 days a year of perfect sunshine for 8 hours a day, the 5W this unit puts out is $1.46 a year worth of electricity.Otherwise, so far, the NOCO is holding up well and I'd have no trouble recommending it for low-energy uses - especially considering the bargain price.","reviewerID":"A38KK0SZYEH5UD","unixReviewTime":1364688000}

Now that's fantastic.  No more mowing.  Tried telling that to the yard but laughter pursued with vigor.  Amazon was kind enough to send the Schumacher 1000A and in a few days I was ready to try again.  After reading the manual and seeing how compact and well made the charger is I hooked it up and in a short time it was grass cutting time again.My initial reaction was that the size was considerably smaller than I expected compared to the picture on Amazon.  The box it fits in sits well on a handy shelf and is ready for its next use.  The plastic covering at first left me wondering why did they not use metal and it dawned on me that the metal could be a problem if the hot clips came in contact with it.  Heavy duty plastic is far better for me.  After setting the parameters which were simple to do I attached the clips to my battery and it started charging.  Expecting the charge to take over an hour I waited and in less than an hour it was ready.  With a turn of the key the mower started as if it were new and I can only thank Schumacher.  And I do.  Now the key is the next time and the next time.  Will it be the powerhouse I originally purchased and will it work with other batteries such as the truck's?

{"asin":"B00029WRJQ","overall":5,"reviewText":"I highly recommend these mirrors. I did a lot of looking and comparing before I bought these. I have a 2006 Toyota Tacoma and these things fit well and do a real nice job. They vibrate a little but not excessive. The little bit of vibration I see doesn't interfere with my view. I also do not extend them very far. The further out you go with them the more they will vibrate. Just extend to the minimum needed in order to be able to see.Before attaching to the vehicle I think it's a good idea to loosen the three screws holding the swivel in place on the bottom of the mirrors and work in a drop of oil. Then do not over tighten these screws. They don't have to be very tight to hold the mirror still and not over tightening allows easy adjustment later. If you find they move when you close the door you can tighten a little more but to start off, finger tight with the screwdriver is all you need. I also placed a couple drops of oil on the aluminum sliding bar and worked it in before attaching. Also, when you bolt the mirror onto the aluminum slide bar, grip the base (the part with the internal threads) with a vise-grip or something (not too tight to crush it), then make sure the lock nut is between the bolt and the bar on the bottom, and then screw the bolt into the base (and through the aluminum slide bar) nice and tight without letting the base turn. You'll notice there are &#34;teeth&#34; on the bottom of the base. These are supposed to sink into the bar as you tighten the bolt. They keep the base from turning when you adjust the mirror. This is another good reason to not overtighten the three screws around the swivel. You want to be able to adjust the mirror from side to side and have it turn only at the swivel and without causing the base to turn against the aluminum slide bar.The bracket will bend the weather stripping on the outside of the window a little. It springs back when the mirror is removed but some of it will be permanent. It's not a big deal and you'll just have to deal with this if you want to use these mirrors. It is not a detriment to the operation of the window.I installed them as far forward as possible so that the top of the bracket was parallel to the ground and the new mirror sits right beside my existing one towards the outside. Tightening the ratchet by hand produced plenty of tension to hold it securely. Releasing the ratchet is another matter. It's too tight to just push it down with your finger. To release the tension I use a short piece of rope and loop it under the sliding buckle. Then I stand right next to the truck with the rope looped around one hand and my other hand on the ratchet release tab. I use my body leverage (knees and back) to pull upward on the rope a little which takes just enough pressure off the belt to allow me to press the ratchet release tab. You don't need to back the ratchet off very far - just enough to get the hook out from under the door. Then just close up the bracket and wrap up the belt around it and you're all pre-set for the next time.For better stability I advise when you're adjusting the belt, place the sliding buckle as necessary so that the crossbar forming the angle is not extended very far, if at all. And, yes, make sure there isn't any dirt behind the buckle or you'll get a scuff mark.You should have the windows all the way down when attaching to the vehicle. The bracket comes close to the window so you need to be careful not to let it scratch the window. After you get the mirror on I advise to raise the window very slowly to make sure that the metal bracket is not contacting (scratching) the window as you raise it. Once you're under way - be sure not to lower the window if there is any sand or debris laying on the bracket right next to the window or a scratch may occur from this action also. I've taken these off and on several times now and we've travelled with them and I've been relatively careful and have never had one scratch my window.On my truck, the doors fit really well and I can tell the difference when the hook for the mirror strap is hooked under the door. The door fits just a tad more tightly than usual. It has to be closed just a slight bit harder to make the latch engage and when I open the door it pops out ever so slightly because of the extra tension produced by the hook being in there on the bottom. I don't see this as a problem. The mirrors are not on there all the time and, even if they were, I think the latch mechanism on the Toyota is stout enough to handle it without any long term problems developing. Just be aware that the hook will slightly change thge way the door latches.The instructions are good, too. Not the usual loosely translated Mandarin. I've tried to supplement here with my own experience.","reviewerID":"A39AD95B47OEYX","unixReviewTime":1403395200}

It is everything to get you started if you have nothing...Pros:  The hose comes with end caps to keep drips from wandering after dumping.  The hose compresses and stays that way until you need to expand it.  The hose support also expands to match the length that the hose is expanded for a given campsite.  Plus, it&#8217;s compact, light weight and has a carrying handle.  The gloves come in a box that has self-adhesive strips for mounting it to a convenient spot in the RV.  The rinse cap has an integrated ball valve to turn the water on\/off.  It doubles as an end cap if needed.  It is easier than trying to rinse the hose out with just a garden hose because you can hold one end of the dump hose up to allow rinse water to fill the dump hose.Cons:  Gloves are nothing special.  I prefer better fitting latex or vinyl gloves used for painting.  I probably won&#8217;t use the rinse cap a lot because I dump black water first, then grey (soapy) water second.  It would be nice to have a clear fitting instead of a white one to tell when the tank has finished dumping, but you can usually tell by sound.  The hose does not look as durable as the Valterra hose that I currently have.  I&#8217;m not sure how it will handle multiple cycles of expanding\/contracting or dragging across concrete.  There are heavier duty hoses available for about $15 more.  The Valterra hose is made from a spiral metal wire, wrapped in vinyl.  The Camco hose does not appear to have any metal in it.I didn&#8217;t try out the tank drop-ins yet, but I will in the next month.Overall, this is a great kit at a fair price ($60) that will get you started with your RV.","reviewerID":"A39E7IWNHY62JT","unixReviewTime":1385078400}

{"asin":"B0002NYDZ8","overall":5,"reviewText":"I have a possible solution for the tight-coupler problem. I used to have a Caterpillar grease gun that had to be pried off the fitting just like this gun does. It was also a heavy duty, industrial gun like this Lincoln. I like heavy duty, but there is a limit to how much force needs to be applied to free the coupler from the grease fitting. Most do-it-yourselfers have a Dremel. Dremel makes a small, cone-shaped, red-stone bit. It's head is 5mm wide at the base and 8.5 long. I don't know the item number. It is tiny. Under a magnified florescent work lamp, I lightly ground the three crescent-shaped, spring-loaded clamps that grab the grease fitting, careful to maintain the original contour. This took about two minutes. I'd lightly graze all three clamps and then test the connection. I left the coupler a little tight allowing for future wear. This grease gun is top quality. After a two-minute modification, it is now a customized tool. Guys like to customized cars, motorcycles and guns, why not their tools? I needed a tough pistol-grip grease gun to access tight places where it is nearly impossible to operate a lever-action gun.  This works for me.  Good luck.","reviewerID":"A39F7XOVXQ0LZK","unixReviewTime":1218844800}

{"asin":"B0002SR7TC","overall":4,"reviewText":"This thing is well worth it overall.  It's not going to work for every vehicle, however.  My Corolla and my Yukon are both apparently not compatible with the down-the-tube method of oil removal.  For my Crown Vic, and my pre-80's cars, it's simply outstanding.It pulls an amazing amount of oil from the pan, just have to fish around a little with the hose after you get most of the oil out, in order to find any small pockets of oil remaining.  After about 3-4 minutes of suction, I removed the drain plug and checked.  I only got a tablespoon or so of drip, which is pretty good, overall.  Transmission oil is just as easy, but I think you'd be better off slightly elevating the front\/rear\/side in order to force fluid toward the dipstick because the pans are usually flatter\/shallower.Quick, easy, and you can just pump it right back into the empty oil container.  You're still going to get some on you...Finally, my one complaint, there is no way to securely fasten the hose and adapter fittings to the pump when it's not in use.  Minor, but irritating, since the little friction clip is pretty much useless if you bump the hose out.  The fittings disappeared into the garage somewhere, since I set them aside while I pumped out the oil.  Would be much better to have a little plastic compartment on the side\/base of the pump to drop those into.  Had to adapt a fuel line to use as an adapter.Would definitely buy again, and recommend to friends.  Love it.","reviewerID":"A39VLN90M0D8XL","unixReviewTime":1376524800}

You really have to keep your eyes focused in the area of the HD Vision to really get the impact.Another issue is surface area of the HD Vision. Don't get me wrong, the daylight visor and the night are good at reducing glare and could remove your need for sunglasses, except... you still have to look around yourself. This means when you look out of your window, look in your rear view mirror or elsewhere, you lose the effect. This means the usefulness is only for facing forwards. The only way to fix this would be to offer say, an adhesive film for the side windows and rear window.It's a nice idea. It's a flawed execution.

I ended up mounting it with velcro between the driver seat and center console, then ran two of the LEDs under the center console to the passenger side and the other two to the driver side.Instead of messing with any power wires, I bought the \"Roadpro 12V Fused Replacement Cigarette Lighter Plug with Leads\" and used that to power the lights. Working fine so far.As for the lights themselves, here are some pros and cons:Pros:-Nice and bright-Easy to stick some velcro on ends of tubes and stick them on bare metal under the dash and under front seats.-Wires are plenty long-Lots of lighting pattern choices, nearly all of them look great-Love the rainbow-colored fading pattern - matches up perfectly with my aftermarket deck-Wheel on the side of the control box controls how fast or slow the lights fade - a nice touchCons-While having a lot of choices in lighting patterns is good, it can also be a hassle because...-This doesn't come with a remote, which would be much easier to cycle through patterns.-Has turned on by itself a couple times during the day when I don't want it to. I assume this is because I power it through the center console cigarette lighter which is always on. You could easily wire it to a power source that turns on only when the ignition is on (the directions tell you how to do that)Overall, I'm pretty satisfied after a couple days of having these installed. Wish it came with a remote, but I could've paid a few more dollars for the 6pc. Million Color LEDs by LEDGlow that DOES come with a remote.I definitely recommend this product.

Sometimes the sky opens up and rain falls in sheets, like driving through a car wash. Down here we need really good windshield wipers. But it's not always clean, we live in the mud and swamp and that splashes up on the car and the windshield, and then of course bugs commit caricide and birds crap and the windshield takes it all while we try to see out of it and not get killed by our fellow New Orleans drivers.The Bosch blades were easy to install. We drive a 2011 scion xb and needed the 22B and the 20B. Ordering is easy, Put Bosch icon wiper blades in the amazon search and just pick anyone, then a screen will come up on the page telling you to make sure this is the right size blade. The page has a menu and you click the make, model, and year of your car and it will tell you exactly what you need and you can go to the right page for the size of wipers for your vehicle.After Jim installed the wipers we had a huge rainstorm and they kept the windshield clear while he drove to work. We also had one of those on and off sprinkles where we had to use the intermittent wiper setting and the icons did a good job of not stuttering and skipping over the windshield. They also did a good job when we sprayed the wiper fluid up and used the wipers to get dirt and gunk off. They didn't get the dried bird poop off but we haven't a wiper yet that does completely.I will update about how long they lasted, we do not garage our cars and so the blades are exposed to rain, sun, humidity, and heat- the usual New Orleans climate.","reviewerID":"A3AZI828WJN1CD","unixReviewTime":1328486400}

{"asin":"B008XB9BJY","overall":5,"reviewText":"I am finishing the process of increasing our RV boondocking battery time by changing over all of our light bulbs to LEDs. Hopefully this will result in a dramatic decrease in draw on the batteries and reduce amount of generator usage thus saving fuel.Almost all of our RV lighting is the very standard Gustafson Lighting pancake lights, some in a single and some in dual dome configurations. I needed a total of 23 bulbs to complete the changeover of these lights. Both my wife and I really like the \"warm feel\" and look of tungsten bulbs so we wanted warm white lighting that would be very close to what was existing, something that feels like home and not a hospital or garage. To achieve a bright LED with something close to 3000K seems to be rare to find and generally much more expensive than something in white or cool white color temperatures(3500K-6000K).Jump to the results: This light is fantastic! It is very bright without being harsh, it is a nice warm white color temperature and is a perfect replacement for tungsten bulbs. It fits the pancake lights without any problem so there is no worry about length or diameter. In order to achieve a combination of good lighting and energy savings we did a mix of these bulbs and the Brightech 66 LED bulbs ([...]) based on location. In our kitchen area we used the 66 LED lights for all fixtures. For the living room area, bedroom and bathrooms we installed mostly these 36 LED bulbs however on a few of the dual dome configurations we used the 36 LED on one side and 66 LED on the other so we have the option of more light if needed but we can just run the lower wattage bulbs for general usage.The difference in wattage \/ amp draw is very dramatic. To calculate your savings over a standard 1141 tungsten bulb here are some figures. A tungsten 1141 uses 18.4 watts and puts out 259 lumens. The 66 LED bulbs from Brightech use 5 watts with 300 lumens, the 36 LED bulbs from Brightech use 1.8 watts with 200 lumens. This means I can use 10 Brightech 36 LED bulbs or 4 66 LED bulbs for the same power draw as one tungsten.These are an excellent value that have a nice look and just as important will save me gas. I highly recommend.","reviewerID":"A3CKI6VEH0HBMJ","unixReviewTime":1382918400}

{"asin":"B00AX4TWAM","overall":4,"reviewText":"I'm pretty cheap and wouldn't normally spend $40 on car wax, but I think this might be worth it.  Previously I've used cheaper products like Turtle Wax or Nu Finish but the humidity is pretty low here and it always dried quickly and was a lot of work to remove - not to mention the messy dust left behind that required another wash to get rid of it.  But the Griot's Carnauba wax went on easily (and it smells *really* good) and was easy to wipe off.  In fact, it was so much easier that I not only waxed my new Civic but also my wife's Odyssey (and a minivan is a LOT more work than a small car).  And it's especially nice that you don't have to worry so much about getting the wax on the plastic or rubber trim since it doesn't leave a mark like other waxes.As for the finish, there was a small but noticeable difference on my brand new car, but there was a huge difference on my wife's van which she takes to a local car wash on a regular basis.  The water truly \"beads up\" more on the sections with the carnauba wax compared to whatever was previously used.  I don't think I can go back to using anything else now, but fortunately it looks like this tin will last a while.  (Also, one of the pictures shows a cloth and applicator pad but my order came with just the tin of wax and nothing else.)UPDATE 7\/24\/13: There is perhaps one drawback to the \"superior beading action\" with this wax - it leaves spots.  We don't get a lot of rain here in SoCal but a rainstorm the other night left a beautiful coating of beaded water all over my car in the morning.  Since I hadn't washed it in a week there was a light coating of dirt which soon gave my car a leopard-spotted appearance, even after a short drive on the freeway.  I'd noticed this a couple times earlier when the sprinklers had left water on one side of the car.  The water beads up so effectively that it doesn't \"sheet\" off very well.  I guess it's not a problem as long as I can keep it washed, but it's not as perfect in a real-world setting as I previously imagined.","reviewerID":"A3CWEK9HY2VPDL","unixReviewTime":1371427200}

There was no squeak or stutter, and they were able to keep up with a full-on heavy rain, which some wipers do not seem to be able to do.

The compressor hose detaches off the body of the compressor via a quick connect you push together and pull out to disconnect.  The one I received was defective.  I pushed it in one time, then pulled it out.  When I tried to connect it again, the danged thing wouldn't connect in with a snap.  This is unreliable.  How would you like to be stranded with a flat and think, \"ok, I just got to air up the spare and be on my way,\" only to find out you can't connect the stupid hose to the compressor.  Hoses that are permanently connected are better.  I've had cheaper models I've kept in my car and used for 20 years and there's never been a problem of the hose that was permanently connected, failing.  This detachalbe hose on the SLIME is worthless.2.  I also completely disagree with other reviewers about the screw on connection to the tire valve.  I prefer the snap down clamp type.  It's so much easier to just snap the valve on rather than screw it on to the tire valve.  Plus, your tire valve is dirty, so after you spend a few seconds screwing it on, most likely, you hands will be black.  I've had plastic snap down clamps on my other compressors and there's never been any failure or breakage of the plastic.3.  An the frickin bag that comes with it is too danged small.

But then another electric came and said that it is digital sensor so it doesn't matter where to put it, finally they put it where it was easier for them :) even though I was asking them to put it in a middle as first one recommended in the beginning.And don't worry about parking your car on the hill - it will remember it is position once it is armed and won't trigger alarm, may be old gyroscope based ones were making triggering the alarm.We tested it then, lifted car from the other side and you had to lift your car about 3&#34; before alarm got triggered by this tilt sensor.

I was tempted to drink it :)Anyway, I used this to clay my car and aside from smelling so dang good, it also seemed to work well. There were only a few occasions in which the clay really dug in but that may have been because I wasn't keeping enough of the lube on the car. It was simple to use, just thoroughly spray the area you are working on (keep it limited to 2 feet by 2 feet at a time for best results IMO) and then continue to spray the lube as you work to keep the surface well coated.As an FYI, I would wear gloves, like Nitrile for example, because this stuff will turn your hands blue and you'll look like Violet from Willy Wonka's in no time! Also, if you get any on your trim, I wouldn't wait too long to wash it off once you're done with that section. I made the mistake of doing the entire car before finally washing the car and it bleached out some of the trim on my car. I wasn't happy but I spent about 8 hours claying my car, so it was on there for a very long time.Otherwise, very happy with this product","reviewerID":"A3DV41BS0CMIW6","unixReviewTime":1399680000}

On my 2006 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel the tail gate has a cable installed on both sides to hold the tail gate in the level position when down.  The install instructions tell you reinstall this cable on the same side as the tailgate assist after you replace the required parts.  There is a rubber grommet that goes on this cable to keep in in a safe position when you close the tailgate.  I found that this rubber grommet did not work well and once when I closed my tailgate the cable got caught between the tailgate and my tail light and cracked the tail light.  What I did was remove this cable and relied on just the other cable on the right side and the Tailgate Assist on the left side to hold the tailgate in the open position.

These blades are better than most that I've tried - definitely better than the similar ones by Valeo.With these blades I haven't had any problems with streaking, missing or skipping parts of the windshield, etc.  They stay tight against the windshield at highways speeds, and they're very quiet as well.  They were simple to install - easier than most others that I've used.Overall, an excellent wiper.  I've had problems with some other brands leaving streaks, especially on the driver's side of my Camry.  These haven't had that problem, so I'm very pleased.These blades are black, and the only \"pink\" thing is a small pink ribbon logo on the bracket of the wiper.

{"asin":"B005JU5VUK","overall":2,"reviewText":"The Bosch Icon wiper blade is Bosch's top of the line frameless wiper. This is an outstanding blade that is surprisingly easy to install.November 21, 2012 Update - Well these blades are not worth the extra premium price. They lasted just barely 9 months on my car. Normal life is a year (these are on a 2002 Buick Rendezvous - I've gone through roughly 9 sets of wipers). As I said in the lower part of this review, yes it was complicated to remember how to pull these blades off. They are different from all other blades around and those two little squeeze spots were hard to figure out after all this time. I won't be repurchasing these blades.The most important step with wiper blades, is finding the correct blade for your care. Gone are the days when I could go to a parts counter and ask for a 24 inch refill (refills don't exist anymore). There is a part finder on Amazon. I would also recommend using the blade finder at Bosch to simply double check the blades required. A lot of cars have two blades that are a different length. Oddly, my Buick Rendezvous did not have the third rear wiper listed, the part finders both places only listed two blades. There are also A and B versions of these blades, so be certain to pick the correct blade.The hardest part of installation is removing the old wiper blade. While visiting Bosch's blade finder, I stumbled on an excellent video that demonstrates how to replace wiper blades. Removing the old one is the longest part of the video. This particular blade is for the U shaped end of the metal wiper arm. There is usually a clip on the inside of that U on the pivot side of the wiper arm. It is also a good idea to lay a towel down on the windshield just in case the wiper arm jumps out of your hand - it's not unheard of to crack a windshield that way.The final step is to open the black plastic clip. Slide the U shaped end of the wiper arm through that clip and into the holder. Pull back and snap the clip down. The end of the wiper arm is now encased in lovely plastic. That's it, there's nothing more to do. Pretty simple.Replacing both wiper blades on my Buick Rendezvous at midnight, took me 20 minutes total, and that included washing my hands and recycling the packaging materials. I'll admit that I've changed a lot of wiper blades.The Icon blade is a direct competitor to the Goodyear Assurance wiper blade. It's pretty amazing to see these two blades side by side. The only real difference between the blades, the Bosch has an aerodynamic spoiler to help force the blade against the car window at speed. And the clip mechanism on the Goodyear is more universal, but leaves the clip exposed to the elements. Honestly, these two differences are nice looking, but I'm not sure they really make that much difference in the big picture.I installed the Goodyear Assurance blades about a year ago and couldn't exactly remember the clipping mechanism. So it took me a moment to remove the old blade. In a year or two when I replace these blades, I'm certain I will forget about how that plastic cover is clipped on, and will struggle just as much with the Bosch blades. In their marketing information Bosch talks about how the clip prevents snow and ice build up on the wiper blade. In all my years of driving in really bad snow storms, I've never seen a wiper blade have a problem with the cover to the attaching point.This is a good looking blade. Bosch and Goodyear both have eliminated that external frame with all the pivot points and metal or plastic holders - those really did get snow under them and create problems. They are now using a spring steel plate wrapped with plastic. There are no moving parts with this system. The rubber wiper blade is actually exactly the same as an external frame wiper - it sits inside a slot like all the rest. The end caps are attached tightly and should never fall off.Overall, this is an excellent wiper blade. Given that a wiper blade lasts for a good year or two, I think these are worth the extra cost over Bosch blades. I would shop based on price versus the Goodyear Assurance blades - they are virtually the same thing.Goodyear GY-WB765-24 Assurance Black 24'' Premium Rubber Graphite Coated Wiper Blade","reviewerID":"A3EXWV8FNSSFL6","unixReviewTime":1327449600}

Since this brush extends, it worked very well removing the wet snow from the roof of the SUV. The brush is stiff enough to push the snow very easily. That the head turns also allowed me to change from pushing the snow to sweeping the snow. This is a well-thought-out product that makes sense. The fact that it also extends means that it is compact when I need it to be and has a longer reach when I need help stretching to reach across the car. A great product from an innovative company!

{"asin":"B0002Z9L8K","overall":2,"reviewText":"At first look, the Heininger 1020 CommuteMate Flameless Flare seems like a good idea. In certain limited circumstances, I'm sure it might be useful. For most circumstances, however, I would only use it as an absolute last resort.The item is made of plastic. Not just any plastic, but appears to be manufactured of the kind of hard plastic that quickly turns very brittle and cracks when exposed to the extreme temperature variations found inside a vehicle, which after all, is where this item is meant to be kept. While it is battery powered, and doesn't really pose any kind of roadside fire hazard, its usefulness is severely limited.First of all, one has to rely on always having it loaded with good batteries. Dead batteries do noone any good, and I've found most people just throw items like this in the trunk or glove box, and forget about it, not really thinking to check the batteries regularly.But does it work? Well yes, sort of. The unit has a small lens powered by an LED that either blinks on and off, or lights up continuously. The continuous on is meant for a low-glare map light, while the blinking feature is meant to capture the attention of oncoming motorists. Unfortunately, the LED is not very bright, and is likely to go unnoticed from anyone farther away than 15 to 20 yards, and is so small and low intensity that even if noticed, it is doubtful anyone would recognize it as a hazard or warning beacon. While we certainly don't want anything so bright it blinds oncoming drivers, we also don't want something so dim that it doesn't trigger anyone's warning instincts soon enough.Interstate highway? Forget it, buy some reflective triangles. Rural highways? Not much of a chance of being seen in time at highway speeds. Well lit neighborhoods? It likely won't get noticed. From my perspective, about the only time a unit like this would attract any attention is if it was on a poorly lit rural backroad where the speed limit is 35 mph or under, and there are no other lights in the area to cause any distraction or overpower the weak light source this unit provides. Then, if your vehicle's hazard flashers don't work, by all means this is better than absolutely nothing. Just remember to check the batteries.","reviewerID":"A3G007LQX6KGOD","unixReviewTime":1285113600}

This filter element looked very similar to the used element I pulled out of the filter housing.  I purchased the filter element from Walmart for ~$6-$7, all local auto parts stores had this filter for $11-$14.  I also purchased from Amazon theK-D Tools 3253 End Cap Oil Filter Wrenchto remove the filter housing.I followed the instructions from a YouTube video \"2008 Highlander Oil Change\".  The video is for 6-cyl engine, but the process for 4-cyl is very similar, except that you do not have to remove anything to access the filter housing.  The filter housing is just behind the bumper cover.The process is a bit more complicated and messier than replacing a spin-on oil filter, but nothing too difficult to prevent me from doing it again.I gave this filter 4-star rating because there are higher efficiency filters for this application, e.g. Purolator PureOne PL25608, which also seems to have better construction.  Unfortunately, I could not find one for sale locally and it would cost $20+ from AdvancedAutoParts with S&H;, so buying Fram CH9972 made the most sense for me.UPDATE AUG-2010:  Check your local Toyota dealership for this filter cartridge.

{"asin":"B00002243Z","overall":4,"reviewText":"So these aren't the best cables you can buy.  For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: \"My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.\"  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and\/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.  Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe.","reviewerID":"A3GT2EWQSO45ZG","unixReviewTime":1292976000}

I bought this thinking the Bosch name would mean something, but it does not mean good in this case.  Not sure why they even developed this product.  I used this for one of my classic cars and as others have said, if the power is interrupted, you are back to square one and HAVE TO PUSH A BUTTON! terrible design and thinking on their part.  I highly recommend the CTEK version instead, I've been using it for years and it's brought back batteries that my regular 2amp\/15amp couldnt!  That's impressive.EDIT: The CTEK 3300 is a far superior device for the same money.  I've been trying to use the Bosch to get my camaro battery charged without success for the last two weeks.  I hooked up the CTEK yesterday and 4 hours later, the car started and was driveable.  The other advantage of the CTEK is the memory for knowing last state, so if there is power loss, it comes back to same place it was.  Also, once it's done charging, it goes into maintenance mode automatically.

Whistler decided it was a good idea to put them on the inside of the inverter instead of making it easy to replace them on the outside of it. But wait it gets better. They are soldered in which makes it a PITA to replace. The reviews say they don't blow easily, unless you are an idiot and hook the pos and neg up backwards. Then you deserve to spend the time to re-solder new fuses in. But seriously this is an outstanding inverter. I have already used it a bunch of times using drills, sanders, and a dremel in the first week of getting it. Other websites give a description saying it comes with 6 foot cables but thats combining both which are really 3 feet each (pos and neg). The terminals are on the wimpy side but who cares, this thing kicks butt. I wish it came with a digital display that shows the watts, volts, amps, etc like the larger units have. Its a perfect size and has the tabs on the base to mount it to whatever tickles your fancy. Don't expect it to come with the cigarette attachment thingy. Its too big and will blow your vehicle cigarette outlet fuses. Most people assume the mid size inverters come with it. They don't. Get over it. Just use the alligator clamps and throw it on your battery or be a man and hard wire it into your rig. Buy it right now.Edit...I just used this inverter to power a small George Foreman Grill!

Ultimately, there was no way of finding out whether I needed the OE or UB version of this wiper blade. I got one of each. The OE version is for those cars that use this style of wiper blade as original equipment and as it turns out, the OE version fits perfectly well once you figure out which of the several adaptors included is required and how to install it on the blade. The instructions are less than clear but after several attempts, I was able to install it. It fits well and operates properly. It rained today so I used it and found that it runs smoothly and without noise or skipped spots. The UB version has a different set of attachments and would not fit with any of the provided adaptors. Based upon the inaccurate information scattered about the web, some related to older iterations of Anco Contour blades, you might want to purchase this at a location where you can try it out and immediately return it if it proves not to fit.

That being said, considering the cost, you get a good product if you understand its limitations.The device itself is no-nonsense - a digital display that is accurate to 0.5 PSI (I wish it was accurate to 0.1 since the reading tends to bounce as you close in on .25 and .75 increments, but that's nitpicking on my part), a PSI\/bar\/kPa selection button that doubles as a reset button, \"+\" and \"-\" buttons to select your preset pressure, a carry handle, an emergency light, and two switches (compressor on\/off and light on\/flash\/off) are all that's visible on the outside. The DC plug and the air hose, as well as three basic attachments (you can see them in the picture on the removed door), are in a hidden compartment in the rear of the compressor. This is a nice touch, as you won't have any tangled cords or missing pieces since the compressor holds everything.Hooking it up to inflate two truck tires up to 32 PSI from 12 PSI and 20 PSI, the compressor averaged about +1 PSI per minute: not fast, and certainly not what you would get at a gas station's air pump, but definitely acceptable for an emergency situation. The pump was starting to get hot by the time I was done, so don't expect to be able to inflate four tires at once without letting the machine rest for a few between tires. The compressor is also a bit quieter than other emergency compressors I've used, but since the plastic is so light it tends to vibrate a lot, which leads to the compressor \"walking\" as it's inflating, though the 18\" or so hose ensures it can's go too far. The automatic shutoff kicks in one PSI above your preset (i.e. if your preset is 32 PSI, it will switch off once it reads 33.0 the first time, which will actually be around 32.75).All in all, this is a good emergency pump - just keep in mind that's what it is, and you'll be fine.","reviewerID":"A3KZ7OH4VRL048","unixReviewTime":1372464000}

I was mystified that some of the reviewers apparently only installed one or the other of the horns.  They are meant to be installed as a pair (even if you only have one horn as original equipment).  If you do have only one horn its a simple matter to re-wire for two horns.  The package includes simple easy to follow wiring diagrams and a pair of ground wires (one for each horn).  In my case I had one power wire to one horn, so I joined two wires together at the male end (to plug into the power lead) and two separate female ends to plug into the horns.  Same arrangement for the ground except the joined end is attached to the frame of the car for a ground.  I installed both horns side by side on the tab the original horn was attached to.

I'd much rather a bright read as it can be easier to find if dropped in snow. Other than that, very happy.","reviewerID":"A3NXJDNTQK2YJL","unixReviewTime":1372982400}

The clay will remove heavy contaminants and prep the surface to be smooth. It so happens I use the mothers california gold clay bar kit which IMO is the best for the price. The detailer is just ok, the clay is great and so is the premium microfiber towel. The reason why I mentioned all of this is that you need to prep your car before starting to use the 1-2-3 system.So on to the actual review, the step one part they call a pre wax cleaner. If I'm not mistaken it is either a very mild type of car polish and may contain abrasives. Basically it will smooth out your cars surface, and make it shiny from the clear coat surface. I think it did a fair job making it shine and removing surface residue from the clay and detailer. It did an okay job so far with very light swirlmarks. since I am unfamiliar with other polishing compounds that I have been hearing about I will give this product of 3.5 rounded to 4 stars. just because I like it enough for the ease of use\/money\/amount and ending result.

{"asin":"B006JG5BLM","overall":5,"reviewText":"A powerful inflator, with a great screw-on hose design, and a so-so gauge.What I like best is the screw-on hose.  No more trying to flip a clamp quickly enough to prevent losing air from the freshly-inflated tire (or deflating it further when you first attach the inflator)-- there's the briefest hiss of air when you screw the hose onto the valve.  This feature alone is to make me really like the BellAire 4000.Also, it fills the tires faster than my standby battery-poweredSlime COMP07 Inflator, and much faster than either of my old (since-retired) 12V inflators. I have not had any problems with it blowing out the 12V socket's fuse, although that is a risk with this kind of inflator.The unit is compact, not as loud as other inflators I've used. It comes with a nylon carry-bag (fitted to not add bulk) which will decrease the inevitable gunking-up of car accessories that live in the trunk, and has storage for both the hose and power cord (which also keeps them from being damaged as they ride around in your trunk).  The power cord seems long enough for most standard passenger vehicles. All of these are signs that the designers were actually thinking about how this inflator will be used and stored.The flashing hazard light is a nice touch also, in the unfortunate case of needing to do a roadside inflation. The onboard worklight has 3 small LEDs in a swivel head, which is handy, but would be more useful if brighter.The major flaw in the unit is, predictably, the pressure gauge, which is only vaguely accurate (analog) and has an outer dial to set the desired pressure.  The inflator is designed to stop when the pressure set on the gauge is reached, but since the gauge isn't accurate, I got results like setting the gauge to above 35, with 31 PSI in the tire, and having the unit refuse to fill until I set the dial to 40PSI.  This means you need a separate tire pressure gauge and may have to disconnect the hose a couple of times to check the actual pressure.  Effectively, the pressure setting becomes only a safety cut-off \"ceiling\".So what this inflator could really use is an onboard, accurate digital gauge.  Since I can buy a decent, accurate, handheld digital gauge for 10 bucks, it seems like integrating that function into an inflator should be easy.Other quibbles: The tight-fitting nylon bag is almost too small.  The cable storage compartment could be a little bigger. The carry-handle is a simple plastic ring that protrudes from the top of the inflator-- a proper padded handle (maybe a T-shaped one) could have fit in the same spot.  Without the handle, the unit is a bit awkward to carry one-handed (although it isn't heavy).The one big feature I would add to this unit would be an AC-power adapter, since when I use it in my enclosed garage, I have to open the garage door, start the car, back it out partway, and then use the unit.  An AC adapter would make it so I could just plug into the wall at home, but still be able to do emergency roadside work with the 12V adapterSo could this inflator be improved? Certainly, with a better handle, more accurate and digital gauge, a brighter LED, and support for AC power. But hands-down it's the best tire inflator I've used, so I still give it 5-stars.  Recommended.","reviewerID":"A3Q4TYJVAM4IRM","unixReviewTime":1384992000}

I like these pad very much. I use Meguiar's Ultimate Polish with this pad to remove minor swirls and minor scratches on the clean coat of my car. I place product on the pad, lay it on the car and turn on the polisher so as not to sling product. The Porter Cable 7336 polisher is not the most powerful, so when I first begin polishing, the machine rotates the pad when I don't add much pressure. However, as the product becomes loaded with wet polish, the pad begins to drag and loses its rotation. It helps that the pad is not &#34;so&#34; thick and that the edges are tapered. I've solved the problem by having a second pad to change out to finish the second half of the vehicle. The pads are easy to clean and I let them dry with the Velcro pad facing up.

They seem pretty well made (in China) and from the reviews will give me the traction I need.I have mounted the non-defective one on a wheel and installation is as easy as they say. The chains are coated in some kind of material that gets all over your hands, which is why they give you gloves I suppose. But, the gloves are too flimsy to last; keep a pair of cheap work gloves in the container.The rubber tensioner is probably the most difficult part of the installation; it takes some strength, particularly in the wrists, to stretch it enough the last 2 clips. But, it makes for a very snug secure installation.The reason for the 3 stars is that one of the two 'chains' had a cable twisted around itself, rendering it useless. I'll have to send it back.Advice to anyone who buys these things (or any chains); put them on the vehicle as soon as you get them and well before you will need them. They may be defective, as mine were.But also, you don't want to be figuring out how they are supposed to be mounted when you're hip-deep in snow or stuck on the side of a road with other vehicles slip-sliding your way.The plastic container has finicky hinges and clasp; a different model of this chain comes in a bag instead of a plastic box; you may want to consider getting that one instead.","reviewerID":"A3RW6YDNILSLXP","unixReviewTime":1329091200}

{"asin":"B00AX4TWAM","overall":5,"reviewText":"The first thing I noticed when opening this container of Griot's Garage 11029 Premium Carnauba Paste Wax, was the fragrance. It had a pleasant, fresh, almost floral scent rather than a heavy chemical one like some car waxes.  It also has a very nice consistency, creamy and smooth and easy to spread on the car's finish. The instructions say to not let the wax dry completely before polishing, so doing a small area at a time and then polishing that area seemed like a good way to use this product. It comes with a densely textured application sponge or you could use an orbital motorized polisher.  I did it by hand. A little of this wax goes a long way. I was surprised at how little I had to use. At this price that's a good thing because these 14 ounces will polish a lot of cars!  After applying it to the surface of the car I allowed it to cure for 3-5 minutes and then used a soft microfiber cloth to polish it.  It took a fair amount of work (good exercise!) but the car looked really, really shiny when I finished. It doesn't dry to a powder which is nice because you don't have any white gunk in the crevices or around door handles or trim. In fact, you can use it on plastic or rubber trim according to the instructions.  I did the polishing in the sun but it wasn't too hot that day. I think if it were a typical hot summer day, it might dry too fast so in that case it would be better to find some shade.  This wax gave it a deep glow, the type you can only get from polishing a car with real paste wax rather than just using some pour-on polish.After doing the whole car I wanted to test to see how water would react on the surface, so I got out the hose and gave it a quick spray. The water beaded up very nicely, actually better than I've seen with any other wax or finish. It takes a little bit of time and patience to wax a car with this wax, but the results are so worth it.","reviewerID":"A3S3R88HA0HZG3","unixReviewTime":1368489600}

It's clear from the description that this is a PAIR of wheel chocks, not two pair, not one chock.  The 2 are NOT \"screwed together\" as mentioned in another review.  The manufacturer attaches them with a plastic fastener called a \"christmas tree.\"  It's similar to the plastic fasteners that hold interior door panels on a car.  This is removable; the 2 chocks are separated for use.  Granted, it's a little difficult to pull them apart, a pair of pliers helps.  It would be dangerous to leave the 2 wheel chocks attached as shipped to try to prevent a car or RV from moving.Now for some actual, useful information about the wheel chocks.  I bought these to stabilize my cars when jacking them to service brakes, tires, etc.  My garage floor is painted with epoxy paint.  Even with the anti-slip additive in the paint, several other wheel chocks I have tried always slipped and moved on the epoxy floor.  These Blitz Tire Hugger Wheel Chocks have held firm on the floor every time.  As with any wheel chock, it's important to make sure it's firmly wedged between the tire and the floor.  A quick firm kick to wedge the chock in place is all I ever need on my slippery garage floor.I don't think these would be useful outdoors on an unpaved surface, such as with an RV or trailer in the woods.  But then, it dozen't seem that's how they are being marketed anyway, and I haven't tried them in this application.

Also, just a word of caution, wear latex or vinyl gloves if you can to prevent the black wax and pre-finish from getting on your skin and under your nails.When the car was done it shined very nicely with a beautiful black sheen that masked a multitude of scratches. The 15-year old car looked just great.I can speak to durability yet and I'm tempted to put a coat of conventional clear wax on top of the black wax.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to enhance the look of their black car.

That is quite a good deal considering buying these seperate can cost 2-3 dollars.  Anyways, the size isn't too large and it isn't too small, it's perfect.  I also got 12 yellow, 12 green, and 12 blue which I was hoping because I didn't want all one color like some people claimed.  I took the advice from someone else who ordered them.  I have the blue ones in the garage for the car, the yellow in the kitchen for the countertop and dishes, and the green ones upstairs in the laundry room for upstairs use.  Each one has a tag on it on how to wash it and stuff, which I don't like but I don't want to pull it off and ruin the towel so it will stay on I guess.  Anyways, I bought these for cleaning my car so it gets dry and I use them for dusting.  It's a dust magnet, the stuff really shines after quickly wiping them off with one of these towels.  Good towels and definately worth the money without question.:Update:So I have been using these things for a couple days and let me tell you, what a great value for what you get.  These things pick up stuff so well.  I just washed our kitchen floor with one of them and it picked up almost every single hair and particle imaginable.  It used to take me like 5 wipes across with a regular rag to get the stuff but it sticks to one of these things so simple.  I hope it comes out in the wash though, I tried to squeeze some of the stuff out and some came out but not everything.  Either way it made the cleaning so much easier.  Maybe I will have a dirty one dedicated to just the kitchen floor so I don't ruin them all.  Anyways, go out and get these things you won't regret it.  They are worth more than a dollar a piece and Amazon's deal is fantastic.:Update-2:I have had this same pack of 36 for probably a year now.  I am down to my last few though, so I am going to re-order.  I used them very heavily and 23 dollars lasting me a year, these things are way worth it.  I used them to clean my car interior\/windows.  I used them to clean kitchen sinks and coffee tables.  The dust these things pick up is remarkable.  I used them very heavily to clean our tile kitchen floor and wooden floors.  I think that's the reason I threw some out because they got so picked up with dirt and grime.  Our kitchen floors take in heavy traffic and after using these with some all purpose cleaner on the kitchen floor, it looks like new.  For dusting stuff off they are amazing.  I don't know what else to say, but I am pretty sure this is the longest review I have here on Amazon, and I have quite a few reviews.  These things have made our house spick and span, and I am a very picky cleaner.

We thought that the various connectors meant that it would connect properly - but as it turns out it would not connect properly. So the review that follows is for the other contour blade we received, a different length, for our other car.We got a single ANCO 22\" contour blade to review, and we reviewed it side by side against a new regular ANCO (non-countour) blade on the other side of the front windshield. I own a Subaru Forester. The Contour blade was slightly clearer and slightly quieter. Both were just as easy to put on and remove.I'm 44 and have been driving since I was 16. In those years I definitely learned early on the value of using a good quality windshield wiper. After all, it's a relatively cheap part which can help prevent a quite expensive (and harmful) accident. So definitely I would say if you're currently using a cheap windshield wiper blade that it's well worth upgrading to something good quality.Do you need to go from normal ANCO to the contour ANCO? Again, I would say it's worth having the best you can get. This is about seeing the road in front of you in an already slick situation. You've got enough else to worry about in a thunderstorm or snowstorm. You don't need to worry about being able to see the road on top of everything else.I'll update this when both wear out, to give notes on the durability of them, but I assume both will have the normal range of durability.","reviewerID":"A3V6Z4RCDGRC44","unixReviewTime":1369699200}

{"asin":"B00032K3RA","overall":4,"reviewText":"Just installed this today. July 23, 2013 on the rear of our 2006 Lincoln Town Car and it looks just right. It's made of chrome plated metal (zinc) not plastic. As received, the chrome finish is fine, but after reading reviews about it deteriorating, I gave it a coat of Simoniz front and back including the mounting tabs before mounting. Hope it will help to retard oxidation. I replaced the UGLY black dealership advertising frame with this one and it looks great. Many cars have only two mounting screw anchors at the top of the plate. Initially with the two screws tightened, the bottom of the plate stuck out. I had to gently bend the license plate very slightly to make it not quite flat so it fit flush with the frame at the bottom and all around. It might also be corrected by adding two SHORT mounting screws and nuts to attach the bottom of the plate to only the frame tabs.The \"perimeter\" frame mounts BEHIND the license plate hiding the mounting tabs, thereby exposing the entire plate: just the simple narrow chrome frame shows. Also, no grief from fussy police or vehicle inspectors because of an obscured state name, motto, etc. I found very few available perimeter frames and for Amazon's cheap price of this one, if it only lasts a year I'll buy a couple more of them. Will likely buy one or two for our other car as well. I would have given it 5 stars, but for the possible impending corrosion mentioned in several reviews. Mounting screws were not included with the frame.Update 4\/5\/14 Uh, oh. Downgraded to 2 stars.The nasty snowy, salty winter we had here in NJ took its toll and pitted the chrome frames despite the Simoniz treatment. I plan to order 2 new ones and try clear-coating them on both sides to see if that helps preserve them.","reviewerID":"A3VBDOG1R3GPKW","unixReviewTime":1374537600}

{"asin":"B000GPV2QA","overall":1,"reviewText":"I own a previous version of this jump starter. My was made by UST and not Wagan. The exterior is identical to my unit so I assume it is made by the same manufacturer. I normally recharge it every two months even if I have not used it to maintain a full charge for when I need to jump start a car. I forgot to charge it for about 5 months and the unit is completely dead. I have try to charge it but when you press the battery status button, you can see the voltage just keep dropping. I have try to recharge it several times and I think the battery is completely dead. The charger adapter is also dead. I measure the output voltage and it measures a little over 3 volts. I take special care of my adapters so I do not damage the wires. This unit was only used several times to add air to several tires. It has not been used to jump start. Overall very bad quality.I also have a Vector unit which is now Black and Decker and it also was not charged for 5 months. This unit still had two red lights which indicate it was in good condition. I recharge it for several hours and it came back with full power. I also own Jump and Carry JNC660 jump starter. This is a professional unit with 1700 peak amps. It can hold a charge for months and still show plenty of power. This unit is the best but expensive ($130). This unit can jump start big engines and completely dead batteries.One other general comment for those people out there assessing which jump starter to buy. These lower cost, lower peak amp starters are only good for cars that has a weak battery (i.e. as engine is slow to crank over). If your battery is dead where the engine cannot even slowly crank over, these starter will not have enough power to start your car so do not blame the jump starter as low quality. I see such comments in other reviews. For a completely dead battery, you need a more powerful jump starter such as JNC660. I have the same problem with my Vector starter which has only 300 peak amps. It also would not start a completely dead battery. That was the reason I bought the JNC660 and carry it in which ever car we own that has the oldest battery. I need to buy another jump starter (I keep one in each car) and am thinking of buying JNC300XL which claims to have 900 peak amp and is about half the price of JNC660. The reviews seem very good and is made by the same company.","reviewerID":"A3VY9YIPPDQEWD","unixReviewTime":1266364800}

This one certainly seems to be the best at rejuvenating leather.  You can feel the waxy film on your fingers after applying it, which you don't notice with other conditioners, and shows it has somethign substantial in it.All my vehicles have had leather seats and after a few years they have all had dry, cracked creases.  I have just got a \"new\" used minivan with leather seats and I want to ensure they don't go the same way.  I have to admit I've neglected seats compared with the rest of the vehicle.I used this product on my 1998 pickup's tan-colored front seats which are creased and starting to crack in places.  They were pretty dirty and the only way I found to get the grime out was using a Magic Eraser and leather cleaning solution.  This is a pretty harsh technique, but effective, apart from in the deepest creases.  It did seem to take the shine off the leather, which was a worry.  Using the Lexol conditioner, letting it soak in for 15 mins and then buffing with a microfiber cloth, the sheen is back and the leather feels much more supple.  It will never return to its \"new\" state, but it should last a few more years with regular applications (not sure but maybe every 3-4 months?).  It takes some effort to get through the stickiness at the first buffing, but the surface quickly eases up and a nice sheen (not a false shine) appears.On my minivan, the leather came up like it was just new.  It smells good too!I bought this product at my local Advance Auto (sorry Amazon!) and would certainly suggest you pay the extra $3-4 over the other conditioners as it really seems to be properly designed to replace the oils in the leather, not just put a protectant shine on the surface.  I'm always sceptical about product claims (since they usually exaggerate performance), but this one seems to be the real deal.Try it.UPDATE (Dec 3 2009):The stiff leather has certainly become more supple after applying this product - it works really well!","reviewerID":"A4WCZVA328QB4","unixReviewTime":1255132800}

{"asin":"B005EJGSQ2","overall":3,"reviewText":"I was initially surprised at the quality of this for being so cheap. I have purchased a few amazon basic items and have been happy with all of them. This headed seat cover is no different. instructions are a bit straightforward. it has an elastic band on the back to keep itself 'roughly' in the right spot. Instructions say you can leave it like that or use the additional tie down straps ( that also come with hooks). Straps are fine but are extremely short, so as most other reviewers have mentioned, have to use something like string or bungee cords to lock down if you really want it not to slide around. I have this over a leather seat which gets extremely cold in the winter, but it slides like its on ice if its not bungee corded down to the seat. Install was a joke, five minutes? maybe? Hardest part is deciding how you want to anchor it. Low heat works fine, its nice but has to be on for quite a while before its 'comfortably' warm. However you can feel heat after about one minute after you turn it on. High heat works really nice, extremely warm, I prefer this one, unless I am on a drive longer than 30 minutes, then switch it to low or just off because my car is really warm by then. Do heed the warnings, and unplug it while not using. It has a nifty red light on the plugin so you can see if you left it on\/plugged in. The seat in my vehicle has side airbag, and 1 armrest(on the opposite side of the airbag) and i was able to fit this without modification to the seat as to not interfere with either one. So after all is said and done, I am extremely happy with my purchase. Does exactly what it is suppose to do and was a very reasonable(cheap) fix for my cold bum! Would definitely buy again.Edit on 2-1-14I bought this and it was delivered on 10-31-13 and as of today(2-1-14) it no longer puts out heat. checked the fuses and tried and multiple 12-volt plug ins and it will not work. I will probably opt for the professionally installed heated pads next time since it couldn't even last one season. rating downgrade from 5 to 3 stars as at least the price wasn't wallet shattering.","reviewerID":"A50W36ATFDSNU","unixReviewTime":1384473600}

That is a thoughtful touch - normally I have to futz too much with getting a wiper to fit, clipping things to 'make' them fit.They work well in the rain, clearing off a nice section to see out of, as all wipers do when they are new. They work smoothly and evenly over the glass.They don't work as well for dust, but that's really not what these are made for.Although these are touted as being superior for cold weather, the real test for me will be this summer, in the Arizona desert temperatures. Usually any wipers I install around spring end up warped by the heat a few months later.

Toyota changed from spin-off into element type filters starting with the 2008 model year but the Lexus had these since 2000 in the RX line.

Having worked at a high-end dealership and closely with the auto industry, I can tell you that they do oil changes as fast as your neighborhood &#34;quick-lube&#34; outlet.  Many mechanics are professional and torque bolts properly but there are also an equal amount who just don't care.Purchase your 0W20 synthetic oil from Amazon, as well as the proper filter socket and your oil change will cost you less than $50.

I have used all the most popular detailers out there, but not one of them even comes close to this NXT Speed Detailer. They have taken Show room finish to a new level. I am just so amazed as to how beautiful my cars look now. Good job Meguiar's!!Pros:Clean your car in minutes without having to wash your car.A shine and wet look finish that is just so amazing that you have to see it to believe it.Very inexpensive. Cheaper than going to a car wash and more convenient. One bottle will last a very long time.Cleans the whole car exterior. Wheels, glass, plastic trim, rubber, headlights, tail lights and paint.Does not wash off with rain or car washes.Cons:It would be nice if they included a free Microfiber cloth, but no big deal.Summary:This is the best all around product you can buy to clean, beautify, and protect your car. Meguiar's has set the bar very high with this product.The proper way to detail your car FOR THE FIRST TIME is to do the ff:1. Wash your car with the NXT car wash. Dry.2. Use Mequiar's Clay bar.3. Apply NXT Speed Detailer on the entire exterior. Paint, Glass, Plastics, wheels, headlights, tail lights. I have even used this to clean and detail the engine compartment.4. Apply NXT Speed wax by hand or NXT Wax using a buffer to the paint.5. Apply Meguiar's Insane shine tire spray. No need to wipe tire. Just let it dry.For the succeeding cleaning, you will just need to do step 3, 4 and 5. This is the most efficient way to detail your car.  You can certainly buy the other Meguair's products specific to the task, but my way saves me so much time because I dont need to stop and switch products. 1 to 5 can be done in about 2 hours. Steps 3 to 5 can be done in 20 minutes.","reviewerID":"A5CDMTW6JKV5G","unixReviewTime":1286236800}

I did not have any streaks or other problems the other reviewers are having.I used my clay bar before waxing, maybe this made the difference.As far as durability goes, I have not had it for more than 1 week, so I cannot tell yet, but am confident it will be same if not better in durability.Conclusion: If you have metallic paint, I would Definitely give this a try!

I excitedly tried this one out on my SUV tonight, and had mixed feelings:THE GOOD:It works very well to push large amounts of snow off cleanly-- even did a better job than my usual brush, with much less effort.THE BAD:The locking mechanism and connection to the \"broom.\" My hands were very cold, which made it hard to screw on the foam \"broom\" to the handle, but I got it. Then I tried to pull out the telescoping handle, and couldn't. I had to step on the foam and pull up on the handle. That worked. However, it wouldn't stay locked in the \"out\" position. While I was pushing the snow around, the handle kept retracting. That would be pain enough, but here's what was worse:The handle ALSO kept unscrewing from the foam. The foam was actually spinning around in the wind. I couldn't get it to stay securely on, even though I tightened it as far as it would go. The slightest movement made it loosen and start unscrewing again.So, in short, I'll still keep it handy because even with the annoyances, it got the job done faster than with a brush and scraper and with less worry about scratching my car, but if I were looking for a snow broom, I'd try a different model first.","reviewerID":"A5GPH59NDWJRB","unixReviewTime":1356739200}

It doesn't provide as lasting a shine as traditional waxes that are rubbed on and left to dry, but it only takes about 10 minutes to do the whole car, and the results are impressive.I use one microfiber cloth to spread the product after lightly spraying a section, followed immediately by a second dry microfiber cloth to buff the wax. I use very little product, just a light spray does the trick, so this 24-oz bottle goes a long way. Like all waxes, it should only be applied to a clean car, and it won't remove surface dirt or finish imperfections - that's what Mother's Clay Bar is for!Also, this wax does not leave any white residue on black plastic trim, so any overspray on trim is no problem, just wipe it off.Highly recommended!","reviewerID":"A6I0LUYEHG4KC","unixReviewTime":1369094400}

It comes with a stir stick, pint of paint, spray can of degreaser, masking tape, and a brush to paint with. The process was painless to paint the calipers. I gave 4 calipers 3 coats of paint and barely used an inch from the can. I did have blue so maybe it covers better than some colors, but 1 coat was almost good enough. The result is all in the prep. You spend time cleaning and masking and the paint job goes very quick. I just painted the front and sides, bottom and tops but left the back.  It dries very quickly for recoat in 5 minutes. I had the car on jack stands on one side front and rear so I could cover both at once. Very little brush marks and the last coat I left to dry till I finished the other caliper 2 coats. This was about 1\/2 hour. If you wait past an hour they recommend you let it dry for 5 hours before recoating to avoid bubbling. It is very glossy when done. If you order blue, pay close attention to the color as I was duped into thinking the color actually was represented on the package. It is very different and much darker, almost navy blue.I could have stopped there, but after having 2 calipers cleaned and prepped, masked off I thought I would carry on by chance it would look ok. For this unintentional deception I deducted a star, but am very impressed with the product otherwise. I will probably buy another kit to repaint them black as I am very unhappy with the color for my purposes.","reviewerID":"A6TW412I6RWID","unixReviewTime":1364947200}

Displeased with the results, I restored the headlight lenses with the 3M kit.  The lenses were crystal clear to the naked eye and the light thrown by the SilverStars appeared pure white from the driver's seat but head-on the headlights still revealed a trace of yellow.  In addition to oxidation, plastic headlight lenses yellow over time on the inside.  The only 100% solution: replace the lenses.That said, when I replaced the stock low-beams on my 2013 Subaru Impreza hatchback, the CrystalVision Ultra H11s delivered 99.99999% of the marketing claims.  The light output is pure white from both the driver's seat and to oncoming traffic but without the harsh glare of misaligned or aftermarket HIDs.  At certain angles, one can see a trace of the blue tips in the reflector but it's not the cheesy blue of non-steet-legal bulbs.  Longevity is unknown at this time, but I donated the Legacy to charity with the SilverStars installed after at least three years of nighttime-only operation (the Impreza uses the 9005 high-beams as daytime running lights).  We can only hope the CrystalVisions perform as well.","reviewerID":"A6VPIOPMDJ8H7","unixReviewTime":1391472000}
{"asin":"B001GJ3EJS","overall":4,"reviewText":"Primarily intended to be used on automobiles, with bristles which are of medium softness, Mothers Detail brush is not supposed to do any damage to painted surfaces, providing it is not used dry.  This far, that claim seems to be true, as the brush has not done any damage to the finishes on my car.The handle is well designed, providing a nice solid grip, even when your hands are wet, while also allowing for applying leverage.  The brush is a little on the thin side, so you're generally not able to attack a large area, but the bristles, which are about 0.9\" long, do provide a little extended reach.The soft bristles however, are kind of a double-edged sword.  The brush doesn't tend to scratch surfaces, but the bristles do seem to get deformed rather easily.  When tackling a tough job, like wheel rims, you can apply a lot of muscle, and the brush still does only an average job of cleaning.  Because the bristles tend to get bent out of shape rather easily, you can expect to replace them rather frequently, so it's good that these brushes come in a pack of two, and are not that expensive.These bright red brushes by Mothers, do a fairly good job, and can be used for detailing, but they don't stand up to heavy use very well, so you may need to be prepared to replace them on a regular basis.","reviewerID":"A6VXZ1EEPRTLV","unixReviewTime":1373155200}

Yes it may make it so that you don't spill when pouring or have a funnel BUT it also didn't fit in most of my jugs.  Also, no cap = it drips out onto your floor after you're done pouring it. New concrete? Hope you like an oil spot on it.#2 Open pan design means everything in the world gets into it.  Granted, it's oil it's dirty and it's used, but I still don't like having everything collect and get dirty in my pan that I can see.  Not to mention if you have pets and you leave it sitting around for a little bit then you're going to worry about them getting into it or spilling it etc.#3 It isn't THAT thin.  It doesn't fit under my 2004 Tiburon when it isn't jacked up. Do other pans? I don't know, but this one doesn't.#4 It is WAY over priced.  I don't know why I was suckered into buying a pan this expensive.  As another reviewer said, I saw an identical one at a parts store for around $10. Quality difference? Nope. If there was then by the time you ruined that one you'd see these design flaws and want another. I accidentally doubled my order of these and never got around to returning it too so I'm stuck.All that being said, it does seem sturdy. It does its job.

When it comes to engine life, it is more about changing the oil & filter when required and not so much about what oil or filter you use.  Not that there are not valid arguments that if you use a certain oil or filter you can expect longer engine life.  I'm sure that's true.  But no, much simpler than that.  When trying to figure for yourself what oil and filter to use, ask yourself when was the last time you wore out an engine.  Most folks replace cars every 4 years.  I've personally owned one I bought new for over 20 years (130K miles) and another for over 15 (135K miles) and another for 250K miles (don't remember the years).  I changed the oil & filter religiously on all at 5000 mile intervals.  I used anything from premium filters to Walmart Tech filters and oil to premium synthetic oil & filters.  None of them EVER had an engine problem.  The cars around those engines fall apart eventually.  That's my point.  So many people think that they have to use this or that so that they can get the most life from a car that they themselves will be replacing in about 4 years anyhow.  They don't even give themselves a chance to wear it out.So....  Change the oil & filter regularly and with what is recommended by the manufacturer.  &#34;Meet the specs&#34; and worry not.  Just my 2 cents.","reviewerID":"A91BVZEDZYEWW","unixReviewTime":1370563200}

It seems to cancel out a lot of the small movements created by the trailer and makes the tow vehicle ride better and feel more stable.  The only disadvantage I have found is that the sway control \"groans\" going around corners.  This is one of those \"that is just the way it works\" situations, but it would be nice if it were quieter.  It also adds another step to hitching up the trailer, but the sway control is very easy to install and remove.

{"asin":"B000SQFD4O","overall":5,"reviewText":"The following review is for the Dynaplug tool.  This item is for the refill for that tool. The refills will store readily inside the handle.After living in Downtown Los Angeles for over 2 years, I have had about 5 bouts of tire leaks due to punctures.  Before I found out about this product, I used the traditional DIY method of repairing my tire--with a kit I got at Pep Boys.  It was always an exhausting, time consuming process.  I'm not a very strong person and most of the punctures were with small objects (pallet nails, staples). Imagine having to stuff a thick, dull rasp tool through extremely thick tire tread.. Not fun.  Threading a thick rubber embedded cord through a very thin slot was always a pain in the butt too.  Always ended up having to fumble with needle nose pliers to pull it through requiring  several tries.Along comes this product. All I can say is WOW!!!  Slick it up, insert the little plug into the tool, slick up the tool and hole with some more spit, and push it in.  The tool is smooth and goes in with way less effort.  Pull it out and snip the remainder.  Done!  By a very large margin, the absolute EASIEST tire repair tool you will EVER use.For *extremely* small holes, it can still require a bit of effort, but no where near the unimaginable effort that would have been required of the typical rasp and thread-end tools.  Just be sure to use spit.  (Water doesn't work nearly as well).Summary:PROS:-Makes repairing the smallest leaks much easier.-Fast.  Can repair a tire in half the time.  Some have even repaired their tires without removing them.-Permanent. Dynaplugs have been approved in Europe for permanent tire repair.-Use way less strength.  Only a single tool, and it is very thin.-Convenient storage in handle for extra plugs, and the pipe cleaner. There is enough room to even store a couple of small alchohol swabs in it.-Can be used to repair previous traditional plugs that have failed.-Fool proof.  Awesome design allows you to push the tool in ALL THE WAY, and pull out.  Traditional plugging can be pushed in too far or not far enough.-Can repair other failed patches.-Versatile.  Dynaplug can be applied multiple times to the same hole to repair larger holes.CONS:-The tool may get dirty on the inside and be hard to insert additional plugs in the same session.  The tool comes with a felt pipe cleaner which can be dabbed in alcohol to clean the inside.  Best way to avoid this is to ensure the plug and tool is well lubricated.","reviewerID":"A9X2MLWQOALBW","unixReviewTime":1326240000}

Now that maybe just a memory lane thing since this works just fine. If you don't want to dry, and as I do stretch and soften a natural chamois after use, then get this. It works very well, plus I have never found anything synthetic, that works as well. (Believe me I've tried a lot different ones too. Haaa)  I do recommend it.

I was ready to give up right there until I saw another reviewer had a similar issue, and that it would work again after being unplugged from power and plugged back in.  Right there, that makes this unit a fail for me since if you have to remove power between wheels, it becomes much more of a pain to deal with.  But a few days later, it actually did NOT kill the display after shutting off automatically with one tire, so it wasn't just by design, it seems to just be totally intermittent.The ability to set a pressure and let it stop when it hits that pressure is a great concept, but this thing hasn't worked anything nearly as advertised.  I set if for 38 PSI, since my tires max at 44, and the manufacturer suggests 33, but I like a little stiffer wheels than that.  On one tire it shut off about 37.5, on another I had to stop it at 39 myself because it never did shut off.  On the other two it was about 37.5 or so, acceptable.  You can pick in 1 PSI increments above 30, and it reads in 1\/2 PSI increments.  But when I tested with a very good tire pressure gauge, the readings this was giving was really around the scale.  The tire that was inflated to 39 PSI before I shut it off myself was actually at 41.  One of the ones that shut off about 37.5, one was actually 35, one was actually 37.Then there's the issue with the rubber inside the valve piece.  The very first tire I put this on and then removed, a piece of the rubber seal inside the nozzle fell to the floor.  It's like it's dry rotted already or something.  And the plastic lever to lock and unlock is not very strong at all, and bends to the point I'm afraid it will snap when I'm putting it on or off.Nothing about this unit screams quality, which would explain the low price.

The light is the really \"white\" light but it is fine. I didn't bother looking at the color of the wires. If the light didn't come on I just reversed the connection. They mount easily on the metal heat shield in our fixtures. It isn't quite as bright as a single 921 bulb (I had removed one of the bulbs from the double fixtures to reduce electric needs when on battery) so I ordered 5 more to use in both sides of the double fixtures.  Then I ordered 4 more to use in more fixtures. One of these required some jiggling to get it to come on and 3 of the 36 LED's don't work. Have driven about 100 miles on bumpy roads with these in place and they are working fine. New Jersey state parks don't have any hookups for camping so we do a lot of \"dry\" camping - the battery life is certainly extended with these LED's rather than incandescent bulbs. At this time I recommend them - time will tell if they continue to work so well.  UPDATE: When I told BestDealUSA about the \"bad\" light they immediately sent me a replacement. You can't beat that.

After removing the door mold from the painted finish I used this product in conjunction with a plastic scraper.  Until I scraped most of the adhesive off with the scraper this did almost nothing.  It helped get the last little bit of adhesive residue off, but most of the result was due to &#34;hard labor&#34;.  Removing the adhesive from the plastic mold was even worse.  It did not seem to distort or discolor the finish on either part, but it was only marginally helpful in getting the adhesive to release.  I would have to agree with some other reviewers that there might be a less expensive product that would do about as well.  I hate the thought of having to do the other molding sections.

{"asin":"B003V3XA5A","overall":5,"reviewText":"I will start by declaring that I am a great fan of Griot's Garage products.  They make a range of car cleaning and finish-maintenance products which work and which, of equal importance, I feel are SAFE to use on my car.  Based on my experience in using their products for years, I use them with confidence that they do not contain harsh chemicals which will damage the finish of the paint, leather or plastic surfaces of my car.  They are expensive, but I find that I am more comfortable using Griot's products that many off-the-shelf, less expensive products sold at Auto Parts stores or large chain\/discount retailers.I am equally pleased with the Interior Kit, consisting of Cleaner and Vinyl and Rubber Dressing with applicator pads and cloths.  The Interior Cleaner works.  A stubborn stain may require multiple applications of the product, but I would rather apply a milder cleaner several times than risk damaging a surface with a stronger cleaner.  That said, my personal preference is to use the Griot's dedicated leather cleanerGriot's Garage 11142 Leather Care - 16 oz.for my leather surfaces rather than a more all-purpose cleaner such as the Interior Cleaner even though it says it is safe for leather surfaces.The rubber and vinyl dressing works well.  I have applied it to the rubber door and trunk seals on several cars and the dash on one car.  I like the fact that there is no pronounced smell or excessively glossy surface when applied to plastics (unlike Armor All).  Before applying the dressing to the rubber door and trunk seals on cars that are a few years old, it is wise to clean the rubber thoroughly using the Interior Cleaner or Griot's rubber cleanerGriot's Garage 11136 Rubber Cleaner - 35 oz..The microfiber towels work well and although the sponge applicators perhaps do soak up some of the product, they are often the most convenient method of applying the product.  In any event, I would not soak the sponge applicators to the point of saturation, however, as this could lead to drips and waste of the product.  Further, any of the product that migrates deep into the sponge can always be released by merely pressing a little harder on the surface to which you are applying it.In addition to making good car care products, it also may be useful to some to note that Griot's is also good at sourcing and selling hard to find or extremely useful tools.  I have purchased many over the years (e.g. solid, machined aluminum, lifetime water hose sprayer, no-drip caulk gun, a cam-locking bed separator gate for pickup trucks, etc.).","reviewerID":"ADXVZUT1HHW2M","unixReviewTime":1356566400}

These blades install very quickly just like the Bosch blades.  Just pull off the old blades and snap the new blades into place. It literally took me about 1 minute to replace them. It took me longer to get them out of the packaging which is a plastic container that is a little difficult to open. I did notice that they have a very strong plastic smell but that's not an issue once they are installed. It just stunk up my whole house when I first opened them. They fit perfectly and they were nice and secure. So far they give a nice clean and streak free windshield. It poured down rain the first day that I put them on and I could see perfectly. I haven't had a problem with streaking skipping at all. The only downside is that they don't look as nice as Bosch blades. Bosch blades are shinier and more modern looking. These blades are duller looking and have a more industrial look to them. So it really just depends on what you are looking for. If you are installing on a fancy car and care a lot about appearance then you way opt for a different brand.

I had forgotten that I purchased this a month ago and I called my husband to ask him if I should take the car to our mechanic. He told me to go home and hook this up and see if it can tell me what is wrong with the air. After a dozen or so tries to get the air on, I went inside and got the Actron CP9135 and hooked it up.

You have to guarantee you align the circle portion on the back of the wedge with the hole so that the knob thread will contact it for proper clamping. It is not a guarantee of it staying on because of that and the rather flexible plastic shell. The ridges on the mirror portion itself forming a 'groove' for the wedge are too shallow to keep it in place while putting it on so it becomes a battle. Seems it would be better to have something like two velcro straps that would wrap around the mirror on the open end to secure it and making install easier and also if the ridges were higher to keep the wedge in the proper position. The mirror piece is not a real mirror (at least not in any real sense of what you a mirror to be) so don't expect any picture perfect view - it's adequate.

Each tool is incredibly high quality, including the valve core tool and the tire gauge. Even the allen wrenches are high quality. These tools could stand daily abuse in a tire shop, it seems.The only complaint is that the kit is relatively simple and doesn't include many accessories. I'm not entirely sure what the black tubes that it comes with are, but they are very cheap looking plastic and don't seem very functional.The only downside (and what looses 1 star) is that the blow molded case is WAY to big. It is gigantic compared to the tools it contains. This whole kit should be at least 1\/3 the size. The fact that it is this big now means that I can't find any appropriate space\/room for it in my Wrangler JK. It sticks out like a sore thumb and storage space in a Jeep is at a premium to begin with.If you're the casual 5-10 time\/year user or less, then go with the Power Tank kit. It will suit you much better (it also has more accessories) because it is much smaller and lighter. If you're a heavy 1\/week user, then buy ARB.

{"asin":"B0006O1ICE","overall":5,"reviewText":"WHEN TO USE EPOXY CEMENTWhen you need a strong rigid workable (e.g. sandable and\/or paintable surface) adhesive, particularly for use on metal or hard plastic, epoxy is usually the best choice.  Most epoxies dry with little running or shrinkage, and so are good for filling gaps.  The major drawback to epoxies is that they consist of two parts (resin and hardener) which must be mixed in small batches, and then applied with your own applicator (e.g., a toothpick or popsicle stick). Some are packaged in a dual-syringe--but that is not an adequate solution, because the components must still be manually mixed in order harden to maximum strength.WHEN TO USE JB-WELDJB-Weld is a very strong epoxy cement.  JB-Weld is the cement\/glue of choice when joining metal parts or filling holes in metals.  Otherwise, ordinary epoxy cement or other types of cements\/glues are usually better choices.  Some other reviewers have complained that the descriptive name \"weld\" is inappropriate---to some extent that's true.  JB Weld can do some jobs welding can't.  Conversely some simple welding jobs like joining two thin metal rods at right angles are difficult with JB Weld.HOW TO USE JB-WELDGeneral Principles: Although JB WELD makes an excellent filler---and can even be used to cast small parts, it is not remotely as strong as real metal used this way.  Whenever possible, use JB WELD as an adhesive---a very thin layer of JB WELD holding two pieces of metal together.  Always reinforce with metal pieces when possible.  For example, rather than building up a massive flange with JB Weld, you might be able to use scrap peice of metal to form most of the flange, held in place with JB Weld.  The greater the relative surface area of contact, the strong the bond will be.Surface Preparation:  As with any adhesive, the surface must be clean and rough.  Clean with a solvent (according to another reviewer, acetone is the best solvent for this purpose, but rubbing alcohol will work), roughen the surface, then clean with the solvent again.  Use a clean cloth for each application of solvent.  I generally use a small grinding wheel in a Dremel tool to roughen the surfaces.  You can also scratch the surface with a knife, or use coarse sandpaper, or both depending on the material.The solvent cleaning is for removing the LAST TRACES of oil from CLEAN surfaces.  If the parts are oily, even multiple cleanings with solvent may not be enough---you may redeposit oil from your cleaning cloth or as the solvent evaporates on the surface.  So, if you can detect any oil on any portion of the part, or if you have any doubt, clean it with a degreaser first.  If you do not have a commercial degreaser handy, a paste of laundry detergent and a stiff brush may do the trick.  Only when you are certain that there are no traces of oil is it time for the solvent cleaning(s).Joining Broken Parts: If you are joining broken parts, with a clean but irregular matching surfaces, limit the roughening to scratching with a wire brush or etching with an acid (but be sure to wash off all traces of the acid). Apply a THIN uniform layer of JB WELD, lightly clamp together hard enough to squeeze out any excess. Sometimes a thick rubber band is perfect. Often you can arrange pieces so that the weight of the top piece will hold the joint together until the JB Weld cures. Sometimes you can place a weight (such as a brick) on top to apply gentle pressure.  Do not remove the clamp or pressure until the JB Weld has cured completely.  After an hour or two, after the glue has set but is still soft, you can cut off any excess with a knife or razor---but if you don't need to cut the excess off, don't.  Often you can build-up the surfaces around a break for added strength.  Sometimes blue painters tape can be used to help hold pieces together while the glue sets, and\/or to make a temporary stand to hold the pieces in the best orientation.ScotchBlue Painter's Tape for Multi-Surfaces 2090-.75A, 3\/4 Inches by 60 Yards, 1 RollJoining Dissimilar Parts:  Minimize any gaps if possible, e.g., by sanding if possible so that the contact as perfect as possible.  If you will be filling substantial gaps, sometimes it is helpful to cover openings with blue painters tape to prevent the JB Weld from flowing away and leaving gaps.Joining Long Thin Parts (rods or sheets): Try to overlap if possible, or reinforce them with a similar overlapping peice of metal glued in place with JB Weld.  To join a 1\/8\" steel rod, to another 1\/8\" steel rod, forming a \"T\" (a common and easy welding job, almost impossible with just JB-Weld), cut two 1\"-long \"L's\" from a heavy-paper clip, (or make L's from similar wire), and embed those with JB-Weld on opposite sides of the joint.  You can further strenthen the joint by wrapping fine steel wire around the rods holding the \"L\"s in place---before  covering it all with JB-Weld.  Be sure to thoroughly clean the rods and wires first (see below).  For small parts, or when wire wouldn't work well, unwaxed dental floss is remarkably strong, and can do an excellent job of reinforcing joints (when embeded in JB Weld). Ideally, apply the JB Weld, then wind the floss tightly into the soft JB Weld.Filling Holes:  Don't forget to prepare the surfaces as described above---even if you can only roughen the surfaces with an ice pick or awl.  JB Weld shrinks very little as it cures so fill the hole completely.  If it is possible to sand the surface when the JB Weld has hardened, then overfill the hole slightly.  Since JB Weld flows a little until it sets, the surface should be horizontal.  If not horizontal, you can apply the JB Weld and then cover the hole with blue painters tape until the JB Weld sets.  Depending on the job, it is often a better strategy to fill the gap as much as possible with a piece (or pieces) of metal embedded in JB Weld that a single mass of pure JB Weld.Reinforcing a leaking pipe:  Work JB Weld into a piece of fiberglass cloth or with a spatula, apply, and then add more JB Weld to any thin spots and to feather out the edges. You may have to apply several layers of the JB Weld-saturated fiberglass cloth. Sometimes wire cloth (window screening) can be used.Holes in car body panels etc:  If you can cover at least one side of the hole with a piece of sheet metal (held in place by JB Weld) that is a good strategy---the combination of pop-rivets and JB Weld often works especially well, even if you ultimately sand the heads of the pop rivets away.TEKTON 6555 Rivet Gun with 40-pc. RivetsMixing:  Follow the instructions.  A paper plate can be a good mixing surface; popsicle sticks are the best mixing tools.  Beware that you must use the same amount of resin and hardener, and they MUST be VERY thoroughly mixed.  Mix until you are certain that it is completely and thoroughly mixed, and then continue mixing for twice that time.  Seriously!!!Curing:  Follow the instructions, but wait longer than recommended: the longer you wait the stronger the bond.  A a day or two at 70 or 80 degrees is a reasonable MINIMUM.  Note that epoxies do not \"dry\"--there are no solvents to evaporate, instead a chemical reaction hardens the cement (a plastic resin).  Chemical reactions are proportional to temperature (the rule of thumb is that for each 10 degrees, the reaction speed doubles).  Using the rule of thumb, if it takes 1 day to cure at 80 degrees, then it takes 16 days to cure at 40 degrees, and that's only to minimally cured.  Okay, I know that waiting this long is not practical in many circumstances---you can probably get away with curing for 4 hours at 90 degrees (but don't go much higher than 90 degrees), and \"take it easy\" for a couple of days.WHEN TO USE OTHER EPOXIESFor materials other than metal, particularly for rigid plastics, other epoxies are usually better than JB Weld.  Some epoxies are clear, or white, or specialized for particular purposes.  For exampleCLEARBOND H-3S Clear Strong Epoxy Adhesive Syringe - .85ozWHEN TO USE QUICK-EPOXIESOrdinary (slow) epoxies (whether JB Weld or other epoxies) dry harder than quick epoxies and are generally the best choice.  Maximum strength is the whole point of epoxies--if you don't need maximum strength---you probably do not need epoxy.  Use quick epoxies when 1) the hardening speed is essential, 2) when the item cannot be supported in the required orientation while the epoxy sets (at least several hours), or 3) when you have to absolutely minimize flowage.  Super-glue is often a good alternative in such situations.WHEN TO USE OTHER CEMENTS OR GLUESWhile epoxies are ideal for a few specific uses (primarily when you need a rigid cement for metal or rigid plastic)--there are many situations when other types of glue are better choices.  Epoxies are generally NOT recommended for flexible surfaces, such as leather, wood, or flexible plastic, and generally do not adhere well to glass, etc.  While epoxies may work with porous surfaces (paper, wood, ceramics, etc.), other adhesives are usually better.White Glue: For most light-duty indoor household applications which do not have to be waterproof, ordinary household white glue is safe, cleanup is very easy, and in most cases repairs are redo-able if you make a mistake.  White glue shrinks a great deal as it dries, and so is not good for filling holes or large gaps.  For example:Elmer's All Multipurpose White Glue, 7 5\/8 oz. (E379)Glue Stick: Think of glue sticks as thick white household glue in stick form.  Glue sticks are great with paper, but have few other applications.Avery Glue Stic, 0.26 oz, Pack of 6, (98095)Wood Glue: Carpenters's wood glue is essentially water-proof (when dry) white household glue.  It penetrates and strengthens the wood better than any other type of glue. It is safe, and cleanup is easy. If the joint breaks again (because the wood is weak), it can be re-glued. For example:Elmer's E701 Carpenter's Wood Glue 8-OunceGoop:  Goop will bond virtually any material, including leather, plastics, glass, and metal.  The bond is clear, VERY strong, waterproof, and hard but flexible.  Since Goop is clear, if a little extra oozes out, it is barely noticeable. I've used Goop to repair ceramic plant pots, water hoses, and shoes; to seal holes in air-mattresses, to close small holes in window screens, as plumbers paste in assembling plumbing parts, to  I also use it to seal rust spots on my dishwasher rack--the Goop it also makes a \"cushioned\" surface that will prevent scratches to dishes.  Goop is particular good for repairing damaged electrical cords.Amazing Goop All-Purpose Household Goop, 3.7-Ounce Tube #130012Silicon Glue: Silicon glue is best for glass, and when you want a truly flexible connection (for example, to absorb vibrations). It is a good alternative for Goop for general household use on glass, plastic, and metal when you do not need the maximum possible strength. It is safer than Goop, and cleanup is easier. Like Goop, silicon glue takes days to reach reasonable strength, weeks to reach maximum strength. For example:GE Silicone II Household Glue, 2.8 ozFabric Glue:Beacon Fabri-Tac Permanent Adhesive, 4-Ounceworks amazingly well on fabrics, saturating the surfaces enough to provide a very strong bond, but without soaking through.  Depending on the application, fabric glue can be better than sewing.  It remains very flexible, e.g., it would probably be great on leather or heavy vinyl (e.g., women's handbags, shoes, luggage, etc.)Super-Glue (Krazy Glue): Super-glue is very strong, rigid, and fast. In many ways it is similar to 2-minute epoxy---except that no mixing is required. Although very hard, super-glue is brittle, and so, is not recommended for flexible objects. Super-glue is hazardous in that it can easily glue fingers (etc.) together.  Previously, I used super-glue frequently on objects (e.g., jewelry) when a clear bond was required---however, Goop is better for such applications, safer, and more conveneient. Opened super-glue keeps poorly, even in tighly sealed glass containers---so I recommended packages of multiple very small tubes.BAZIC Super Glue, 3 grams 0.10 ounces, 6 Per PackLiquid Nails\/Construction Adhesive:  When you need to permanently join a large amount of surface, of almost any kind, Construction Adhesive is usually ideal. If you need to join 2 2x4s to make a 4x4 Construction Adhesive is better than nails.  Most construction adhesives are slightly flexible, and so can even be used on leather (i.e., to repair a loose shoe sole), etc.  Construction adhesive may leave a stain on porous surfaces, and may stain-through thin surfaces.  For small projects, Goop is usually a better choice.Caulking Compound:  You can think of caulking compound as white household glue with alot of inert filler--to use when you need to fill holes.  As an adhesive, it is the weakest on this list, but is strong enough for many purposes when spread over a large surface, such as the back of a ceramic tile.  A few years ago, I made a brick column to support a mailbox.  Traditionally, I should have used mortar--which would have been very time consuming.  I could have used construction adhesive (albeit any excess that squeezed out would have been ugly)--but caulking compound was quick, cheap, looks good, and was more than adequate for the job.","reviewerID":"AI0BCEWRE04G0","unixReviewTime":1332892800}

Gloves are a nice idea.One thing I might note: I let the Jeep idle while I fill and the unit sounds like it's cycling up or down, but I've concluded this is due to additional loads on the battery switching on and off while your vehicle runs. It's particularly noticeable if your air conditioning is on while you fill.I've used this unit 4 times since I got it, and have been impressed every time.

The remote fobs are excellent and the range seems to be pretty darn good.I installed it into a 1996 F250 with an OEM non remote power lock setup. Power locks are nice but without a remote setup their usefulness is somewhat limited. I did a search here on Amazon and came up with this setup for far less than I expected. After reading many of the reviews I knew the instructions would be lacking but decided to give it a try anyway. I'm glad I did.This system isn't super advanced but does offer a couple of features other than just locking and unlocking the doors if you choose to use them. One feature is the notification system. The system shows a wire being hooked to the \"direction light.\" This wire \"flashes\" once for lock and twice for unlock. The idea is to connect this to your outside directional lights to give you a visual indication that the system either locked or unlocked the doors. I didn't utilize this feature but if I did I think I would connect it to the horn instead of the lights. Just a way to confirm to myself that I did indeed lock the doors before walking away. There is also a wire for unlocking the trunk but with the exception of a label in the instructions there is no indication as to whether this is actually active in this system.A feature that would be nice is to allow the user the ability to \"setup\" some features. One feature that some may like is to allow the user the ability to change the output of the \"flash\" output. I would prefer one flash for unlock and two for lock but there is no way to change this. For the price of this unit though it would be hard to really fault this system for its \"basicness.\"The last issue here to discuss is the instructions, or lack of them. The reality is that it would be very difficult to include very extensive instructions because each installation is going to depend on the model of vehicle you are installing this into. A better layout of the basic drawings would be nice though. It took me a little while to figure out exactly how the diagrams related to the included unit but I did figure it out. By far the more difficult part was coming up with the vehicle specific diagrams. the service manual I had included the wrong diagrams and therefore added a lot of work to this installation. That is not the fault of the maker of this unit though, that is a problem with my service manual.Overall I would highly recommend this unit to anyone who feels they can figure out the wiring. If wiring diagrams confuse you and vehicle wiring scares you, then I recommend you either buy something else or have this installed by a professional. Personally I think it works great and was well worth the effort to figure it out.","reviewerID":"AJCHGS1GND4OA","unixReviewTime":1376784000}

{"asin":"B002BEI0JQ","overall":4,"reviewText":"I have an original California Jelly Blade that I bought from Amazon. I was surprised I couldn't reorder, so looked around and started reading the reviews. I bought a Pilot Automotive CC-2010 and really didn't like it. The handle was too hard and the blade felt short. Frustrated, I tracked down the website that seemed to be for the manufacturer and wrote the following email:\"Hi Don,I'm one of many who came to greatly appreciate the original California Jelly Blade, and am looking for a replacement. Every review comparing \"Superflex\" with the original says it is too flexible. The Pilot ultraflex is no longer available if it ever was. The \"Soft-N-Dry\" doesn't work well and the handle is too hard for the shower. (I bought one.) The California Car Duster Jelly blade is clearly avoiding the original patents and isn't a \"t-bar\" blade. Your website has a \"gel\" version that doesn't appear to be for sale anywhere.My questions:1) Which one is closest to the original original?2) Where can I buy it?3) Why not make one to those specs again?Thanks!Larry\"I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Don is the inventor. Here is his reply:\"Larry, I quite frankly can't understand people not liking the Superflex that is what i prefer and I designed them all, I have all of them in my garage and I'll grab the Superflex every time. The Gel blade was turned down because of cost, I designed that model as well, however I still prefer the Superflex. Feel free to call if you have questions!!  Don\"So I bought a Superflex and it is good, but not quite as good as the original. The handle is right. The length is right. Whew. However, it really is, as some suggested, too flexible. Not a lot too flexible, but just enough that it takes a little more concentration, a little more feedback to use it. Hence the four stars. However, it works very, very well, and is better than the original on curved surfaces such as my car.I believe this is, as Don suggests, the right one to buy. However, I wish it would be just a little stiffer, say halfway between where it is now and the original. Then we're moving forward with this product and I'm not longing for a past product I can no longer buy.","reviewerID":"AK3GVZMOZL8ZS","unixReviewTime":1362009600}

As rainy season was about over, decided to keep them in the garage until a couple of days ago.  Installed them easily.Fired them up to try them,,,,windshield was wet from morning dew.  Streaked badly.However drove off with them on as was in a hurry and felt that I would deal them later.Later yesterday, got a bit of rain.  Turned them on, they streaked so badly that almost unable to see at all,,,,the left side far worse than right side.Windshield is clean and smooth,,,,no roughness or defects.Today I called Rain-X support  1-800-416-1600 and spoke to a lady named Adrian.Told her of my issues.  She asked when purchased.  I said March 2012 and installed a couple of days ago.  She then said that there blades were only good for 6 to 12 months.  I told her that had been stored.  She asked if in \"temperature controlled environment\"?. I said in the garage where temp never exceeds 85 degrees and were kept in original packaging in a dark closet.  She said that was the problem.I told here that the original wipers on the Toyota Rav 4 were 3 years old and still functioned better than Rain-x that were 6 months old, stored properly,,,not exposed to elements and never used, and yet were far worse in smearing of windshield than the old originals.She then told me that they have 90 day warranty and with receipt I could return.  I said that I purchased 6 months ago and had kept for when I would need them.  She said that was too bad and there was nothing that could be done,,,,,that my improper storage was why they failed.I asked her if 3 year old originals that had been used and baked in the sun and elements were superior to Rain-X blades that had been stored properly for 6 months and unused.  She said that she was not suggesting that at all.As an aside,,,,made in Korea, assembled in China.Cannot understand why Rain-X even provides a Customer Support number,,,,as there certainly is no support here.

{"asin":"B000DZXIJM","overall":4,"reviewText":"I'll start this review by being very upfront.  I like my car to look NICE, but I don't like doing the work involved with making it look like that.  Luckily, my husband has always dutifully waxed all of our vehicles, even though he had never particularly enjoyed the job either.  So, this review is pretty much based on his experiences.  He's not a computer sort of guy though, so it's up to me to do the review.  =)Last summer our neighbor (who has an obsession with washing\/waxing his vehicles), told my husband about this Ice Liquid Polish.  Since my car was due for waxing, hubby went off to the local Wally World to buy a bottle.  I think he paid $16-$17 for it, and it included a sponge applicator and a small microfiber towel.Now, washing and waxing a car is normally a 1\/2 day project for my hubby.  About 40 minutes after he pulled my car out of the garage to wash and wax it (with the Ice), he came back into the house, plopped on the couch and turned on the game.  I assumed he was tired and taking a break before he finished the car up.  Much to my suprise, I found out he was completely finished...including cleaning my (pain in the butt) multi-spoked wheels.Since then, he makes it a point to wax my car with the Ice about every 2 months...simply because it doesn't take very long.  The bottle, is still between 2\/3 to 3\/4 full, after 4 wax jobs.  Granted, my car is pretty small (Chrysler Crossfire SRT-6), but it looks like this bottle is going to last for at least 12-14 waxes.  That works out to about $1.20 per wax job.Besides the benefit of getting my car waxed now on a more frequent basis, I like the fact that this doesn't leave a white residue on the trim of the car.  Hubby was always really bad about doing this with the previous types of wax he used, and my car would look sloppy as a result.So why did I give this 4 stars instead of 5?  There is a downside...it isn't long lasting.  According to Turtle Waxes own website ( [...] it will bead water and shine for at least 3 to 4 months under normal weather conditions.  The website also says to apply Ice at least 4 times a year to keep the finish protected.  Luckily, my hubby hasn't had a problem with applying this pretty often, but it is disconcerting that the product only lasts for an average of 3 months.I don't drive my Crossfire in the winter months (it is garaged), but I personally wouldn't rely on this particular product in the harsh winter driving months.  But for a car like mine, which is garaged in the winter and never sees salt, it seems to be a good and convenient product.","reviewerID":"ALQ4USPEQ9L5N","unixReviewTime":1202601600}

If you don't, you'll be cleaning up the contents of your glovebox from the floor when you're done replacing your CAF. Next step is to look on the right side and unhook the dampener. Next, squeeze the rear of the glovebox sides inwards to be able to let the glovebox swing all the way down.Looking inside, you'll see a tray with latches on both sides. Press those latches inwards and start sliding the tray out.When you put your new CAF into the tray, make sure you follow the arrow on the filter as the air is meant to flow through in one direction. The air flow is down. If you forget, the tray has an arrow on it also that says &#34;air flow&#34;.To finish the job, reverse the proceedures above. Slide the tray in, click into place, rotate the glovebox up and let it snap into place, replace the dampener bar, then close the glovebox.","reviewerID":"AMDBZ5P0GAT69","unixReviewTime":1354406400}

{"asin":"B0014Y82UQ","overall":3,"reviewText":"This brand of wiper blades is satisfactory but nothing special. As it is I replaced a Delco clear vision blade that in my opinion was superior and I will be re-installing it. If for some reason it fails, this one will meet the need but it is not an item I will be seeking out. The contour wiper has a lower profile with the hook lock attachment that my car uses but the obtrusiveness of the Delco (and Bosch) wipers is not an annoyance for me.The ANCO wiper is a lower cost item comparable to OE equipment on many vehicles. It's only been a short time and as a new unit it works without squeaks, streaks or smearing. As it is, I had it in the trunk of the car since it hadn't rained for quite some time and only after encountering a cloud burst a few days ago I stopped under an overpass and switched it with my current perfectly good Delco wiper. Obviously, the install is pretty simple as each of my cars employs the snap on hook lock system.  I didn't notice any discernible separation at highway speeds which may occur with some bracketless wipers. For whatever reason bracketless wipers seem to have a degree of separation at the very tip on the bottom of the windshield on the passenger side as they age and I do not anticipate this will be any different. As an aside, I noticed on a pre-owned vehicle lot the other day, virtually every car there had the same bowing at the tip of the wiper.The wiper filament of this blade is thinner than the Delco Clear Vision or Bosch Clear Advantage Blades so although I am confident it will be fine throughout the spring and summer, I am not sure it would last through the severe conditions of winter in my area. I also cannot comment about durability however just based on the differences in filament thickness I believe the life of this blade will be less than the others, rendering the moderate cost savings over the premium brands at initial purchase less significant.","reviewerID":"AMUP8DYE7EAN2","unixReviewTime":1368057600}

Pontiac used other shades of blue through the years, though this blue stands out with the metallic flake. As the previous review notes, apply in thin coats, it goes on a lot easier if you do. You can apply normal coats anywhere there is casting but on flat surfaces you really need to apply light coats.If you're cleaning up or rebuilding a Pontiac motor, there's no law that says you have to paint it the correct blue for the engine\/car's year. I'm using this color on a 77' 400, and the motor is going into a 1981 Trans Am!Don't forget to useDupli-Color DE1612 Engine primerfirst! This is especially important on non-course surfaces.Heads Up: Pontiac heads will eventually burn off the paint applied along the exhaust ports. From the past 2 years of car shows I've been to, I haven't seen a single Pontiac where the paint isn't burned off over those ports. The only thing I have seen that did work is someone used a cast iron exhaust manifold higher temp paint along the exhaust runners, which looked as if it was part of the exhaust manifolds.

The first thing I noticed after mounting it and closing the hood was that the design of the unit was going to exaggerate a problem with the hood on the highway or heavy headwinds.  The jeep hood already has a slight issue with catching wind and bouncing up and down, but, the design of this unit has the Deflector jutting straight out before curving upward.  This creates an even larger point to catch wind and creating drag forcing the hood to jump even worse and at lower speeds so you tend to be watching the hood movement even more than normal.  Second issue I had with the part was the quality of the forming, at least with my part.  Once inside the jeep I noticed that the right side looked lower so I checked the mounting and everything was exactly the same as the left side.  Checking closer it was apparent that the right side was slightly misformed, it had more bend than the right so that the top of the deflector was lower(closer) to the hood than the left.

{"asin":"B00AX4TWCA","overall":4,"reviewText":"In my mind, there are three leading auto glass 'sealant' treatments out there - Rain-X, Aquapel, and this product, Griot's Glass Sealant.  Aquapel is the most expensive of the three, and as far as i can tell, it is the clear leader in terms of function and longevity.  But for about as much as this 8 oz bottle costs, you get one or possibly two Aquapel applicators, each of which contains just enough solution to treat one windshield or rear window.  But there is no question that Aquapel is pretty miraculous stuff - properly applied, it makes rain skitter across your windshield and fly off into the ozone, and it remains effective for months, even with frequent trips to the local car wash.Griot's Glass Sealant and Rain-X appear to me to be more or less equivalent and second tier.  Both will go on relatively easy.  Both will give your auto glass a clear coating that has moderate water-shedding properties.  Both seem to last a few weeks at most before requiring a new coat.But if you do not mind applying Glass Sealant every few weeks - and it really is not a chore - and if you do not demand the somewhat amazing rain shedding properties of Aquapel, then this reasonably priced 8 ounce bottle of the stuff represents good value for money.  Me, I'm willing to spend the extra coin for the Aquapel treatment.  Here in the Pacific Northwest, it's really nice to be able to cruise along at 30 or 40 mph and watch the rain literally fly off your windshield, driven away by the force of the wind on the glass - you barely need to use your wipers.  Glass Sealant doesn't quite amaze, but it does make your wipers work far more effectively than they do on untreated glass.","reviewerID":"AP6ZL52YA27W5","unixReviewTime":1396915200}

One can drop a four wheel drive on these puppies and they're not going flex.  Or one can get their sports car up to a \"DECENT\" working height of a shade under twenty-four inches.It doesn't matter if these have a capacity of six tons each or they're six tons for two of them because they're shipped and you're going use them......as a pair.  Our full size F-250, with tool boxes is 8,800 pounds so what do I care if they're not six tons each?  They're going be holding up a single corner or side of the vehicle at a time.  In the meantime, the spec sheet packaged inside the box the jack stands are packed in, clearly spec these jacks at 6T \"each.\"If you need to be reassured, call the manufacture's customer service line between 8-5 PST @ 1-888-448-6746 and let customer service tell you directly what the truth is regarding any of your questions.On our jack stand copy, I checked the delivered jack stand base welds and found all gusset welds and manufacturing quality control, to be good to excellent manufacturing\/welding.  I checked out the stamped sheet metal parts and found the stamped sheet metal work to be \"excellent.\"  There was nothing in the manufacturing of our jack stands that would seem abnormal (a standout), cheap or inappropriate for a product of this kind.This is not a high end, tech grade, stainless steel, high pressure fitting where each weld is x-ray'd.  This is a typical red and black jack stand one uses at home or a shop to support a car, pickup, flatbed or box truck for the purpose of safely making repairs under a jacked up vehicle.  Used normally, with safety in mind during proper placement, there's no reason to believe that if you use these jack stands, you won't be able to safely get under a vehicle, make your repairs and get on to the next item on your check list.Overall, I am very pleased with the pair of auto jacks we received and I feel comfortable recommending these beasts to all who find themselves to be mechanically inclined and in need of safely crawling around under their jacked up vehicle.","reviewerID":"APGE05SC50SPL","unixReviewTime":1376179200}

Slip the blade onto the arm, close the cap, and you have a no-metal-parts, bridgeless, bracketless, full-contact wiper blade that resists freezing and \"blow-off\" at high speeds. Installation is easy due to the innovative design -- the hardest part of the replacement is getting the old blades off. Once you switch to the Evolution Blade, replacement is, literally, \"a snap\".I've tried 'em all -- Anco, Trico, RainX, etc., and these are the best wipers that I've ever used. Highly Recommended !!UPDATE: During a 1,150-mile trip to and through the mountains of Southern California, it was during a severe rainstorm that the Bosch Evolution Wiper Blades proved to be capable of performing perfectly under downpour conditons in the dark of night. Full, firm contact of the blades against the windshield gave a perfect wipe for every stroke -- we could all see through the windshield, but it was raining so hard that we couldn't see more than 100 feet ahead, anyways !!My daughter was so impressed with the Evolutions on my Grand Marquis, she ordered a 3-piece-set for her Land Cruiser -- from Amazon, of course !!Take a tip -- Check your wiper fitment carefully before ordering. The Land Cruiser mentioned above has a 20-inch blade on the Driver's side, a 21-inch blade on the Passenger's side, and a 16-inch blade on the Rear window.Modern windshield configurations have made different-size wiper blades common, so it all-ways pays to check.UPDATE #2 -- A 2,000-mile trip through the mountains of Arizona, Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming during the late-summer \"monsoon\" was the perfect test for the \"Evolution\" wiper blades -- with torrential rains, Nickle-sized hailstones, and severe winds combining to bring visibility to near-zero, the Bosch Evolution wiper blades ran quietly, wiped clean, and stayed streak-free through it all !!My order arrived promptly and in perfect condition.

I recently moved to the coast of southern Georgia, where there are a lot of bugs.  I was used to a lot of bugs having lived in rural Pennsylvania and Maryland, but some of the bugs down here are...messier...for whatever reason.  I also park under trees at the house and the office, and with the higher consistent temperatures, sap has become a real issue. I have noticed already that this bug wash does a great job of getting the sap off the windshield where the typical blue stuff I had been using tended to smear or do nothing to the windshield.  This bug wash gets it all off as far as I can tell.I am ordering another bottle for my wife's minivan!Note:  I was completely out of washer fluid when I put this in, so I am using it full strength right out of the bottle.  I cannot speak to its effectiveness if it is mixed with other washer fluids or water.Update 11.11.13I have used an entire reservoir on my car since I bought the first bottle, and I am buying more to replace it.  It continues to work well in getting off the sap and the bugs.  There are some drops of sap from a large pine tree in our yard that take a few tries to get off because they are so thick, but this Prestone Bug Wash does the trick.  I did add it to my wife's minivan after my initial review, topping off her tank, which had about a 1\/4 of a reservoir left of the \"blue\" stuff.  It works well on the van, even diluted with normal washer fluid.  I still highly recommend this washer fluid if you are dealing with tree sap.  It works on bugs too, but I've noticed it more on the sap.","reviewerID":"APS831ZLF95PS","unixReviewTime":1377820800}

So these Zwipe Microfiber Wash Mitts take that superior cleaning concept to the car wash.  The mitts have long microfiber fingers that increase surface area to retain moisture and suds while aiding in washing.  They slip on easily and have an elastic band at the wrist to help keep them on your hands.  You get two mitts for the price paid, so you can either wash with both hands for faster car washing or use the other mitt to dry your car (I found it works better than a chamois).  When they get dirty you can toss them in the laundry to get them clean as new.There is absolutely nothing to dislike about these mitts.  They absorb moisture well and make it easier to do detail cleaning of your car.  These mitts are obviously marketed for washing cars, but they could just as easily be used for fast and easy dusting at home.  They are clearly more expensive than a car wash sponge, but their versatility and function make their added cost very worthwhile.  Highly recommended.","reviewerID":"ATLA5CJH0ZZHP","unixReviewTime":1393804800}

{"asin":"B000MSDKMA","overall":5,"reviewText":"After doing a lot of research on AGM batteries, I finally decided on this one.  This was a Birthday gift for my son, to be installed in his '03 Subaru Forester.I started out looking at the Optima Red Top, but the reviews were not as as good & people I know have had problems with their Red Top battery failing.  Now the choice was between the Sears DieHard Platinum & the Optima Yellow Top.The Sears DieHard Platinum looks like a very good battery & it's said to be made by Odyssey.  Not really sure thats true?  What pushed me over to the Optima Yellow Top was the heaver weight, much higher cost & shipping hassles if I went with the Sears DieHard Platium.The Optima Yellow Top was delivered quickly by UPS.  It comes in a heavy-duty, double walled cardboard box.  The battery inside the box was protected with more cardboard packing & the top of the battery was covered with a protective plastic cover.  With the attached removable lift handle, the battery was easy to remove from the shipping box.  The battery was in perfect condition!We found the Optima Yellow Top sits lower than a standard type 35 battery.  Not a problem, since a spacer is provided, which snaps onto the bottom of the battery.  This made the battery fit perfectly in my son's '03 Subaru Forester.  The battery comes fully charged, so once we hooked up the cables, the engine started right up!We would recommend this battery & the plan is to install one of these in our other 2 vehicles.&#9658; Update - October 23, 2012Since I wrote this review, I bought another Optima Yellow top for our '95 Neon Sport.  I should note that this isn't a direct replacement for the stock battery in the stock location!  We relocated the battery to the trunk & a sealed battery (less chance of gassing) was the way to go.  We completed this project over the summer & it was a complete success!As to the previous battery installed in the my son's '03 Subaru Forester.  It's been 100% trouble free! :)","reviewerID":"ATMHSONJ55YN6","unixReviewTime":1337212800}

I started using mothers and meguiars through advice from friends.  Although the shine of those products was appealing, the labor used to constantly update the shine on my car was a deterrent.  After perusing forums and always seeing the orange bottle on the shelves of car care stores I decided to purchase a bottle and try it out on my girlfriends car.  Her silver metallic vw golf that is left out in the hot and salty hawaiian sun was in dire need of protection.  All I did was wash the car with meguiars NXT car wash, given to me free from a fried leaving the island, and then I applied the nufinish.  It was a benefit to be able to apply the polish in the sun.  The polish went on as easy as any wax that i've used, just make sure to use a damp applicator as many people have noted.  Removal was just as easy, using a microfiber cloth I removed all the polish and what was left behind was a beautifully shining vw golf.  I even surprised my gf, when she saw the car she was really impressed.I then tried the polish on my pearl white 2010 RD and was equally impressed with the results.  I even applied the polish to all of the windows, which was easier than applying rain-x.  Also, I applied the polish to my rims and that made them sparkle.  All I can say is that I'm a convert.  To me, the shine is just as good as a carnauba wax and should hold up much longer.  Even if it lasts only half a year, that's much longer than what carnauba can do.Reading the forums on car care, you read a lot of people bash nufinish because it's cheap, those people can pay whatever they want for high priced waxes that last for 2 months at most.  I'll stick with nufinish to protect my vehicles.Next up, my mother's SL550, and maybe my next outrigger canoe","reviewerID":"ATNOI7E8GTIVE","unixReviewTime":1283904000}

I'll try not to be too redundant.This gauge has a nice large read-out, a back-lit screen, and a light built in to help align things in the dark, all of which are great. A downgrade comes in because of simple problems, like the light switch activating inside the case and subsequently discharging the batteries, rendering the gauge useless when you need it. If you plan to have one in each vehicle, then the single car memory isn't an issue, but I prefer to leave the gauge in the garage for all to share so a single memory function is of little value to me. I gave it 3 stars simply because if one is willing to be extra careful with the light switch when storing, is happy with only one memory function, and is willing to take the time to learn how to correctly align the gauge and put up with the sensitive seal, then it is at least nice to have such an easy-to-read display. There are better designs out there, though, and C. MacPhail's review provided a couple. My favorite Topeak D2 SmartGauge is a bit pricey but it works very well for Presta valves (many bikes) as well as the more common Schrader valve found on cars and other bikes. It's accurate up to 250 psi, has a swivel head, and it's very small (about half the size of this gauge.","reviewerID":"ATOKT8QYK967L","unixReviewTime":1372204800}

The map light is a bit more complicated. It appears GMC puts resistors in the rear map lights to reduce the intensity of the map lights. This is really a good idea because if your rear passengers turn on the lights in the back, it will impair the drivers ability to see the road. The tings is, while this does dim the LED lights, they are not as forgiving to the dimming effect and are simply not putting out enough light. Because the lights is so directed from these SMD LED lamps, I don't think they would interfere with the driver. I plan on removing the resistor to get a bit more output from these. That is a project for a future day. Until then, they work GREAT in the dome area.NOTE: Unlike standard incandescent lights, LED lamps are polarity sensitive in DC systems. If you install these and they dont work, turn them around.","reviewerID":"ATPFSP7ARPDXO","unixReviewTime":1384300800}

I am on a quest to make perfect pancakes and could never keep my griddle at the perfect pancake temperature (360 F). I made the best batch of pancakes in my life after using this thermometer to adjust the surface temperature just so. And this morning, I made the best omelet I've ever cooked (at 325 F).I chose this model as it claims to have better accuracy than comparably priced competitors (1.5%, or 1.5C (3F) whichever is greater). This might not be good enough for medical applications, but for cooking, car repair, or home heating uses it's pretty good. Also, it claims a narrower beam than other products with a 10:1 distance to radius ratio, allowing more accurate scans at a distance. And, supposedly, one standard 9V battery will last 12 hours of use, which given that a single scan is typically 5 seconds might as well be for a lifetime.I've been quite happy with this product. I like the scan feature, where you can scan over an area keeping track of the hottest temperature. It's also nice that the optics are well shielded deep inside the device, making it unlikely I'll get fingerprints on them, and allowing me to stuff it in my pocket if needed.  And, I like the laser guide, which my son uses to play Buzz Lightyear (I'm very careful to not let him point it at his or my eyes).I'm so happy with this product, I'm thinking of giving them out as Christmas gifts this year.","reviewerID":"ATS2855497V0I","unixReviewTime":1189555200}

My old blade (a Michelin...looks almost identical) had started chattering and leaving a huge streak. Replacing it with this blade fixed the problems, but I suspect most new wipers would have. I did notice streaks near the edges of the blade, though, so this wiper isn't leaving as wide of a clear path as it should.If you have a car with \"opposing\" wipers (rather than both going in the same direction, they move towards each other, both attached at the lower corners), you will have to remove and rotate the attaching bracket in order to keep the \"spoiler\" on the top edge (this is illustrated in the instructions) on your passenger side.  A bit of a hassle, but not a huge deal.The price seems a little steep, currently $13.53 here, with a MSRP of an astounding $28! I can tell you these are DEFINITELY not worth $28. As $14 wipers, I would give these about 3.5 stars.  For $28, I would expect something really special, which these are not.  They are just okay.  For $28 wipers, I'd only give them two stars.Note: When I ordered these, it appeared that they would fit my Chrysler, but they do not (I needed the UB, rather than the OE, version).  My wipers have a J-shaped hook, and none of the adapters included with this version will work with that.

Thanks for an inexpensive and valuable tool.","reviewerID":"AYMU8V0X3NF0Q","unixReviewTime":1268179200}
{"asin":"B0087XOTWW","overall":3,"reviewText":"Other raters claim they are &#34;super bright&#34; and some complained about being too bright. They are white light as opposed to the warmer colored incandescent and in a side-by-side comparison they do not cast the same volume of light. I replaced all my RV lights and it feels dimmer inside compared with the stock lights.  Mind you they cast sufficient lighting and the wattage saving for dry camping is significant and they are cool to the touch.  However, if you are a full-hook up camper and don't NEED the wattage savings I wouldn't bother with the expence.  They are polorized so installing them is side specific therefore it's a 50-50 chance you have to rotate them on the install.  The volume of light issue rates them an okay and so far they are all working well. The price online is much cheaper than at Camping World or other retailers who want $10-$15 each!  Try a set on your &#34;most used lights&#34; first to see for yourself if you like the look before you invest in a total switch over to LED.","reviewerID":"AYMW143FPF0I5","unixReviewTime":1393891200}

{"asin":"B0002UQAY8","overall":3,"reviewText":"The Meguiar's buffer system takes a lot of getting used to because these pads are hook and loop attachment.  The hook and loop (Velcro) is not very strong, and it is glued to the foam.  This means 2 things...  the pads will fly off and have to be constantly re-centered and reattached while you're working.. and once they get hot the glue lets go and then you need a new pad.  This is very poor design for a buffer system that costs $150 for the tool and $0 per pad.  If you can get past those limitations, you will get a well buffed car.","reviewerID":"AYVW3O6W8S5S4","unixReviewTime":1360540800}

{"asin":"B000JFLSL6","overall":5,"reviewText":"The BatteryMinder #12248 is a 2\/4\/8 amp charger and the best charger i have ever used. It is built to last. Will quickly clean sulphur off the lead plates. Can make a weak to almost dead battery good again. Will increase the voltage even on a newer battery. This is now my favorite charger. Cannot hurt any battery. It just makes any battery much better. Will also maintain a battery better and safer than most other low amp maintenance chargers. No other battery charger compares to this model BatteryMinder, the #12248. I don't know about the other models, but this model does more and it is amazing. It cost more but this charger is probably 10 times better than the rest. I am getting more than my moneys worth, every time i use it. It will pay for itself by restoring an almost dead battery. It will actually make an old battery useable again and for a long long time. Don't bother with any more searching or reviewing of battery chargers. Just get this BatteryMinder model. You have now found the best! I should know, i have a shop. I know other auto shop owners that would rather just sell you a new battery. Most auto repair shops do not use this charger. They just test the battery for draw and voltage. You might easily get a couple more years out of your old battery if you use the BatteryMinder first. Enough said, bye.","reviewerID":"AZ4TULAIAL4DS","unixReviewTime":1403136000}

{"asin":"B003N9AT5G","overall":5,"reviewText":"I was away on business during a huge ice storm throughout the Philadelphia suburban region.  My wife called and told me that we had no power... along with about 700k other people.  After reading several reviews, I ordered this WEN 3500W generator via Amazon Prime, shipped overnight.  I flew home the next morning and found the generator waiting in my driveway.Setup was simple.  You need to attach the wheels and handles, fill with oil, fill with gas, and start her up.  Started on the first pull despite sitting out in below freezing weather all day.  I let the generator warm up for about 5 minutes, plugged in a lamp to test, and everything worked as expected.  I then connected a power cord to my oil furnace (disconnecting power cables in junction box between furnace and circuit breaker panel), plugged it in to the generator, and restored heat to the house.Over the next few days, I also hooked up several lights, our alarm clocks, our FiOS equipment, laptops, and phone chargers.  No issues.  I did not try the 240V connection.  There is not enough power to run my electric dryer or water heater, so I found no real need for 240V.  I didn't run my fridge because it was already too late -- I didn't get the generator hooked up until about two days after we lost power -- but I would hook up the fridge in the future.The power company finally restored power to our house about 50 hours after we first hooked up the generator.  We ran for a total of 35 to 40 hours.Some other things you might be interested to know:- I used Mobil 1 10W30 and changed the oil after the first night.  I have an oil extractor to &#34;suck&#34; the oil out, but you could probably drain by tipping the generator on it's side.  An oil extractor is clean and easy.- The generator ran my oil furnace for over 10 hours on a single tank.  The tank was near empty when I refilled, but 10+ hours is more than I expected.- The tank is labeled 4 gallons, but it seems to only take about 2.5 gallons.  (The tank was near empty when I refilled, and it was only 2.5 gallons.)- Put Stabil in your gas can before filling the generator.  I use Stabil in my gas cans for my lawnmower, tractor, leaf blower, weed whacker, jet ski -- it really helps avoid carb issues.- Plug things in after the generator is running, and unplug things before you shut it down.  I don't know if I would have an issue if I left things plugged in, but I don't want to find out.- Buy a few extension cords.- Generator makes noise, but we were able to sleep without issue.  My wife commented that it wasn't as loud as she expected.- Get a carbon monoxide detector and put it in the room closest to the generator.  We had no issues.Bottom line: Three hundred bucks to bring my house back to life was money well spent.  We are ready for the next ice storm, hurricane, or whatever surprise happens next.  We can run our furnace and fridge.  We will have lights.  I am happy with this purchase and would buy again.  You get much more for your money buying for Amazon than buying from the local big box store when everyone else is looking for a generator.","reviewerID":"AZD412AH3W49I","unixReviewTime":1392076800}

I dont know about you, but i hate the dangling block heater cord on the front of cars, not to mention if you dont seal it back up, the plug rusts. I used this to hide the cord inside my bumper. I drilled a hole up under the lower air dam, and installed it there. Now i just reach up under the front bumper, flip open the very sealed cover, and put in the extension cord. When you unplug the extension cord in the morning, you just flip the seal back closed and you cant see anything.
